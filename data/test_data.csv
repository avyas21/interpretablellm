Review,Sentiment
I’m excited to read this book. And was amazing shape,positive
Wonderful book but not crazy about using the word hate with the kids...too strong a word for the fun topic. We just read it and choose a different word to use in its place,positive
Storyline & characters are poorly developed. Bought on a friend’s advice—lousy read.,negative
Wow...fell in love with Pati on PBS. This is such a wonderful book of basics in Mexican cuisine.,positive
"My almost 4 year old daughter adores Fancy Nancy. I bought her this book for Easter. It has flaps inside that you lift to reveal fanciness underneath. My daughter loves it. The story isn't very developed. It is just Fancy Nancy setting up for their Elegant Easter party. No real conclusion- they never actually have the party. My daughter didn't seem to notice. She was too busy seeing what fancy things she could find under the little flaps. On story alone, it would get 2 stars. It being Fancy Nancy and my daughter adoring it bumps the star rating up a bit.",positive
Too small. Quality is just not good. I don't understand why this got so many good reviews. I sent it back for a refund.,negative
"First let me say that I am new to the vegan diet, so I have collected a handful of books I thought would help me... having said that - this cookbook has NO photos.  :(  But... it still has a long list of useful recipes.  Most are listed gluten free and soy free - if that matters to you.  At the top of each page and under the recipe name it tells you this info...  I haven't found any strange ingredients (meaning you can't find what you need at the local grocery store - as we live in a small rural town) and no super special pieces of kitchen equipment... so I consider that a bonus.  I am not a trained culinary chef and I manage to understand the process of these recipes... I am a fan of one pot cooking (in all fairness some of the recipes use more than one pot - but served in one bowl..), so this book appealed to me.  I like the Red Bean Gumbo (however I replace the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper as I am not a fan of green bell pepper and I omit the okra - not a fan of that either)...  very satisfying. In the book it mentions that &#34;gumbo&#34; is the African word for okra!  Hmm... I like gumbo... but sans the okra. haha.  In any case, I purchased this cookbook and a handful of others to help inspire me to try to eat vegan.  Now... if we could get them to add photos and a spiral back (to help keep the book open while you are using it in the kitchen) it would be a 6 star.  :)",positive
"This is really an interesting calendar. It is both educational and functional. It is almost sepia-toned and is non-descript in the sense that it is not as colorful as typical wall calendars. However, the first page shows four months of the previous year starting from September to December 2019. This is followed by 12 monthly pages with ample room to write appointments. I always love monthly calendars that have wide boxes for such details.<br /><br />I also like the natural-world-based information on each month. For instance, in January I learn that the norternmost part of the globe is the Artic Circle and that although I can drive over the northern ice cap with a truck, I would be driving on frozen sea ice and not land. There are about four facts per month.<br /><br />In summary, this calendar is appropriate for those who need big boxes to write appointments,  want to learn about the natural world, and do not mind that there are no colorful pictures but instead is almost septia-toned in its presentation.",positive
The imagery in this book is so good that I actually slept with my light on a few times. I chose this book because I'm a fan of horror in general and the exorcist is one of my all time favorites. I didn't have high expectations of this book because the subjects been over done but this book reeled me in from the very beginning.,positive
Purchased for my 80 year old mom to have something different to do in these trying times.  She likes it.  Having a spiral bound back would have made it a five star experience.,positive
"This is a pretty nice travel guide of France. The book is full of great information. There are photos, maps, or drawing on just about every page. Each section has suggested points of interest, food suggestions, and tips. It includes best ways to get around as well as where to stay. There's one pull out map of Paris. The pages are flat matte rather than glossy like some of the other well known travel guides. Overall, a useful travel guide.",positive
"I do not care for books that do not have a nice final happy ending as the resolution. I feel like if you pay for a full book, you deserve the chance to read a complete story that leaves you feeling satisfied at the end, not a big cliffhanger that says &#34;please by the next one in the series.&#34; The writing is competent, of course, from this multi-published author and it was an okay read. It has a lot of characters and different stories. It does switch from the first to third person point of view depending on who is speaking, which I also didn't care for as much. You can read it without reading the other books, although you can see some of the other characters popping in here and there. It was slow at times. Books that don't have a happy ending, or really an ending at all, are not for me.",negative
Andrew has so much to say that is helpful.  I absolutely LOVED THIS.  I was able to listen and follow through on much of it; it is a work in progress.,positive
"At the beginning of The two-Family House I would have given it 4 stars...it sucked me in right away, seemed like there'd be some bit of mystery, we'd see the characters grow and change...instead it was full of bitter nasty characters that got worse.  I kept waiting for how they'd redeem themselves or change, but I was very disappointed.  This book left me feeling sad, irritated and let down.",negative
I sent it back because I don’t read French.,negative
"This is a con. The materials are and preschool level, but worst of all is the requirement to upgrade to an Ultimate status. Maybe they teach you how to say &#34;hola&#34; there. Waste of time. Waste of money. Website less than helpful and no customer support number. Steer far, far clear. This is going back!",negative
To long winded.....story draged...yet to. Get to the end,negative
"Sad. NOT funny. But DESERVES four stars.  I finished it BECAUSE it was well written, but I would not have read it had I known what was coming.<br />Some of the blurbs at the beginning of One's Company called it a Black Comedy.  I did not laugh once.  In fairness, the novel is well written, hangs together, has some great characters and Bonnie Lincoln and how she proceeds when she wins a bazillion dollar lottery is amazingly wrought.  But it is a sad, introspective book about a very damaged woman who needs to live as  a character in Three's Company to survive. Bonnie is a woman in her early twenties who has only ever had exactly one friend.  Both her parents are dead and you would not call her family one that was memorable in a good way.  She's recently gone through a horrible trauma, coming out of a situation as the only survivor-- if you want to call it survival.<br />Somehow, the old sitcom, Three's Company, comforts her and she becomes obsessed.  When she wins the biggest lottery ever, Bonnie creates an alternate world for herself of the Three's Company set and sets things up so that she will live alone there and be one of the characters from the show each year, moving from apartment to apartment, but always existing in the 1970s.. We already know the concept of this novel going in.  It's in the blurbs. Personally, the best thing about the book, is what I THOUGHT it was going to be. Something light and silly and a little pathetic but in a way that doesn't make you curl up in pain.  Well done. Wish I had not read it.",positive
A chaotic tornado of characters.,negative
"I was expecting well drawn pictures to color but was very disappointed. If you're looking fro a true coloring book, keep looking...",negative
"I started this and it took a while to get into the story. I'm not sure if it was a busy time for me or not, but it was a slow start. It does pick up speed and once I got into it, I didn't want to stop. The story is about an odd friendship between a young woman and a teenage fortune teller in Atlantic City. There's a serial killer on the loose and the fortune teller starts seeing images of the victims. The characters were interesting, but most of them were not likeable. I wasn't satisfied with the ending, though it does seem to wrap things up for the most part.",positive
"Very good, but very expensive.<br />I should have looked more carefully at the number of ounces per bag.",positive
Not a very informative or interesting read,negative
"The Knight's Secret written by Jeffery Bardwell sadly isn't for me.  I find that the book really lacks a major plot and found that it sort of just drifts along. For the most part it's just rambling off Sir Corbin and whoever he is talking to. I am kind of missing the point of this story so far, but since I have no intention of picking up future books, reading this one was pretty much a waste of my time.<br /><br />The page of the book is slow and I mean SLOW. There were quite a few times I just glanced over the pages because the part was just dragging out too much.<br /><br />There was no particular character that was really worth mentioning that I felt somewhat connected to and that included Sir Corbin / Kelsa.<br /><br />There were no real twists or turns, no secrets that you are looking forward to be revealed, just nothing that I look forward to in a book sadly. There were a few editorial errors but nothing major.<br /><br />All in all this was just a very bland story that did nothing for me. Maybe the next one is better and is where all the action is but this one was not for me and I got one can not recommend it.",negative
high quality - good clear lines,positive
"I'm sorry but the best thing I can say about this is that it was free. I scanned the images and deleted it, didn't really get anything out of it.",negative
"I ordered this for my sixteen year old daughter. Because of her busy schedule, it took her a while to read it, but once she started it, she was reading it whenever she had a free moment. She absolutely loved it! She said it was very fast paced and exciting. It kept her guessing and she was completely surprised with who the murderer was at the end. There's reference to drug use - but it was steroid use and it was a minor theme in the book. As far as sexual content, there's mention of &#34;hooking up&#34;, but there's nothing beyond that. My daughter said it is very age appropriate for high school students, but not necessarily for middle school aged kids. It did remind her somewhat of Thirteen Reasons Why. The book wrapped up all of her questions, plus ones that she didn't even know she had. My daughter is hoping that the author writes a sequel.",positive
The artwork of these stickers aren’t great.,negative
"My husband is a small business owner and would like me to help out with the bookkeeping. I have very little bookkeeping experience and knowledge. This book is very comprehensive. The layout is good and there is lots of useful information. I especially like how detailed the table of contents is because it's made it very easy for me to locate sections that I have wanted to access. I started reading it like a regular book, but found jumping around as needed easier for me. It's written well and it doesn't seem to be talking down to me which I appreciate. I'm not ready to completely take over the books yet, but this has been helping me understand the vocabulary and overall procedures for helping my husband.",positive
"I bought this book for myself before Christmas, thinking about trying out the Paleo diet this year. The book is heavy and has many photos, recipes, etc.<br /><br />In fact, it has TOO MUCH STUFF. The text is very dense on the page, giving the eye no place to rest. The cartoons are cute. To a point. Overload is bad news because I just want to skip all the excessive text and can we just get to the dadgum recipes?!<br /><br />Also, I am not really concerned about her family. Her kids are cute, sure, but so what? It's worse than being pummeled with photos of my own family babies. Enough already!<br /><br />I returned it and got a copy of THE CASE AGAINST SUGAR.",negative
"A murder, a suspect, family plots and revenge.  A who done it novel that kept me guessing to the end!  A plot filled with colorful characters and so many interwoven connections that you really dont know who to trust!  I loved all the colorful characters in the novel, and in the last few chapters you wonder if the innocent is saved or not.  Events unravelled in second world war in France where three completely opposite characters merged that ended in killings that lead to a revenge and yet, who did it and how were kept hidden right to the end: was it the adopted brother, who was never loved once a natural born was conceived, the corporal, his wife, or someone from the past.  a great story teller and a great read for the beach or a very long commute!  Really enjoyed it the quaint British characters.",positive
"We received Bobby the Bunny instead of the shown Katy the Kitten. My granddaughter was disappointed, especially when we found out it was unavailable.",negative
"I am not sure how this earned such good reviews on here or on Goodread, as this story is hardly worth 4 stars. None of the main character are not particularly likeable and the main mystery is obvious half way thru, and as you read thru the details of what you already had figured out, you find yourself just pushing thru hoping the ending will explain the good reviews, only to find yourself disappointed and wondering if the general population just had bad taste",negative
"This is a fun throwback locked room mystery set in 1936 London.  Renowned psychiatrist Anselm Rees is found dead in his study.  The cast of characters includes his adult daughter who he trained in the field, her fiancé, the housekeeper, Detective Flint, Spector the conjurer, a variety of interesting walk-ons and Patients 1, 2 and 3, all successful in the arts.  There's an actress, a writer and a famed musician and the notes on their sessions reveal much.  Having been a fan in my earliest years of mystery ready of the classic authors to produced these confections, this had great characters and was well plotted.  A bit of magic and old fashioned police work save the day.",positive
I need to pay more attention when ordering.. Didn't know until it arrived was the smaller version.. But very nice thank u..,positive
"The book is well made and the photos are very nice.  It is a great guide from start to finish.  Lists tools and supplies needed.  I recommend this book.  The pages are thick, too.",positive
"Rising Hope was one of the very first cookbooks I purchased after returning from Japan, I saw it mentioned on several Facebook groups and the recipes sounded intriguing. What I wasn’t expecting was a beautifully illustrated book full of fantastic recipes, but even better are the stories of women whose lives have been changed by working at the bakery. They are trained to become bakers and find independence after escaping domestic violence and disadvantaged pasts.<br /><br />I have tried several of the bread recipes along with the kumquat rosemary marmalade, which is my new fave!<br /><br />Another great thing is that there are recipes that are gluten-free and vegan as well. i’ve enjoyed everything I have tried making so far and can’t wait to try additional recipes from this beautiful book!",positive
"Liked the book quite a bit. There were times it was slow and seemed to drag on, but all in all I really liked the book.",positive
My daughter needed a good resource to practice for the ACT test and this had several good practice tests to try,positive
"Got this book because it's the best one for teaching an undergrad math course for physical chemistry, which a colleague and I - fellow mathematician - will be doing in spring 2011. The chemistry students are looking forward to it; asked us to create the course.",positive
"I look forward to reading this book, however the print is incredibly small, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to read it at all.  I'm very disappointed, because I was hoping to learn more about the Titanic.",positive
"California Comeback<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars.....<br /><br />The author, Narda Zacchino, is well-qualified to analyze what is happening in California, both by growing up and having a long, distinguished journalism career in pCalifornia.<br /><br />And I, having lived in California since 1973, think she has done a fine job in concluding that this is not just a comeback, but as her subtitle states, a model for the nation.<br /><br />The book starts with the California Dream beginning with the 1849 Gold Rush and the hope for anyone striking instant wealth, but just be story until 1963 when CA overtook NY as the most populous state, signaling the Eastern elite better take notice. Governor Pat Brown, inspired by FDR's New Deal, basically had brought about a CA New Deal,<br /><br />Then CA turns Right, the Reagan Revolution, all leading up to the 2008 crash, where CA was ridiculed.<br /><br />Enter Jerry Brown, Pat's son, as governor in 2011. Having been governor from 1975 to 1983, plus having served in many positions like Secretary of State, Attorney General and Oakland mayor. Always socially liberal and fiscally conservative, plus with such experience, pragmatic, he set CA on a remarkable path, just passing France as the world's 6th largest economy and distancing itself from the previously heralded Texas model.<br /><br />The book covers many more details and history, such that I do recommend the book.",positive
"I was lured to read this novel by the setting, knowing very little about Mt. Vesuvius and the devastation it caused to the town of Pompeii.  That, I found very interesting.  I started losing believability in the characters as I was thrown back and forth between 79 AD and 1902.<br /><br />I realize that dialogue is very difficult when you create two living environments - but the disparity between the thoughts and speech in 79 AD and 1902 just didn’t ring true in either era.  It proved to be very distracting to this reader, as I fought with the impossibility of a young girl in 79 AD sounding just like Emily and Ivy in 1902.<br /><br />This was my first Lady Emily, and perhaps the author’s loyal fans can roll with this - I couldn’t, and frankly gave it up half way through.  I rarely stop reading a book, but this was not a comfortable read, and I couldn’t conjure up the determination to see it through to the end.<br /><br />I salute the author for the research she did to make the Pompeii scene very interesting and informative.  And  I salute her, too, for taking on a very difficult time swing in creating two separate tales -  and weaving them together.",negative
"I'll admit it, I am a connoisseur of organizing books. I have many, many organizing books. This book really didn't have more than your average organizing book. It has the same basic tips and steps to organize your life. This book is geared toward re-organizing your life after change- be it the birth of a child, a divorce, a new job, a move, whatever. I think that is a great approach to organizing. We often need to stop, rethink our schedules, priorities, and homes and adjust them to fit our growing and changing lives. These transition times provide an excellent opportunity to do just that. Even if you aren't experiencing some huge life change, this book can help you get organized.<br /><br />I like the compact size of this book. It makes it easy to stuff in your bag and read while you're out and about. (That is something I do quite often.) Most organization books are a really awkward size. The pages in this book are glossy and full color, which was just weird for me in this book size. But I liked the full color photos.<br /><br />If you've got other organizing books, you probably won't find anything new here. If you're new to organizing books, this book is a good place to start. Great lists, tips, tricks, and steps to get your life organized.",positive
I'll stick with his fiction,negative
great book,positive
"We are getting ready to take a trip around the USA in our retirement. This investment seems like a no brainer.  This book has lots of pictures and great ideas.  It will be fun to explore the options.  We also invested in an atlas - even though we all use google to get around, it's fun to look at a map you can touch - yes- because we are baby boomers.",positive
This is a great guide every cat owner should have.,positive
"This story starts with a strange gladiatorial fight, but then jumps to a class of girls being trained up to join the Mystical Slayers.  There are hints that the world is under a one company order, but the explanations made no economic sense.  (not a huge surprise as most of the anti-corporate stories lack a real understanding of how business works, and this story had clear anti-corporate plot threads.)<br /><br />And that resulted in a world that I'm not sure the author had defined in his mind.  Honestly, I couldn't get the characters because the whole plot felt like it was just floating away from the shore on a rip current.  It hadn't been given a foundation to tie the plot to something.  I had little to no clue what the first fight was about, and then we jumped in time and space without an explanation or any idea of what the fight was about, for, or who won.<br /><br />I can't even say that the idea was good.  I just couldn't find it in the way the story flailed around.",negative
Good read. Likeable interesting characters. New author to me and I really enjoyed reading this.,positive
It should clearly state not a workbook but lesson idea and plans for kids,negative
"I think Rosemary Mosco is one of the most creative and clever people I've come across. She is funny, but more importantly has a way of educating that makes those of us who follow her work remember what we've learned from her. This book is no different. The illustrations are great as well. Anyone who cares about or loves nature will love this fun and educational book!",positive
Great book for the cost,positive
Very poorly printed. Can't really comment on the content because the colors and resolution of the pictures were so poor. Looked like something you might find in a flea market circa 1962. Back it goes.,negative
Don't recommend.,negative
Cute Christmas book. Took off a star because I think for a board book I would have preferred more basic words and the action and emotion words seem confusing to me. But overall it is a very nice holiday book with lots to look at and nice illustrations.,positive
"I know Dan Jenkins is a coveted sports writer but man, can he ease up on the ""n"" word. I'm a golfer but I was turned off by it. Watch the HBO movie version. They substitute the ""n"" word with ""ethnics"" which is (sigh) obvious. In my opinion, Randy Quaid has the best golf swing for an actor. And there's a good nude scene by Corinne Bohrer.",negative
👍👍,positive
Ok.<br />I was an NHL fan back from the 1970s & 80's- Grapes was very vague & not chronological with the book.<br />The Canadian movie made about Grapes was awesome!<br />This book- not worth it!,negative
"This is a sweet story, but a bit too perfect. Real life has more flaws. I liked the characters well enough. I liked how the whole subject of sex was dealt with. As a mother of a teenage girl, I thought that was handled very well. It's a good example, even though it may be unrealistic. It is a fast paced book and easy to read. I was a huge fan of &#34;Forever&#34; by Judy Blume when I was a teen. I wouldn't go as far as to say this is the new &#34;Forever&#34;, but it does have some general similarities. Overall, I did like it, but I think it could have been better.",positive
"I purchased this because I was in the midst of preparing a college paper on Twain's use of religion and superstition in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but it not only was not what I expected, it ended up being of no use. I gained no insight into what Twain might have thought or felt at the time of writing Huck Finn because these were works from later in his life -- from a darker, more depressed state of mind. I could not even find enjoyment in reading it outside of the need created by the paper I was writing; this was not the Twain with whom I was familiar. A darker, more hopeless author conceived these pieces, and I found his state of mind entirely depressing.",negative
The concept described in a very boring way. Just don't like it.,negative
"A bland story. No excitement, nothing drew me in. By the way, is there really somewhere called “Buttermilk Falls”? The name was annoying.",negative
I have wanted this book for years and finally was able to purchase it. I was very disappointed because the title does not describe the book in my minds eye. I thought I would be seeing some really outstanding and different gardens to give me some inspiration for my own gardens. Instead I was bored to death. Gave it away.,negative
"I was drawn to &#34;Reading with Patrick&#34; because I love books about teaching and the impact teachers can have on students.  Michelle Kuo, a recent graduate of an Ivy League school, is a bit undecided about what to do with her life.  She decides to sign up for Teach for America and is assigned to an impoverished school in Helena, Arkansas.  She is young and idealistic, and at first the students are challenging in a way that she could never have anticipated.  She persists, however, and through herculean effort makes an impression on many of them.<br /><br />Encouraged by her family and friends to go to law school rather than &#34;waste&#34; he talents and her Ivy League education on teaching, she takes the LSAT and is admitted, but then decides to teach for one more year.  She meets Patrick, a promising, intelligent, and sensitive student, and has her greatest success with him.  Later, upon graduating from law school, she gets a letter from Patrick, who is unfortunately awaiting trial for murder.  She returns to Helena, and they begin a close relationship through the seven months he is waiting for trial.  They connect through literature, and Patrick finds a way to express himself through poetry.  Michelle, too, grows through her friendship with Patrick.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parts of this book that dealt with literature and how Michelle was able to relate it to Patrick's life.  Less successful, in my opinion, was the exploration of Michelle's own growth and maturity.  However, I recommend this book for those who like books about personal growth and literature, and how literature can help us see truth and make sense of our world.  The book is easy to read and has many lovely moments that the reader will appreciate.",positive
"I ordered this book because I recently purchased a Ninja Foodi and it has an air fryer option besides being a pressure cooker, dehydrator, and slow cooker.<br /><br />This text is thin but has a good overview on the best air fryers to buy and why they like a particular type of air fryer. It does not mention the Ninja Foodi at all. There are about 13 recipes in this cookbook that I would make.  For this review, I decided to make the big Italian meatballs with zucchini noodles. It came out delicious and the prepared dish is shown in the last photo.<br /><br />However, as I started to cook the meatballs, I realized the Foodi does not go lower than 300 degrees for the air fryer option. The recipe calls for 250 degrees. I did keep checking the meatballs during cooking. Unfortunately, I overcooked them just little bit on the last cycle that called for 160 degrees. They just came out a tiny bit dryer than they should have. Nevertheless, I was more successful with cooking the zucchini noodles since that required 400 degrees. The end result was delicious.<br /><br />Note that the recipe called for salt and pepper but the amount of those two ingredients were listed in the text instead of the recipe so one has to be careful to read everything first.<br /><br />In summary, this is a good air fryer recipe book. However, it is not written for someone who has a Ninja Foodi because the temperatures on the Foodi do not go as low as some of the recipes call for. Of course, one can make adjustments and keep watch over the cooking cycles to approximate the necessary cooking times in this situation.",positive
"I own numerous Italian-themed dessert and baking books, and was intrigued to try ""Authentic Italian Desserts: 75 Traditional Favorites Made Easy."" True to the book's title, the included cakes, cookies, tarts, and other desserts are easy to make with common pantry ingredients. I loved some of the quick breads (called plum cakes here) using fruits, yogurt, and olive oil. The amount of sugar was also less than many American recipes and reminded me of the baked goods my Polish grandmother used to make. I've really enjoyed the recipes I've tried so far (including the apple and cinnamon bread) and look forward to baking my way through this over the coming months!",positive
"What should have been a terrific coffee table style reference book is reduced to a semi untrustworthy picture book. I wanted to give this to my husband for his collection and I was a little embarrassed to realized that there are number of errors throughout this book. Some of the photos are mislabeled, some of the information is actually factually incorrect and it's just unfortunate that this was allowed to go to print and to sale in the first place. I am giving it two stars for the photos of the antiques weapons that are correct and hard to come by.",negative
"Great book if you have tons of time, money and some sort of proffesional training. Concept is good.",negative
"Before I started reading this, I read some of the other reviews for it. And to be honest, I got a little worried. However, I went ahead with the reading. I didn't stop until it was finished, later the same day. I am pleased to report that I really enjoyed it! While I didn't love it, I did like it, a lot. The story is about a young single woman. She's a programmer and works for a tech company. One day, she gets a package, which turns out to be the ashes of her dead husband. This comes as a surprised to everyone in her daily life because no one knew she had even been married. She has to revisit feelings of grief. While there was some sad situations, it isn't a sad story. It moves along pretty well. I would definitely classify this as a chick-lit rather than a romance.",positive
Great book for the cost,positive
It ended too soon,negative
"The author looks at how work has been de-humanized to the point of,being just part of a society structured around, as he calls it, computational capitalism, a system where consumer consumption is the measure of success. And, we are ruled by &#34;algorithmic govermentality.&#34;<br /><br />Sure, automation has lead to less needed human work hours, and there is dignity to hard work, be it manual or intellectual. But, this is the way progress happens. The world is the healthiest (longest life expectancy), most educated, etc. By the way, video games require higher order thinking than reading (parallel vs sequential thinking). Not that one replaces the other, just that most everyone's brain is more capable of the creative and critical thinking the author thinks has been lost.<br /><br />Bottom line, although a worthy subject to analyze, I think this book is misguided AND masked with words so pedantic, one needs a dictionary to read almost every page.",negative
"This National Geographic book titled Octopus, Seahorse, Jellyfish is a beautiful book. It is broken into the 3 sections, one for each of the animals. There are a few pages of information and diagrams, then the rest of the sections are filled with photos. Some of the  photos are labeled with the specific name/type of the animal as well as the details about size and location. It would make a lovely coffee table book.",positive
"The artwork is nice, but there are 2 bookmarks per page and they are tear apart.  I don't think that this is acceptable for a bookmark.<br /><br />Plus, they are kind of short for a bookmark (only 5 3/4 inches, I should have paid more attention when ordering).<br /><br />The list price is $1.50, so not a bargain here.  It is currently on a 4 for 3 deal which helps if you like short, tear apart bookmarks...",negative
The entire notebook is floppy.  It’s not a hard cover like a marble notebook has,negative
Very disappointing,negative
"As a Dan Brown novel, Origin is just okay, certainly no Da Vinci Code.  As one reviewer noted, the novel felt ""unauthentic,""  and for several reasons I agree.  It did not have the same flow as other Dan Brown novels.  And most of the plot elements seem to be pulled directly from the news of the past few years, not particularly original.  But for a novel written mostly by artificial intelligence (AI), if it was, it's not bad as a mass-produced Turing test.",negative
The colorful pages and decorative text is fun to look at and beautifully created. The My Travel Friends Series are wonderful books that my whole family love. There are 37 gorgeous pages and beautiful illustrations! Recycling and keeping our water clean is a story I love to read to my kids. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs!,positive
"This is a nice, comprehensive guidebook of Lisbon. I had the opportunity to go to Lisbon about 25 years ago and I would love to go back one day. The layout of the book is good and is primarily broken down into various neighborhoods. There are colorful maps with contemporary fonts that look like modern book covers (such as John Green's books). While I do appreciate different fonts, I did find the map a little difficult to read because of it.  There are a few, small color photos. The book includes the usual sections such as where to stay and dine and as well as the ""worth the trip"" blurbs which I found interesting. There's a fold out map in the back.

"The better written of the two battling bios, although as other reviewers have noted, marred by some sloppy editing.  Much as I've always admired Neil Young's work, I have to agree with David Browne's underlying premise that his addition to the CSN mother-ship ultimately brought the ship down.  To my ears, the first album (Crosby, Stills and Nash) was near perfection; with album number two (Deja Vu) the seeds of destruction were sown.  Stills' confidence undermined by the addition of his musical brother Young; Crosby slipping deeper and deeper into his drug-induced haze; Nash unsuccessfully taking on the role of peacemaking middle child, and Young's ego being fed even as he's selfishly using the band to jump start his own solo career.  Nash's Wasted On The Way tells the tale, truly.  So many false starts, abandoned albums, unattained dreams and lost friendships.  CSNY plays out like a Greek tragedy in modern times.  Lost boys with fatal flaws who occasionally touched greatness, then immediately threw it all away.  We should be thankful for those great moments.",positive
"If I have to read another book about Carrie, wait..I won't read another book about Carrie.  I loved the Kay Scarpitta series and how it developed.  I read every one of them in order.  Then Carrie came back and is shoved down our throats. Even I could write a book if I developed a character who could be anywhere undetected anytime and who knew where everyone else was all the time. The characters are getting stuck on hold with no development or growth except when they are with Desi.  Lucy is a great character when she gets to do something.  Benton has little personality anymore.  We are stuck in two houses for 24 hours with a lot of repetition.  Also, did I miss something?  Didn't the last book leave us hanging in Florida with Kay and Benton drinking wine when &#34;Snap&#34; was the last word?  I remember the reviews from everyone after that book: &#34;  Oh no, I can't wait to find out what happened.&#34;  Well, what happened?",negative
"This is a collection of empowering women's short stories. It's an easy book to pick up and read. The stories are entertaining and quick to read. Many of them are mystical/fantasy stories. As with all collections such as this, there were some that I liked and some that I didn't. It is definitely a creative selection of stories.",positive
"Very, very good.  ""Rusty Gear"" is a fine, engaging storyteller.  Written in an easygoing, conversational tone and style with Ashley Wren Collins, Russ Giguere recounts his  -- and The Association's -- history in detail, without coming across like a kiss-and-tell-all type.  He extolls his band's musical artistry (one of the all-time great harmony groups),  while also defending its up-and-down history (questionable singles choices, managerial highs and lows) ; in addition, he questions its lack of reputation (first folk-rockers, for example, and opening act performers at the legendary 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), and makes a solid case for the band's (long denied) inclusion into the R 'n' R Hall of Fame.  It reads like a reunion memory-fest evening over drinks with a long-lost old friend.  Good stuff, indeed; thanks, Russ, for the memories and the music.",positive
"This is the third and final book in Jim & Rachel Britts' awesome TO SAVE A LIFE series. The challenges that Jake and Amy face are real-life issues as they approach their college graduations and try to discern God's will for their lives. Will they be together? Will Jake become a big NBA star? Or does God have other plans for them? As in real life: you're either all in or not! A fitting ending to one of the best Christian novel series out there. My daughter Elizabeth (whom I discuss in my reviews of TO SAVE A LIFE and JAKE'S CHOICE) loved TO SAVE A LIFE! She really would have enjoyed JAKE'S CHOICE and especially, ALL OR NOTHING. My only hope is that the last two books will be made into a movie!",positive

"Terry Goodkind’s nonsensical preaching is nauseating. To quote... the most ridiculous thing I have yet to hear Goodkind write...'Appearance, was a reflection of what a person thought of themselves...and therefore by extension, of others. A person crippled by self loathing or self doubt reflected those feelings in their appearance'<br />What nonsense! I so regret buying this idiot's books. What a waste of time. I certainly worry about what I am wearing because I want other to understand, BY EXTENSION, what my choice of attire means I think of them.... With each book Terry Goodkind writes, his belief in his own knowledge and Godlike understanding, grows beyond even the limits of fiction...",negative
"An Uncommon Honeymoon is another fun book in the Librarian Spy series by Susan Mann. I have read all three of the books in the series and they are all fast paced, exciting romances. My favorite is the first one, but this one is still enjoyable. The plot reminds me of the Mission Impossible movies with the addition of romance. The heroine in the series is a beautiful librarian, Quinn, who falls in love with a spy, James. This third one coincides with their honeymoon. They chase after drug smugglers and human traffickers. The chemistry between Quinn and James is amazing. There's some steamy romance and plenty of spy action. I really enjoyed all of the library tidbits and facts that flow throughout the series. I hope that there's another title in the series in the future.",positive
"Purchased for my husband for Christmas.... he has always wanted to build a wooden boat.  He loves that this one has some actual plans that are good to consider as a beginner.  He notes that you'll probably need a couple of different books to compare and gather info, but this one is an excellent one to start with.  I would consider that a 5 star review from him. I always update if there is anything important to report.  I will say the book arrived with a folded corner and not &#34;packed&#34; in any way, along with other items I had ordered.  That part was a little disappointing.",positive
"Extremely disappointing on all levels.  Absolutely no romance or relationship involved in story.  Time travel is almost irrelevant.  Huge question of how one character traveled into future & never even knew it.<br /><br />Even as a mystery, weak is best description.  Most accurate label would be historical time piece.<br /><br />And, what is the point of the constant fist clenching mentioned in earlier review?  Oh & just flat out boring.",negative
"One thing I really like about this Keto Cocktail cookbook is that there are lots of recipes to choose from. The recipes are divided by alcohol type, such as vodka. This makes it easy to find a recipes for the items you have on hand. Nutritional information is provided for each recipe. There's also a section on snacks/desserts in the back so this one book can be your go-to planning for entertaining while following a Keto diet. My only criticism of the book is that there are no photos of the recipes inside. Each chapter starts off with a photo of a drink from that chapter, but that's it.",positive
I couldn't even get past the sample chapter's desperate FBI agent falling all over her target. The story was so slow I quit and didn't even purchase to finish not worth it he time.,negative
"I'm a fairly fast reader, especially if the book is well-written and holds my interest.<br /><br />It took me almost 6 months to finish this book.  It was VERY tough going.  I really wanted to like it, and I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did.<br /><br />A handful of the many problems:<br /><br />1.  The main character just isn't likable.  At all.  She's annoying, and the author has made her even more so by specifically laying out her southern accent (albeit inconsistently).  Frankly, by about 1/3 of the way through the book, I just didn't care any more about her.<br /><br />2.  The story jumps around like a frog on speed.  Just when I think I understand where we are, we shoot off in a totally different direction.  That's bad enough, but then we never return to finish what we started in the first place.  I HATE that.<br /><br />3.  The recipes are decent, some actually quite good, but they're no better nor worse than you would find in a good cookbook.  In other words, don't buy this just for the recipes.<br /><br />4.  The main character just isn't all that believable.  If she's so smart, how come she makes so many bad choices?<br /><br />I think this was a good idea, but the end result doesn't live up to the potential.",negative

Bought it as a gift, but I am really thankful I didn't give it away.  The resulting pins just make me sad, and they look really rudimentary.  Expected more and better than I got.",negative
"The product is too cheap to worth confront with usps for compensation.<br />Buy at your own risk, I never received the package.",negative
"I don't know if the author did this on purpose to try and get double the sales, but you can't use this book without buyer her other book that identifies the ingredients. I find that really annoying. It would be an easy thing to include a simple picture or diagram  of the plants used in the recipes, so that you could go out and harvest them. But no, there is no pictures or descriptions of the plants you need. You have to get her other book for that. Sure, you could maybe look it up on the internet, but that is beside the point. The point is that this book is only useful to people who already know the plants and where to find them. It is incomplete for everyone else.",negative
"My wife loves Kate Quinn's novels, The Rose Code is no exception.  Kept her interest to the point that she read it through in two days, two sittings each.  She has since re-read it and enjoyed it all over again.  One of her favorites.  Definitely recommended.",positive
"I just could not finish this book. I have tried several times over the past few months; picking up where I left off, restarting from the beginning. I can't do it.<br />I just can't seem to care what happens to any of the characters. Nicholas Close sees dead people. Been there done that. There's been movies, TV series and a sea of novels with the same themes and concepts. When Nicholas mentions his 'ability' to others, even close friends, they pull away thinking he's crazy or desperate for attention. Oddly this doesn't seem to happen this way in real life. Start talking about the occult or the paranormal and at least in my circles people come running to share their experiences.<br />Fleeing a horrible death, which he sees over and over, Nicholas returns to his childhood home seeking safety and stability (another overdone concept all too common in everything from fantasy to Harlequin Romances). Only to find that nowhere is safe.<br />Nicholas' family is just as messed up as he is and brings nothing to the table to care about. It just feels all to done before and for the most part done better elsewhere.<br />I can't recommend this book.",negative
"In this series,this book is the one with the most intriguing situations.

I really enjoyed this story,and what Sailor is becoming to Lily. I highly recommend this book !",positive
"If you are diabetic, beware:  the sheer amount of sugary love this author has for GAC is astronomical.

"This is a short story (based on truth) about two young Alaskan native under-aged girls (Millie and Maura) who lost their family to the plague that was brought to them by the white man during the gold rush era. The entire story is based on the girls venturing out to find civilization after everyone in their village and surrounding villages had died. It's a fast-paced story that is deeply engrossing and can be read in several hours. I loved the narrative and that it is based on fact. However, there are two disappointments I have.<br /><br />First, I would have loved if the book provided a background history on the great death in an introduction. Reading this story without having read the review on the back jacket cover, I would not have even known it was anything but fiction. One of the reviewers of this book provided a great background synopsis on the plague and the author which should have been in the book.<br /><br />Second, I felt like the ending was cut short. I would have liked the story to continue so that it is not left up to the imagination as to what happened to the girls. Again another synopsis saying how the girls lived their life would have been preferred which could have easily been written into an epilogue of the book.<br /><br />Overall this is a very enjoyable read. I purchased it at book outlet on a whim for $5.99 plus shipping.",positive
"I found The Everything Girl to be a captivating read. I actually enjoyed it more than The Devil Wears Prada that it has been compared to. There were a couple of characters that I actually liked, but most of them were unlikeable. The chapters are not too long which is important to me. I don't always have a lot of time to read, so I want to be able to pick up a book and come to a stopping point, like the end of a chapter, rather than stopping mid-chapter. The book is well written and fast paced. It says that real-life drama inspired the story which is horrifying to learn that there are real bosses out there like that. It was an entertaining and fun read.",positive
"To be honest, I listened to the audiobook based purely on Jack Edward's video review after he read it. I really wasn't certain what to expect and was pleasantly blown away.<br /><br />First, let me say that Ms. July has a wonderful handle on the art of prose writing and paints hauntingly real depictions of the way people perceive themselves and the world.<br /><br />Secondly, these stories are mostly told from the perspective of alienated souls and social black sheep. They are intense, human stories about love and sexuality and loss and being used and yet there are glimmers of hope and salvation mixed in to sustain you.<br /><br />This a book you will definitely return to reread several times over in a lifetime.",positive
"I was so excited to see this months back.  I was tempted to pre-order it but at $22 dollars it was a bit out of my budget.  It came down to $17 with a coupon that made it $15.50 so I grabbed it.  I just received it.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  This is 1/3 of the size of her other books!!!!  The paper quality does not seem as good at the two previous books.  I have no problem with the book being 1/3 the previous books if the price reflects that.  It does not.  This book is more expensive than the other books!!!  I feel this is a gimmick.  I think the publisher knew we would automatically buy this book, not realizing it was only 1/3 of the first two books.  I didn't even look at the book.  I will be sending it back and not buying any more books from Dana Fox.  Complete rip off of loyal fans!",negative
"I am in love with this book!<br /><br />I laughed so hard at times that I cried, snorted and all the sorts of things that get you stared at when reading in public. As an 80’s baby, I grew up watching all the movies and listening to all the cheesy music that was referenced in this book which not only made it nostalgic, but made it feel like I was hanging out with old friends.<br /><br />As with all of Lauren Blakley’s books they are smart, funny, punchy and saucy. Unzipped by far is one of my favourites, although I say that about all of her books. I loved it so much I also got it on Audible which really brought it to life after reading the book and I highly recommend. The narrators do an amazing job and at only 6 hours long it is easy listening!<br /><br />If you have never read any of Lauren Blakely’s books before then you need to…stat, and this may be the perfect one to start you off.",positive

"I was really expecting a more involved book and projects, but this shows how you can use the ideas of screen printing on a quick and easy level.  These are not four color photos transfers, they are simple sihlouettes that are simple and elegant.  You don't need a huge screen printing set up, just a small screen and a cut out stencil.  It is actually pretty impressive in its simplicity to make projects with minimal supplies. Would make a perfect art gift with a couple inks, a screen and a squeegee.  Very nice little book.",positive

"This was a quick read. Although flawed in many ways, I found it to be entertaining. I didn't really like any of the characters. The plot was familiar and reminiscent of old-school thriller/horror movies. A lot of it was predictable, but there were a few twists that surprised me. In the end, I was entertained and liked it.",positive
"This is at most a nice book for beginners who have no real interest in performing analyses.  I can't understand the previous recommendation or how anybody could be hired to work professionally with Excel based on the meager knowledge that this book imparts.  There are only five pages on Pivot Tables, one of the most crucial topics to be covered.  Not only are macros not mentioned in the table of contents - they aren't even mentioned in the complete (for this book) index.  This is no more than an introduction to Excel 2007.  Granted it's a nicely done introduction, but it's at most a book which could be used as the basis for a half-semester class in Junior High School.  The second star was because the meager contents are well presented.  Anybody who wants to really comprehend what is in Excel 2007 which is an excellent step up from its predecessors, better look somewhere else.",negative

Dr. Mackie McKay is the accused in his wife's murder and is actively looking for the truth.  Intertwined with the quest to find the real killer, McKay is swept up in the corrupt world of synthetic blood production, adding to the intrigue of this tremendous book.<br /><br />Overall, Blood Money is a tremendous read.

"I LOVED the previous two books in this series.  They were beautiful designed and published and great fun to complete. The third book is a disappointment.  The book is half the size of the previous books at the same price.  The topic could have been explored more.  There are fruits to paint!  Papaya, coconut, pineapple,  and figs in very simplistic shapes.  They could have at least been presented hanging on their plants or with leaves!  Where is the giraffe? I preordered this book as soon as it appeared on Amazon and was waiting with great anticipation for it to arrive.  I was surprised at the decrease in quality.  I think that Dana Fox is such a talented artist and her first too books wonderful. I had hoped for more.  For some reason, this book does not meet the standards previously presented.",negative

"Usually I'm a bit suspicious of any book that claims desserts with quick prep times, expecting them to rely heavily on packaged and chemical-laden shortcuts.<br /><br />So I was very pleasantly surprised by ""The Weeknight Dessert Cookbook"" by Mary Younkin.<br /><br />Containing 80 recipes for puddings, refrigerator pies, bars, cookies, and cakes, you'll find a diverse collection of classics like pound cake and chocolate chip cookies mixed in with treats like black forest bars, chocolate blueberry brownies, cranberry lemon scone cookies, and chocolate caramel pecan pound cake.<br /><br />There are no boxed mixes here, everything is whipped up from scratch (note that the 5-15 minutes refers only to the prep; the baking still takes normal time).<br /><br />As a single household, I also loved that many of the cakes and desserts are geared towards 1-5 servings in many cases, meaning no need to halve the recipe or have too many leftovers (most of these treats freeze well if so).<br /><br />Measurements / temperatures are given in US as well as metric.<br /><br />I look forward to purchasing Ms. Younkin's ""Weeknight Dinners"" and ""Weekday Lunches and Breakfasts"" on the strength of this title; if you enjoy baking but are in a crunch for time, this will become your new best friend to get delicious desserts on the table that the whole family will enjoy!",positive

There are some vegan recipes, too, but I would say that most of them are not vegan. Most of the ingredients are pretty standard and are things we have at home. There are some that will require a trip to the store. The layout of the book is quite nice. It is broken down into categories. Nutritional information is provided. The only photos in the book are at the beginning of each chapter. My daughter has already tried a couple of recipes and so far, she's been pleased with them.",positive

"I purchased both the ([[ASIN:0981994644 More Chat Pack Cards: New Questions to Spark Fun Conversations]] (this set) and the [[ASIN:0975580167 Chat Pack: Fun Questions to Spark Conversations]] to add variety to my vacation time with my boyfriend. Both he and I liked how these cards stimulated discussions and allowed us to think and get to know details about each other that we did not know even though we have been together for 15 years.<br /><br />Each card is the size of a tiny Post-It note at 1 inch x 3-1/2 inches. In this package are questions such as:<br /><br />- From computers to cars, cell phones to TV remote controls... Of all the things you use that have buttons on them, what is your favorite button to push?<br />- If you came with a guarantee--like so many products do--what could you honestly guarantee about yourself?<br />- If you could receive as a gift one piece of jewelry--regardless of cost--what would you want it to be?<br /><br />Some questions made us think on the fly and make stuff up. This means that if we were answering this question again, we would give a different answer because we never actually thought about that particular question. There are some questions that were difficult to answer. For instance, I do not watch TV or movies much so I could not answer any questions related to the best movie sequel because I did not know any. One is encouraged to change up the questions if necessary.<br /><br />Overall, we found this both fun and entertaining and only got though part of each pack.

"I give this book one star because I can't give less. This book has poorly written instructions, and the projects are copies of other people's designs, mostly from the 1980's and 1990's.

She is not a designer, and this poorly written &#34;instruction&#34; book testifies to this fact.",negative
The premise was very good and that is the only reason I made it to 26% before quitting in frustration. The writing was very stunted. Think high school creative writing class.

Sometimes it's mildly enjoyable or marginally informative.<br /><br />After today's copy I'll never listen to it again. Every, and I mean every story narrated for the whole length of the audible was about Trump or detailed unrelated news in regard to its relationship to Trump or just mentioned Trump somewhere in the article regardless of the subject. I literally couldn't believe it as I continued to listen.<br /><br />This same phenomena has saturated all news outlets from The New York Times to The Wall Street Journal. I already don't bother with video news media and YouTube postings.<br /><br />Trump is not that interesting. I don't care what he thinks about snowflakes or yogurt or other individuals.<br /><br />At worst this is yellow journalism, at best it's simply lazy. There is no real news anymore among the major venues. There are silly stories made up by silly writers who only consider ratings as they insert Trump and other  keywords as they formulate the hot topic of the day. It's made-up.",negative
"This is a gripping story that keeps you reading to the end. It does start out slowly though, and had me wondering what I was getting into. Many of the chapters are on the long side, which don't work well for reading in small chunks, so I had to make time to read it. The book tells the story of 4 women and the payback to wealthy man who often seemed above the law who had hurt them at one time or another. The women's relationships to one another was well written. The events weren't far fetched which made them believable. Overall, I found it well worth my time reading it.",positive

"This book is about an average high school guy who does the minimum to get by. It's an interesting and entertaining story that gave a perspective of an often overlooked character. While I didn't personally connect with any of the characters, they were well developed. The book deals with topics such as drug dealing and cancer. The author does a great job with the relationships in the story. Overall, it's a good read.",positive
"I've reviewed several Classic Starts having read at least a half dozen with my kindergarten age boys.  I have to write this is a very poor retelling.  I really enjoyed a few of the Classic Starts but this one is not the only Classic Start that is woefully done.  Never a substitute for the real thing, I still thought Pinocchio, Tom Sawyer and Call of the Wild were decently retold.  Moby Dick, The Jungle Book and Treasure Island were bearable.  But 20,000 Leagues was so boring.  This is not a commentary or opinion on the Jules Verne original -- a great story.  It's just this retelling of it is so mechanically narrated with none of the character's internal muse.  Another one that is almost unbearable is Swiss Family Robinson.  I suppose the original texts just don't lend themselves to simplification.",negative

"My daughter is a junior in high school, so this is the year she will be taking the SAT. This book will be very helpful as she prepares for the test. It's broken into different subject categories. There are several example questions. I was especially impressed with the answer portion because it doesn't just give the correct answer, it gives tips and reasoning for why the answer is correct. I remember having buying an SAT review book back in the 1985. The answers were provided, but that's all. There was no explanations given to help you understand the answer. Plus, my review book was basically just a practice test. My daughter has taken the PSAT once a year since 8th grade, so she's gotten practice taking the test. I think having access to a variety of practice questions and being able to understand why an answer is wrong or right is more helpful to her at this time. The way the book is laid out, I think it would be easy to do it in chunks as your time allows. Overall, I think this is a great tool for test preparation.",positive

"I liked author Julia Heaberlin’s previous novel, [[ASIN:0804178011 Black-Eyed Susans]], a lot, but didn’t care at all for PAPER GHOSTS: A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE. The basic premise—a young woman locates her sister’s probable killer, who is suffering from dementia, and obtains his release from a care home for a 10-day, 2-person auto trip across Texas, so she can extract his confession—is simply too bizarre and unbelievable.<br /><br />This is a first-person narrative, and if you don’t buy into the premise, then the strange young woman isn’t likeable enough to sustain interest in her curious machinations. She has designed little tests, involving photographs and objects (e.g., a scarf similar to a murder victim’s), that she hopes will reawaken the still-dangerous serial killer’s lost memories.  Their effectiveness is limited by the killer’s unexpected lucidity.  Has he been feigning his dementia?<br /><br />The parts of the narrative that describe the young woman’s sister, the sisters’ relationship, and the Branch Davidian debacle at Waco are poignant and well-done.  However, this doesn’t make up for the incredible plot premise, and the equally incredible, unsatisfying, surprise ending.",negative

"Breton composer Yann Tiersen's haunting, poignant score to the French film ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain"" is full of childhood nostalgia such as toy piano and typewriter tempered with more melancholy piano musings worthy of Chopin or Satie. In ""Six Pieces pour Piano,"" six of Amelie's most memorable themes are included, including Le Moulin (The Windmill), La Dispute (The Argument), Sur le fil (On the Wire), La Valse d'Amelie (Amelie's Waltz), and two of Tiersen's Comptine d'ete. The sheet music is very close in spirit to the original OST, and I would venture a guess that the level would be around high intermediate. Many of the pieces I learned quickly and use as a way to unwind at the end of a day; some are perfectly suited to slow, rainy days, such as the raindrop-like melody of Le Moulin. Others, such as Amelie's Waltz, are infectiously (and romantically) good-natured. This is a French folio (I tracked down my copy while visiting Paris in 2002), so it is pricey, but well worth the cost if you're looking for something new to expand your repertoire.",positive
"The plot of THE CHILL: A NOVEL sounds promising--it’s about a huge reservoir that is haunted by the remnants of Galesburg, a community that was drowned when the reservoir’s dam was built to deliver water to downstate New York.  Unfortunately, the novel is almost unreadable.  Whatever story exists is buried under the sheer weight of words expended to establish an ominous atmosphere by describing minute details of a dilapidated cabin, underground NYC sewers, the reservoir’s cold currents, etc.<br /><br />By the end of Part One (about 100 of 435 pages), almost nothing has happened.  A grandmother who once lived in Galesburg “goes home” by drowning herself in the reservoir, using weighted and padlocked chains.  A New York City sewer worker starts seeing Galesburg-related hallucinations in the nearly complete water tunnel he is building.  A local sheriff kicks his drug-addicted son out of his home, telling the son he is no longer fit enough to swim the reservoir.  The son goes swimming in the reservoir, and hallucinates killing a dam inspector who has just discovered a condition that will lead to the dam’s failure.  The sewer worker’s daughter (and granddaughter of the drowned grandmother) arrives to investigate the son’s story, and realizes something is horribly wrong when the son mentions the name of a photographer who might have witnessed the killing.<br /><br />At this point, I gave up.  It’s clear that something very bad is going to happen at the reservoir, but I don’t care.  The characters aren’t memorable or well developed, and the puzzle of how Galesburg is going to get its revenge is only mildly interesting.  I certainly don’t want to read another 300 pages of overly descriptive prose to find out what happens next in the very thin overall story.",negative
"My family has  considering going to Costa Rica for our summer vacation this year. I wasn't very excited about that destination. That is, I wasn't very excited until I started reading through this guide book! Now, I am super excited and hope that this becomes our destination!!

The only criticism of the book is the pages and cover are light weight and flimsy. Other than that, it's a great introduction to the country.",positive
"Although there are numerous young adult novels that deal with WWII, I've run across few that deal with the horrors of WWI in such intimate detail. Thirteen-year-old Annie's father is a doctor, and she's waiting for him at the train station when she sees wounded soldiers being unloaded from the train: victims of mustard gas, shrapnel wounds, and other war injuries. This reality brings the war home for her in a way that simply reading about it in the papers couldn't.<br /><br />Soon, Annie begins to spend time with the wounded soldiers at the veteran's hospital where her father works. Anne befriends a soldier wounded in a mustard gas attack and experiences the first stirrings of romance and adult responsibilities. Her initial revulsion at the wounded soldiers' appearances is believable as she has been sheltered from the realities of war by her mother, and her gradual infatuation with Andrew tenderly unfolds.<br /><br />Overall, this was an inspiring novel that explored heroism, the meaning of sacrifice, and the high cost of war on all involved. I read this numerous times as a teenager, and recently purchased a copy in order to reacquaint myself with Annie's courage and the moving descriptions of patriotism and heroism.",positive

"fabulous book for beginners who wants to combine the practice with the theory.  There are details of posses to work on the eight chakras that the title is based on.

"Who knew chicken tika masala, and rogan josh come from the UK!  And we loved some of the recipes thus far and they have been winnners!  A curry from Japan was delicious and the sauce was made from vegetables!  Like all good recipes, authentic ones, will take a little prep time and the extra ingredients, and it is worth it.  All the ingredients, thus far, have been easy to buy in the large supermarkets.  So not for those who wants to turn around a dish in less than an hour, but if you want to learn to make Greta curries, put some time aside and enjoy the smiles. The curries are not typical curries you see in restaurants (except for those in the UK section).<br /><br />Thank goodness this book was available from sellers in Amazon!  Thank you!!!",positive
"My four year old son immediately fell in love with Awesome Man. The illustrations are pretty awesome. My only critique is that the story itself is all over the place. It starts talking about Awesome Man's secret identity, moves on to what Awesome Man does while mad, turns to a battle with his arch nemesis, ends with him hugging his Mommy. It just isn't all that well thought out and put together. Awesome concept, the execution just seemed a bit rushed. I would have liked to see the story focus on things like Awesome Man controlling his anger. That would be both helpful (for the parent) and fun (for the kid). It seemed like the author just wasn't sure what he wanted to do with the character of Awesome Man.<br /><br />The book got 3 stars from me, 5 from my son, for an average of 4.",positive
"This was not Horror/Supernatural. Not a Mystery novel and not a thriller. At best it read like mediocre fan fiction - a blending of William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist meets 21st century blogging.

And I’m not even going to get started with the schizophrenia-versus-demonic-possession aspect. The final chapters, when “the plot twist” is revealed, I just rolled my eyes. Silly, abrupt and not believable or satisfying. Skip this one.",negative

"It is getting common for a story to be told in both the past and in the present.  This 'who done it' thriller was just that, 12 years apart.  I found the pace went very past in the first couple of chapters in trying to absorb all the characters, it was a little confusing. In total there were three possible suspects and boy, the author really kept you guessing, feeding you with tidbits and when you thought who it was, you are back at square one.  Ooh, by the way, this is an English author so expect a lot of British jargon which you will love.  All set in the cosmopolitan city of Brighton .. Where a fetishness so gross, you wonder if the bugger was ever going to be caught.  All I can say is, yes and no!

I thought this would be a great idea for keeping us to our nutrition goals and I really think it will be.  We have tested a couple days and it went ok so we are ready to scale to full weeks. I do have to say that my partner is a vegetarian so we ended up having to get a second book about vegetarian food prepping to have enough ideas to make it work for weeks, but this book was great at helping with the planning and ideas behind the system.  We find the need for quick food our biggest blocker to eating healthy and to make us want to eat out.  This definitely curbed those impulses for the two days we prepped for.  I think this has a lot of promise for our resolutions.  The recipes we could use were great but would have liked more photos of the food for inspiration.  All in all a very good book.",positive
"This is book 3 in the Jane Madison series. The bulk of the story has some moments where the description of what the author is talking about,has a tendency to drag on with too many details,but for the most part, I liked this book the most out of the 3. I say that because Jane has a very important decision to make in this one...she must choose between staying with the man she has finally fallen in love with,who accepts her for who she is..or to develop her magical powers.  While in the months that she is deciding,she is also too busy to keep practicing witchcraft,so it ends up fading...a lot.,the stones and crystals are turning to dust and the ink on the pages of her special books of spells is disappearing. David,her warder tells her she must use her powers to make them strong and come back to her...so she creates an anime to help her clean and restore her magical tools....but while she is performing her creative spell,she is distracted by the memory of her passionate night with David...and unknowingly creates a monster,...no problem there right? ,Lol until the anime runs away and can not be found.....the adventure in the book really picks up then..and the reason I think this is the best book so far is because of what happens after she finds out that the anime is missing...Jane truely comes into her own after the anime captures Neko,her familiar.!!  Lots of surprises in this one !",positive
"FRIEND REQUEST is yet another novel about something terrible that happened when the main character was in high school; that comes to light again years later; that causes serious trauma or detriment to the adult character.  In this example, the main character (Louise) did things that contributed to the death of a schoolmate (Maria) some 25 years earlier.  Louise is now a single, working mother of a young son (Henry), and she’s struggling to cope with daily life.  What she doesn’t need is a Facebook “friend request” from the long-dead Maria.<br /><br />The story is told in Louise’s first-person narrative, mostly in chapters alternating between things as they are now (2016) and things as they were then (1989).  It’s all about teenage relationships (cruel as only these can be), and toxic adult relationships (a high school reunion, domestic violence).  Through it all, Louise comes across consistently as fearful, ineffectual, insecure, and woefully eager to please.<br /><br />The plot moves slowly, through flashbacks, and when the mystery is finally revealed, it isn’t very satisfying. The writing is okay, but there are no likeable or particularly memorable characters.  The basic idea (what would you do if you received a “friend request” from a dead person) is intriguing, but the novel itself is extremely disappointing.",negative

"First time novelist Charles French proves himself a canny storyteller, shifting time frames and geographic locations, but never losing sight of his central plot and always building dramatic tension.  The action is character-driven, and what a colorful and well-drawn group of characters he has created.  Maledicus is subtitled The Investigative Paranormal Society, Book One.  I'm already looking forward to Book Two.  Docked one star for the small typeface (kind of tough on these tired eyes) and too many typos.",positive

She goes on to stand up to him, fight for what she wants and learns how to be a woman and a wife. I liked that she wasn't a pushover, she dealt with what was in front of her and didn't let it easy at her. Troy was just a man...a strong, overbearing sometimes ass.

"Many reviewers have pointed out the geographical and historical inaccuracies, and I agree with all of them.  Most of the biographical information is superficial . I don't understand how a book of such low quality is published.  The writing is also poor.  When making a point about the sexual culture of the time, the author tells us they talked and wrote about sex but weren't necessarily having that much.  Then she compares this to today, where sex saturates our media but ""teenage pregnancies are lower""-- she means today's teenagers aren't having much sex either.  (I could list five reasons why pregnancies are lower having nothing to do with sexual activity).  I say this as an example of the thoughtless approach to much of this historical material.  I read this book from my local library as an audiobook.  I would have returned it if I paid for it.",negative

"I loved this book! My only criticism (and the reason I gave it 4.5 stars and not 5) was having to follow five different characters and their stories simultaneously made it feel very stop and start. The chapters were short and sharp and each was left on a cliffhanger (which I loved), but because you then read four other characters' stories you lose any tension and momentum built up by the time you came back around. For example, I loved Christopher's storyline but by the time I then read Nick, Mandy, Jade, and Ellie's chapters and got back to Christopher, I had almost forgotten what had happened in his story and had to go back. This was the same for Nick's who was another great character. I think one of the characters could have easily been dropped from the story to make it flow better (maybe Mandy) but overall I loved the concept of this book, the punchy writing, and I cannot wait to see what Netflix did with it!",positive

"I'm coming away from this novel frustrated. On the one hand, the plot is pretty good and unlike many other books. The idea of two famous, spoiled actors getting caught up in a real world crisis and how they adapt - lots of promise there. I sank into the arm chair with a dog and was excited to find out about Charlie Outlaw.<br /><br />My problem is the use of present tense. This can be done quite well if the story stays focused and moves at a reasonably fast pace. However, every single emotion, every single idea, every stream of consciousness thought by each main character is expressed. In excessive detail. At times it was like we were so entwined with the self absorbed inner life of Josie that I forgot where she was or what she was doing. There is also just a ton of heavy handed foreshadowing that diluted the actions and plot turns later. I found myself frustrated and rapidly losing interest in the story with every chapter.  This isn't awful, it just wasn't for me.",negative

"THE RECKONING:  A THRILLER is the second novel in the “Children’s House” series by Scandinavian author Yrsa Sigurdardottir.  The translation is excellent, though I found the plot slightly hard to follow on account of the unfamiliar Scandinavian names of the various characters.  (There is a list of the characters by name, with a pronunciation guide, at the front of the book.)<br /><br />The novel is a police procedural, with Detective Huldar and Child Psychologist Freyja tasked with investigating an odd letter found in a schoolchildren’s time capsule.  In the letter, one unknown child listed six people that he intends to kill.  Ultimately, Huldar and Freyja’s investigation leads them to solving a cold case that involved the mysterious disappearance of an 8-year-old schoolgirl (Vaka).<br /><br />The novel works as a standalone, but it’s best for a new reader to begin with the first one in the series, [[ASIN:1250308380 The Legacy]].  Otherwise the reader won’t understand the complex relationship that exists between Huldar and Freyja.  (The series takes its name from Freyja’s place of employment, a child protection agency called the Children’s House.)<br /><br />The novel isn’t exactly a page-turner, but it’s well-plotted, with a lot of unexpected twists.  Huldar and Freyja are likeable, well-developed characters, that are worthy of their own series.",positive
"Could so little be said and yet you have lived a life time after reading this slim book?  Wow, what amazing story telling, where the author kept the props very simple and everything was focused on what the woman revealed to us through her daily and repetitive routine, her conversation with her husband (who for all we know was paralysed by a flying bullet) and the background noise from the war.  very powerful portrayal of life in a war torn city, religious observations, suppression of women's rights; more importantly, the explosion of emotions, guilt of past and present actions that came pouring out of the woman in a coherent and chronological order of her life.

"I had such high hopes for this book.... world size star ships, battles for survival, a mystery in space.... what's not love? It sounds like classic, old school Science Fiction Space Opera with some creative twists like an entire cast of women,  worlds that are bio-mechanical and a mysterious defection of the one world-ship Mokshi that involves the lead character's amnesia.<br /><br />In reality, the first several chapters followed the description of the space opera that I thought I was settling in to enjoy. Yet, the plot and story devolved rather rapidly in a weird mish mash of horror, monster story, quest through lower &#34;hell&#34; levels for the lead, Zan (the amnesiac) and some sort of political machinations involving a secret plot and birth by the second main character, Jayd, on a different world ship. None of these things really worked well together or tied smoothly to each other. This a case of a book that is trying to be too many things all at once and doing none of them particularly well. I never felt like I could visualize the actual world ships or their interior design/layout and that made it nearly impossible to suspend belief and immerse into the book. &#34;Stars are Legion&#34; just wasn't for me.",negative

"Another Graham Greene & John Le Carre wannabe, without the required level of talent.  It's not the writing style (it's not bad, really) it's a really dumb (sophomoric) plot, developed slowly & painfully and rather pretentiously, while the characters remain rather shallow.  I lost interest about a quarter of the way through -- I stopped caring what was going to happen to the principal characters, which is rather telling.<br /><br />Also, Cumming seems to be the kind of Brit for whom the ultimate bad guys are Americans, especially the evil military-industrial-political-espionage complex.  (Yes, I know, Hollywood's full of this too.)  I can tolerate some of this nonsense if the story is compelling, but for this book it's not worth the price.",negative
"This book is fascinating but it took me a long time to read due to its textbook like material. Although, this is written in layman's terms, there is so much science packed into this text that it is hard for me to remember it all. <br /><br />The author trys to explain why nature and nurture lead to disease. The predominant topic discussed is the theory that our epigenetic inheritance, which is the ""biological transmission to offspring of changes to gene expression"" and our eipgnome, which is the ""network of compounds surrounding our genes, which interacts with our environment, althering gene expression in response to exrernal influences,""  determines our propensity for disease. Of course it is not as simple as this as our gut bateria, our childhood exposure to abuse and neglect, pathogens, pharmaceutical drugs, etc. affect disease progression as well.<br /><br />Based on this text, the science is just emerging. There is no definitive correlation with many of these theories except where numerous studies appear to support the various hypotheses.<br /><br />In summary, our risk for various disease is a result of our inherited genetics going as far back as our grandparents and the changes that get expressed in these genes based on our environmental impact such as nutrition, stress, sleep, gut bacteria, etc. This is an incredibly complex subject but the theories are somewhat uplifting because it appears we can, to some extent, change our genetics (nature) with our environment (nuture).<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because the subject matter is intense and mostly unproven theory. However, this book is well-written and is certainly facinating to those interested in why we each might suffer from different diseases.",positive

"""Knocked Out By My Nunga-Nungas"" is the third in Louise Rennison's ""confessions of Georgia Nicolson"" series, a sort of teenage Bridget Jones who humorously captures in her diary her life in her British high school, her continuing romance with Robbie, Sex God and member of the Stiff Dylans, the misadventures of her ferocious cat Angus and her deranged little sister Libby, her loonie parents, and the general angst of being a teenager (chest size, fuzzy eyebrows, snoggability, proper application of makeup for specific occasions, etc). This instalment sees Georgia lusting after a former flame, Dave the Laugh, as well as schoolwide lust over the new French teacher Henri. We tag along on Georgia's miserable family vacation to Och Aye Land (Scotland), where the local ""club"" is the supermarket and Angus and Libby are munching on haggis together. Later, back at school, we follow Gee through her typical days of misbehaviour, pranks, and plotting. Laugh out loud funny, always original, can't wait to read the next one in the series!",positive

"So we have a wonderful Spanish Learning library for our four middle grade Spanish learners and I feel wonderfully blessed to have a good library of children's books from Cuenta de Luz publishing.  I was super excited to get another reviewer book to add to it.  Imagine my surprise when I paged through it and there was not a single word of text in the book.  Oh well, it is a nice little story with wonderful and lighthearted illustrations of a dog encountering a flurry of birds that ""gift"" it with a flower. Perfect for very young readers, not so good for learning new vocabulary and verb tenses.  So this is the weakest book in the series for us, but we still love nearly everything from Cuenta de Luz, the stories are quirky and they have served as great learning books.

One becomes a widow after a few months of marriage while the other ones gets dumped by her boyfriend of ten plus years. The sisters are brought together by their sudden singleness and become closer as a result. The descriptions and details in the story are wonderful!

They would be great for summer reading, remedial work, or supplemental work. They are also great for kids who like to play school. The pictures are nice, glossy good quality pictures. Each book has the answers in the back. There is a wide variety of things covered. And while they are math books, they would also be helpful for reading for kids who like non-fiction reading.",positive
"This book is an excellent read for fans of Wilson Pickett or soul music in general.  It provides inside information, a behind the scenes look, so to speak, about the recordings of Wilson Pickett.  There are stories of how songs were written and what went on in the studios when Pickett’s records were made.  The inner workings of studios like Stax in Memphis or Fame in Muscle Shoals are described in detail, and many of the musicians who played a significant role in Pickett’s recordings are identified.  Even readers who are well versed in the history of soul music are likely to learn something new from reading Tony Fletcher’s book.<br /><br />The personal side of Wilson Pickett’s life is another story, however.  He was a troubled individual whose self-destructive behavior stood in sharp contrast to his enormous talent.  Fletcher provides a complete picture of the man, both good and bad.  Wilson Pickett should probably best be remembered for the many outstanding recordings that made him a soul music legend, but for those readers who want to know the whole story of a complicated artist, Tony Fletcher’s well-researched Pickett biography is probably the best place to look.",positive
"If one buys this book expecting an account of 22SAS's fight against the Provos during the 'Troubles' in Ulster as I did, you'll be unhappy.<br />It's basically a recounting of 'ALL' (oh suuure!) the secret agencies activities in Ulster from the late 70's onwards but only a portion is focused on the 'ice cream boys' and even that is heavily, heavily tinged with the author's prejudices of whether one is permitted to shoot a terrorist or not.<br />(After all, killers have feelings too).<br />As an academic exercise - two out of five stars (Additional to the obvious pro-gunman sympathy of the author there were several large inaccuracies presented as factual. Hint to writer - for their own reasons not everybody tells you the truth, and you might find other texts on this conflict very instructive if you care to read them carefully.

"My interest is mostly on deep and reinforcement learning, so the review is more pertinent to Step 6. I hate the textbook or technical book, which introduce something without proper context, notation explanation. You don't have to explain everything and cover every base - it is a fast moving area.

This book should have been turned over to an Introvert to write or else the author should have, at a bare minimum, collaborated with an Introvert author. Pick up any book written for an Introvert audience by a bona fide Introvert author and you'll find a completely different tone to the book with an abundance of  substance and depth. Not so for this book. I found myself recoiling about half way through the book and completely deflated in energy. Like another 2-star reviewer, I didn't finish reading it, which is rare for me also. This book is going in my recycle pile. Maybe somebody else can benefit from the material to good effect, but for true Introverts, don't waste your time.

"WRITTEN IN BLOOD introduces Joe “Preach” Everson, a damaged cop tasked with solving a series of murders staged like famous literary murders (Dostoevsky, Poe, Christie, Nabokov).  That’s two current mystery/thriller cliches out of the way!  Everson is probably healed by the end, but he isn’t all that interesting while damaged—his troubled mind is mostly useful for showcasing introspective reflections on the inhumanity of man.  (Everson is to be forgiven, perhaps, because he’s a former preacher.)<br /><br />The novel is reasonably well-plotted, but NOT so well written.  Important details about the characters get lost in the verbiage of the early chapters, so that even the reader attentive for clues may find him/herself asking, “Where did I read before about that character’s background?” as specific items are referenced later.  The narrative also includes a number of unnecessary, jarring similes (e.g., “He wished he was inside the lounge, … eating a bone-in rib eye as rare as a blue diamond” (ch. 34; uses two different meanings of “rare”)).<br /><br />Also, there’s a heck of a lot of literary criticism, fed to Joe by his love interest, a bookstore clerk/comparative lit major/law student named Ari.  As nearly as I can tell, the analysis of the context of the literary murders added nothing to the actual solution of the murders.<br /><br />Layton Green is the author of the Dominic Grey series (beginning with [[ASIN:1477805087 The Summoner]], which I liked a little better.",negative

"Until the final few pages, DEATH BY HIS GRACE (A DARKO DAWSON MYSTERY) is a terrific police procedural—a fast-reading, page-turner of a novel with an interesting plot and strong characterization.  Like the previous series books, it is set in Ghana (though the setting is rather incidental to the story this time).<br /><br />As a reader who has come to like Chief Inspector Darko Dawson very much (through this and earlier novels), I’m extremely disappointed by the ending.  Not only does it leave many loose ends (e.g., the murderer’s motivation and trigger point; the other suspects’ reasons for lying to investigators; the victim’s own possibly immoral behavior), it may also signal the end of the Darko Dawson series itself.<br /><br />If it is the final series book, then I think that the Darko Dawson character deserved far better treatment by his creator.  If there are more series books to come, then the ending is a cliffhanger of the worst kind—a mere gimmick to inspire readers to purchase the next book.  Whichever is true, the sudden ending to this book turns me completely off the series, and I won’t be reading any more of them.",negative

"I selected this novel with the hopes of being taken on a journey to a faraway place, on an adventure that would hold my interest and give me something to think about when I finished it. Unfortunately, it is a book that I have been unable to finish due to the writing style and characters I do not like. It is a good effort, and it is a fairly immersive story, but I will be blunt and say I just didn’t like it enough to finish it.<br /><br />The basic premise is a post-apocalypse world where one man with foresight has prepared an escape for himself, his family and a select group of friends and acquaintances, aboard a ship that is stocked well enough to support the relatively small group aboard. This is a similar plot to the short story “Mayflower II” by Stephen Baxter, about an escape from earth using a starship after an invasion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the The Ship does not borrow enough from Mayflower II. Some reviewers have stated that the writing is good, but I find the style to be choppy, hard to follow and very disjoint at times. Worse, I do not like the majority of the characters in this novel, who are either naive to the point of painful, arrogant or just downright obnoxious.<br /><br />I confess that I did not finish this book. I tried to like it and I tried to be objective as I read...I really, really tried.<br /><br />I like the premise of the book and think the storyline had a lot of promise. Unfortunately, I feel it was let down by uneven writing and unlikable characters.

"Although I love LEGO and miniatures, I’ve never been particularly interested in building microscale LEGO models--there is too much loss of detail in the end.  This book, LEGO MICRO CITIES:  BUILD YOUR OWN MINI METROPOLIS!, illustrates the “problem”:  although the colorful endpapers show four different city models (Bridge Town, Hyperloop City, Steamworks, Upper Brick Side), the models and buildings all look very similar.  There are only so many different “looks” that you can achieve by combining the smaller LEGO elements.<br /><br />The book has complete instructions for eight different city models.  The ones not previously mentioned are Gilded City, Tomorrowland, Utopia, and Strange New Worlds.<br /><br />Basically, this book is helpful for LEGO fans who want to get started on building their own microscale architectural models (models along the lines of the official LEGO sets in the “Architecture” theme series).  It explains how to construct different types of tiny buildings (round, rectangular, or stacked skyscrapers, for instance), as well as how to create tiny but recognizable trains, ships, trees, statues, trees, etc.  There are also tips on how to solidly attach various components to the baseplate and other elements.<br /><br />Hardcore LEGO aficionados will enjoy looking through this well-done book.  However, it’s quite limited in scope, and of course you will end up buying bricks if you want to replicate the models shown in the book.",positive

I felt the setting was spot on for time and place so I found that enjoyable. The main characters and their thoughts and dialogue just seemed jarring to me. I thought Grace, for being 26, and head of a household of 7 siblings thought and acted, at times, like a 16 year old.",negative
"I was on board for the whole story up until the end of the book, which I can't identify - it was supposed to be either a third act or a denouement (it is written as a screenplay in all except for format and the inclusion of unspoken thoughts). The author doesn't so much end the book as he does stop writing.<br /><br />All of the little logical gotchas that take you out of the story and draw attention to flaws in the plot - all that stuff is there in much greater force than in previous books. And the solution to the nominal goal - where is this mysterious staircase in D.C. under a great stone building - is telegraphed from the beginning. Also Malach's secret identity was obvious from the beginning of his backstory. The most interesting thing that keeps the pages turning is the little cryptogram contained in the Masons' Pyramid, but of course that turns out to be a huge letdown.<br /><br />I'd summarize the entertainment quality of this book like this: it was just barely worth my time, no regrets yet, but if Dan Brown's next book doesn't come back up to the level of craftsmanship I'm used to, that will be the end of my interest in his books.",negative

It covers women from all over the world and all throughout history to modern times. It's filled with photographs and illustrations. It covers a lot of information, but doesn't give out too much detail about most of the subjects. So if you find a topic to be particularly interesting, you would be on your own to find out more. I think the material is presented well. It's easy to just pick it up and jump around, which I like.",positive

"SPOILER ALERT: If I understand EXHIBIT ALEXANDRA: A NOVEL at all, it is a novel about a mentally ill performance artist (Alexandra/Amelia) who transforms her own life into the ultimate performance art installation, an installation that is intended to be exhibited in a New York art gallery.  Why anyone would be interested in viewing the resulting exhibition is beyond me, but then I've never cared for or understood performance art anyway.<br /><br />This debut novel is told in first-person narrative, largely in flashbacks, in alternating “now” and “then” chapters. (Sadly, this seems to be the current fashion in debut-novel-writing.)  There is enough interior angst to fill a dozen novels.  The angst is mostly in the form of the artist’s vicarious imaginings of how her abandoned husband and daughters are reacting and feeling after her disappearance and apparent murder.<br /><br />To the extent that this novel purports to examine the conflicts faced by an ambitious “career woman” who finds herself trapped in the role of “stay-at-home mother”, it’s stale and trite.  It really has nothing new to offer on the subject, and the unlikeable “unreliable narrator” isn’t to be excused for escaping from suburbia in the extreme, selfish, and delusional manner that she chooses.  Her justifications at the end of the book fall totally flat.<br /><br />This novel is definitely NOT what one expects from a novel classified as a mystery/thriller.  It isn’t a thriller, because there’s no excitement; it isn’t a mystery because there’s a disappearance without a crime to be solved.  Maybe the novel is properly classified as “literary fiction”, but however you classify it, it’s a boring, repetitive, confusing novel that’s a total waste of the reader’s time.",negative

For example, if the question is “A baby is born with trisomy 21.  What is most likely associated with this syndrome?”  A.  Coarc<br />B.  Duodenal Atresia or C.  Tetralogy of Fellot.<br />The answer is B because Duodenal Atresia is associated with Trisomy 21.  The other books I have go into what the other wrong answers are associated with or what they are, and what the right answer means and what it is.  And the questions do not seem to have a difficulty level of the other books I have.",negative
"I have been wanting to read this book for years, and after reading all of the glowing reviews for it, I thought it might make for an exciting afternoon off work. I was wrong. This book has a lot of tech-jargon in it and I found that boring. I thought I would love this book because it was the story of a real storm, real lives in jeopardy and the supposedly gripping tale of six men and their journey out to sea to find their individual fortunes. What I found was a book that had some brilliant moments of literary genius, for example, when describing the storm, but unfortunately the rest of the book read like a longer article that would have been submitted to a monthly magazine for men. I didn't feel much for the characters in the book, which is sad since they were real people not fictional creations.<br /><br />I kept hoping while I was reading this book that it would become more exciting and that the human element would come more into focus. I already knew when I started this book that the boat disappeared, i felt that was a given. I wanted to know more about how...when...why things occurred and why the decisions affected those lives happened. I felt this book honestly would have been a great read if I had been looking for a book of technical fact and not a thrilling adventure, but this book did not live up to what the cover promised.",negative

"At first, I really liked Feng, and felt myself hoping for better things in her life. But as the story went on, and Feng became more bitter, twisted, and narcissistic, I felt myself disliking her intensely. It also seemed quite unbelievable that her personality would change so abruptly. This in turn, affected my enjoyment of the book. Sadly, the book was quite a disappointment.",negative
"I'm not thrilled with this book. My kids love logic, so I thought this would be right up their alley. Many of the brain teasers have to be seen to be understood, so it isn't something you can really read aloud or use for a classroom. The alien narrating the book gives you their pronouns in their introduction. They also use really weird names that are hard to pronounce and use made up words for the aliens and their planet, which make some of the brain teasers really incoherent. My kids didn't like the puzzles all that much. Most of them were super simple, which isn't any fun. We just didn't have much fun with this book.",negative
"This book was disorienting, but not in an entirely unpleasant way. Wink, Poppy, and Midnight circle around each other in a strange story about hopes, fears, longing, and belonging. That, and tales - both told & read.<br /><br />Midnight is certainly the milquetoast, compared to Wink & Poppy. He only exerts his own will a few times in the book, and seems to doubt himself in all but the last instance (which is just a few pages from the end). Wink was mesmerizing, and strangely reminiscent of Luna Lovegood (from the Harry Potter books). Poppy was something out of a CW television show, which was probably the most distracting thing to me. Just too perfect and too cruel and too broken.<br /><br />Much of the story plays out like a CW show, too, in that there is just *so* much teenage melodrama and hormones. And it seems a little too self-aware, for lack of a better phrase. Like the book itself is preening for the reader.<br /><br />But it's mixed in with fairies and taro cards and hauntings, and ultimately a mystery about exactly who is who in this story. This is a quick, well-written book, easy to read in one sitting, and I definitely enjoyed it enough to care how it all ended.",positive

I actually made a pilgrimage to Israel in 2011 and used this book as a sort of a guide to the history and the legacy of the country and its people.

"Alec Ross is right on many things especially China and it’s Belt and Road Initiative. I did become skeptical on his complaints of unions while stating that unions are important in theory. As a former teacher, he claims that teacher unions don’t provide better wages and benefits (they do but as unions get weaker, it’s harder to do), and complains that they spend more time propping up bad teachers who the system wants to fire. Unions guarantee better job safety and security. They provide a method of fairness to those accused of doing a bad job and require administration to prove it. His complaints are like hating lawyers because their clients don’t sound savory. He then says unions are important to workers’ rights.",positive

"A fascinating journey through a gifted musician's adventurous life.  I don't disagree with folks who've opined that it could have used an editor's touch, if only to tighten it up and avoid some redundant stories.  However, it's written in Nix's own hand (and therefore in his unique Southern voice) and that's one of its main draws.  He tells his life story, along with sidebar tales involving friendships and encounters with the rich, talented, and famous, but he never comes across as a mere rock 'n' roll namedropper.  I especially like the way he sums up his Elvis adventures in Memphis: ""Looking back on those days it seems to me there were two Elvises.  The first one I saw hanging out, playing pranks, laughing, and having fun.  The other Elvis came later.  The one no one saw.  The one who had all the trouble.""  Man, that's about as good as a great film noir opening, yes?",positive
"This book has about one-fifth the ""story line"" even of book 4, and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux, greyscale, bad weather and maggoty food.  NOT what one would expect from the author being touted as the ""American Tolkein.""<br />It's utterly unsatisfying, to the point where I am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.<br />If you feel compelled to read it, just to find out how bad it is for yourself, at least don't spend any money on it.  Go get it at the library.  You'll feel slightly less ripped off that way",negative
"This is a fast paced book that I read in one afternoon. The premise was interesting. There's enough medical/scientific info that made it realistic, but not too much that I found it over my head.

It definitely makes you think regarding medical morality issues.",positive
"The previous journals have been full of blank space with a few pages of prompts at the beginning and then again at the end, and then blank sections to keep a journal/planner in 4-week sections. This is full of motivational articles and lots of images, with much less room to write things down. If I want to read ""Breathe,"" I will buy an issue. When I buy a journal I want room to write in it myself.<br /><br />Very disappointed and not intending to buy this year's version. Have been going from bookstore to bookstore and going on line buying copies of previous years' volumes instead. I don't care if the calendars included inside don't match. It's much more important to have the room to journal in.<br /><br />Please bring back the old design.",negative

&lt;strong>This book lost me&lt;/strong><br /><br />This writer is very good with words but this story was terrible. Esp toward the end. It went everywhere. And someone is held captive for almost a year and they don't have trauma upon release and can go out and eat ice cream like nothing happened? Totally became unbelievable for me two thirds thru and then the last part was awful. Bobby just appears and it takes the writer too much time to explain his showing up and its never fully explained how a nine yr old got to Newark alone bc if he came w Lucinda she would have told Julian right away about Kendall and then he would have done something right off. Frankly the entire Bobby part was dumb and really sadly the part about Julian's marriage was boring. Just a setup for the last bad section of the book. This book could have ended much sooner with a better well thought our ending. A romance novel turned spy novel turned detective novel. Lost me.,negative
"I have to admit that I am not the biggest fan of this genre, but my kids have consumed the Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Big Nate series, so I was interested in seeing if this is another good series for them. It is a quick read and I burned through it in an evening.  The humor is standard to the genre, a little sarcastic, perhaps a little less bodily gross than most, but all in all a little juvenile.  Which is fine for what it is, but probably a big reason why I am not big on the genre.<br /><br />The illustrations are good, and for the most part are funnier than the text.  Nearly every page has a large illustration which also makes the book such a quick read.  The story is decent, a story of a boy finding his own way and place in the world, learning where his true talents lie. Characters are fine...all in all this is a perfectly fine book.  We'll see how the kids like it, would love to see them tear into it and possibly the rest of the series, but our youngest is now nine, so we might be outgrowing this genre.",positive
"I love vegetables so I ordered this book because of the plant-based recipes and not because it is associated with an alkaline diet.<br /><br />I read this from cover to cover and selected all the recipes I would make. The first chapter is about the alkaline way of eating and recommends introducing such a diet to  reduce the burden on one's body related to  nutrient deficiencies, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular and digestive illnesses, etc.<br /><br />I decided to make the roasted potato hash. It smelled fabulous as I was cooking it. Now the recipes never take me the short time it says in the book. It took me a couple of hours to make this even though it said 15 minutes each for prep and cooking. Also, it asks for a large shallow pan. I grabbed a jumbo shallow pan and luckily I did because it was overflowing with the required ingredients. In addition, step four lists garlic twice but that is just an editing error. The resulting hash was excellent and very tasty. I am confident the other recipes will be too but I must ignore the prep and cook times because they never apply to me. I'm a very slow cook and can never cut up items like expected. For this particular recipe, it took me about one hour to prepare and 45 minutes to cook, not counting clean-up, serving, and other time.<br /><br />I really like this book and am glad I ordered it because there are more than a few recipes I find enticing. Note that there are hardly any photos in this book.",positive

"I've always enjoyed Jeffrey Deaver.  This is my first Colter Shaw novel.  Shaw general makes his money by securing offered rewards to find missing people.  In this case, he's asked to protect Allison, the brilliant ex-wife of a cop turned felon and her sixteen year old daughter, Hannah FROM her ex, Jon.  Jon has just been released prematurely from what was to be a three year sentence.  He brutally assaulted Allison in a drunken rage and now word is he is going to kill her.  Allison is already gone when Shaw comes on board, hired by her employer, a nuclear energy based company on the cutting edge.  Allison is their star scientist/inventor.  A very complicated story ensues involving police ambiguity (are they supporting their old colleague by their inaction?); crazy contract killers (why did Jon hire them?); Hannah's teenagerness and belief in her father until she doesn't (teen resistance to her mother's efforts to protect her or actually evil?) and ultimately, Shaw's relationship to the various tendrils of the investigation and his protection responsibilities.  He's that good.  But can he pull this off with all of these variables?  His childhood a a survivalist comes in handy throughout the story and hi ability to spot anomalies.  A satisfying read with a very decent resolution.  Definitely recommend.",positive

"I am a DK book lover. I've started getting the DK Smithsonian collaborations. In my opinion, they're the grownup version of the traditional DK books. This is what I would classify as a coffee table book. I have a stack of similar books on my bookshelf in the living room. They're great for picking up and perusing. There's usually no obligation to read it straight through. I like to skim and pick the pages that interest me at that moment. The pictures in this book are gorgeous. Clear, crisp photos, maps, art work, and more. Items are labeled and described thoroughly. This is really an amazing book!",positive

"Received this one as a gift.  What a nice surprise it turned out to be.  With Have a Little Faith, Michael Elliott has delivered a John Hiatt bio that reads like a fine Hiatt LP.  It's concise, observational, to-the-point, revels in clever turns-of-phrase, and finds hope and truth in the simple yet complex ways the road of life takes us.  It reads like a series of time-tested classic Hiatt compositions.  Like a lot of folks, I came to Hiatt first by covers (Three Dog Night's Sure as I'm Sitting Here, Bonnie Raitt's Thing Called Love, Desert Rose Band's She Don't Love Nobody), then by his career changing Bring the Family LP.  And what a wonderful career it has turned out to be!  But the backstories are deep and wide, and Hiatt has survived and thrived over many a heartbreak and setback.  You don't have to know all of his music to enjoy this read, but it helps to have a handle on the most important among his songs and albums.  One story in particular really hit me: When he's in Elvis Presley's Rolls and kind of breaks into tears, explaining it was because he realized ""just how trapped he was ...  Just trapped.  He was just a poor mama's boy from Mississippi.""  As a lifelong fan of Elvis, I could truly relate to John Hiatt's humanity in this special moment.  Riding with the King, indeed.  Highly recommended.",positive

"There are a number of good books out on the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber - for example Bill Sweetman's INSIDE THE STEALTH BOMBER and Steve Pace's B-2 SPIRIT: The Most Capable War Machine on the Planet - but Thomas Withington's book breaks new and exciting ground by focusing on the aircraft's performance in actual combat. It's one thing to be a tremendously expense Cold War relic, but it's quite another to be a liable first strike capability in today's day and age. The combination of stealth low-observability, precision strike, long range, and payload flexibility makes the B-2 Spirit the weapon of choice at the start of hostilities. The book covers three campaigns - Allied Force, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom - and describes this aircraft's remarkable performance and some of it's short comings. This is a remarkable book packed with a lot of new information, good pictures, and great airwork. It's a must read for anyone interested in America's projection of global air power.",positive

"If you suffer from vestibular migraines, this cookbook is just a godsend.  There is super useful info - easy to read and understand and BONUS  - great recipes too. This is a diagnosis for me so I am busy collecting all the info I can.  This is the book I go back to again and again - especially right now when I am just learning how to live with this diagnosis. On the cooking section,  I need photos when I cook anything - and -  this  so much more than a cookbook - but when you get to the recipe sections the photos are plentiful and beautiful.  Lots and lots of them.  This book as a whole is worth every single penny.  As I get through some of the recipes I will check back in if it seems an update of my review would be helpful.  They seem reasonable for anyone who has a general understanding of how to cook - no julia childs or martha stewart like stuff as far as I can see.

"What a story! It's been a while since I've read a complete saga. Lately, I've been reading fluff, so I am pleased to have chosen something a little more substantial this time. From the first chapter, I was hooked. I read this over the course of a week, with the last few days completing the bulk of it. The book has an interesting approach of telling the life story of Cyril. It jumps in increments of 7 years, starting with the time before his birth and leading up to his arrival, all the way to a few months before his death as an old man. I found it compelling and engaging throughout the whole book. It brought out several different emotions as I read it. There were times when I pitied Cyril. There were things that angered me. And there were times that made me laugh. It sort of reminded me of Angela's Ashes - but that may just be the Irish Catholic thing. I am so glad that chose this as one of my summer reads.",positive
"Talk to the Paw is a sweet, slow moving romance. MacGyver, the cat, has match making skills.

Jamie, new to town, is trying to find her life passion while David is still getting over the death of his wife. It was a little slow moving at times and I found it easy to stop at the end of a chapter instead of keep on reading. Overall, I enjoyed it.",positive
"Okay, bring the knowledge of biolofpdy, nature, the birds and the bees, a deep refresher course for those who enjoyed studying these subjects at school; and throw in the theory of quantum physics.  What do you get?  A PhD I hope.  I love biology and quantum physics, at high scholl, but never took it up to college level, the material in th book is detailed enough for the learned, but you don't have to get it all to enjoy the book.  The book did a good job in providing the fundamentals before adding the quantum aspect in it, and yes, I couldn't believe how far quantum physics has come and if nothing else, you will be more impressed in the wonders of nature.

"This was my first Beatriz Williams novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This novel is set in three different time periods - 1930, 1951 and 1969. It takes place on an east coast island. It's well written and very engaging. I didn't want to put it down. I had a little difficulties keeping all of the characters straight when the time periods changed and I would have to go back and reread parts to figure out who was who, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. There's romance, drama, secrets, and more. I am looking forward to reading other books by this author.",positive

"Something about this story seemed a bit familiar.  All weekend I couldn't get the feeling that I'd read this book before.  I chatted with my husband, but he said it was highly likely and he'd read lots of sci fi with similar scenario.<br /><br />Finally, I revisited my bookshelf and aha!  I found three books with super identicle storylines.<br /><br />The first book is The Warrior Heir by Cinda Chima Williams, about a boy who finds out he is part of a giant game where people with powers compete for dominance.<br /><br />The second book is The Maze Runner by James Dashner.  The third is The Decoy Princess and the fourth is The Game by Monica Hughes, it turns out, I've read a lot of these stories, because I thought up two others later that night when I was making dinner.<br /><br />But the problem is that I didn't really care for the writing style or the characters in this book.<br /><br />I forced myself to keep reading, I know how easily bored I can get with a book,  I've often given up on a story after just a few paragraphs only to come back to it later and then love it to pieces (Hunger Games, The 5th Wave.<br /><br />But, Endgame just never really sparked for me.

"Dave, I read your book and it was painful to read, it took a month to get through it. None of it is original. It's all information taken from other people's books, reports, and internet websites. From this information Dave has fashioned his own idea of what went down that night, including an entire fictitious conversation between Patsy and Jonbenet Ramsey on the night of the murder, on which he bases his belief of Patsy Ramsey's guilt, this and the ransom note. But a ransom note does not a murderer make, Patsy was not the only one in the house that night, and he has not considered that a woman could conceivably cover for a family member. He fails to explain the many inconsistencies in the Patsy Did It Theory and simply relies on imagination to fill in the blanks. I am not comfortable calling a dead mother of a dead child a murderer with what little evidence Dave Hughes has to offer. It is obvious he cares about finding the murderer of Jonbenet, but I do not believe he is on the right track. I regret ever reading this book. I would recommend reading books written by those who actually investigated the crime, although some had differing opinions, they had first hand knowledge. One book was written by the lead investigator for the DA, James Kolar, who saw all the evidence, collected through all the years, something none of the other investigators had been able to see. All their books bring a knowledgeable, true, and first hand perspective, something &#34;An Angel Betrayed&#34; lacks.",negative
"CADAVER & QUEEN is the weirdest historical mystery/romance that I’ve ever encountered.  Set in Victorian England, it tells the story of a female student’s first year at a medical school renowned for its research and development into Bio-Mechanical soldiers.  Bio-Mechanicals are re-animated cadavers, sometimes fitted with artificial limbs or cadaver limbs, that are able to perform menial tasks (e.g., mopping floors).  The hope is that the Bio-Mechanicals will be able to replace live soldiers in warfare.  (All this is fiction.)<br /><br />In the novel, the student (Lizzy) and a couple of male friends explore the complicated buildings and secret passages of the school (Ingold), which occupies a former Cistercian monastery in isolated Yorkshire North Riding.  They are attempting to solve the mysterious disappearances of wounded-soldier patients and village locals.  What exactly are their medical professors doing with the cadavers they collect?  What are the professors plotting with regard to the ancient and ailing Queen Victoria?  And what is happening with a certain almost-human Bio-Mechanical (Victor), who is unusually violent but appears capable of conscious thought?<br /><br />The novel starts slowly, but once you get into the premise, the book has a certain horrid fascination.  The possibility of a romance developing between Lizzy and Victor (can it really be happening?) is mighty creepy.  However, the mystery plot is decent enough, and all the strange loose ends get tied up at the end.",positive
"I didn't like this book. I didn't like the people in it. For the most part they're vapid, vain and self absorbed. The not-quite-rich with more money than sense.<br />I didn't like the author. When he's not insulting the people he's dealing with over their oversized houses with oversized garages he's sounding bitter and jealous over the very same things, often making sure we know the square footage of many the houses he's been invited into.<br />We read about the people who obsess, over decorations, over lighting displays, over shopping. I was particularly offended by those people in the story who had a friend dying of cancer and after decorating the woman's house they completely, utterly, ignored her. Do these people really think they ""brought her so much joy!"" by refusing to visit her in her last weeks on Earth? Were some free lights and tinsel a fair exchange for being ignored by her friends at Christmas?<br />I don't know why the author chose this subject or these people but this just made me sad. I felt sorry for these people. I wasn't amused or enlightened. The dry facts about the billions shelled out (and the amounts these families spent individually) during the Christmas season added nothing. Maybe if Hank Stuever had decided to focus on the overlooked people, the service people, the cashiers, the poor he'd have had a good Christmas story to tell. This, this only made me not want anything to do with Christmas this year.",negative

"First, I will say that writing a book is an important accomplishment in itself, and anyone who does it, deserves stars for that alone.  This, unfortunately, is a very poorly written novel, and the author is not totally to blame.  If editors were involved, they let her down - or perhaps they don't know what good writing is.  Some reviews refer to the &#34;writing style&#34;.  This is not a style the author will want to carry on through any future writings.  And, she may want to find a truly professional editor.<br /><br />After reading several pages of the first chapter, I brought out my yellow marker, thinking that my writing workshop could benefit from some writing examples of what not to do.  By the end of Chapter One, my pages were damp and a sea of yellow.  I quit at that point, as the writing was too frustrating to go any farther.  Why did I buy this book?  Here, I learned a serious lesson myself.  I judged the book by the cover and the number of good reviews.  The cover was intriguing and the number of five star reviews was impressive.  Now, I am having a difficult time understanding those good reviews.<br /><br />Historical fiction is my favorite read, and those who wrote the 5 star reviews should read some really good novels in that genre.  Very quickly they will be able to see a great difference.  I suggest The Nightengale and the Summer Before the War - two elegantly written novels.<br /><br />I won't be finishing this book, but I will hang on to it.

"I was very disappointed in this book. Prior to Hurricane Harvey, my yard in Houston had been planted carefully and bloomed all year long ( well, 11 months) based on our climate.  Most all the plants and our grass died in the heavy flood, which has taken us 4 years to finally get to the yard. I was thrilled to find a book with Year Round Bloomers, expecting it to make my job easier. However....inside the book cover, there are no good pictures like the hard-cover outside. You have no idea what the plants he discusses look like unless you go to the computer. I also wish he had categorized bloomers by regional zones, so you knew if it grew and bloomed in your zone. Instead, it feels like they were just trying to get out another book to sell with his known name...without care for customer needs or expectations.",negative

"OMG what a ride!! This book is filled with suspense, love, hate, corruption and most of all...determination. Sally is married to a very abusive man. When she is approached by her best friend Jude about her helping to bring down the syndicate, she hesitates,but after her husband beats her yet again,she agrees to help. Hubby Billy works for the mob as a muscle..eliminating who ever the boss tells him to so Sally needs to be very careful. Her relationship with a man from her past Alex complicates things as well. This is not only an amazing story..but it is also a story of the abuse that women face everyday in their life. It is a story of determination and trying to stay alive ..no matter what. It is amazing how Sally seems so meek and timid in the beginning,but after she has a son she does a complete turn around to protect her son, Zander and keep them both alive. Wonderful characters,with a very real storyline. I received a free copy and this  honest review was my choice. I also purchased this in print because I LOVE THIS series. I recommend reading this series in order to get the &#34;WOW&#34; factor.",positive

"Kaplan-Maxfield brings the world of college-age students fully to life and draws you into their action-packed week-long mystery that's full of twists, turns, magic, mystery, and intrigue -- skillfully and artfully intertwined with a serious and insightful religious and philosophical journey shepherded by Boston College's professors and priests, some sincere, some dastardly, and some you just aren't sure about. You won't be able to put the book down right from that start and you'll find yourself thoroughly immersed in this life journey compressed into a week's time. Young Jack and Fran lead a quest that deepens the lives of everyone they touch as they are mysteriously chosen to find the Holy Grail - or are they lost in a crazy fantasy world? - that may be hidden somewhere on their beautiful and majestic stone-Gothic campus. It is a story for our day as well as one for all time.",positive

"I love this series! I read the first one a few months ago and LOVED it! I was so excited to learn that there were more books coming. This was exciting and quick paced.  This one isn't quite as good as the first one, but it is still pretty good. The librarian and the spy pose as a married couple on a mission in India. I loved the cultural descriptions. There are lots of nerdy library references again, too. There's lots of spy action and romance. It's steamy, but not graphic. I'm looking forward to the next adventure!",positive

"I wanted to like this book and I really tried, but by page 244/Chapter 28, I had to throw in the towel. It was time to admit defeat and allow myself to just not finish the book. I stopped reading and read another book and then came back to Io - twice - and still couldn't find the pace any more pleasant.<br /><br />I like the premise here and the idea very much. Aliens stranded on Earth for millions of years, cohabitating within our minds and bodies undetected until recently. Now battling amongst themselves and humans taking sides and casualties as a result. I like the fact that it takes place in India and has an Indian centric take on things like geography, food and attitudes toward life. This is totally my kind of story.<br /><br />My problem is with the very slow, plodding pace. Long drawn out conversations that rehash events we already witnessed through the action scenes, repetitive scenes of mundane things - how many descriptions of Ella training in a gym and being unable to measure up do we need or kowtowing of peons to Shura and her Quasing alien as a religious icon? In the end, the world building and background of the aliens is the story I really wanted and there was so little of it that I just lost interest.",negative

I should have paid attention to other reviews.  Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel.  If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required.  Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents.  I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it.  Will probably just delete it.,negative

"This book reads pretty quickly. It's basically a bunch of memories told from the perspective of 3rd grader, Nenny. Some of the memories are connected, but others seem more random. The memories are short and separate like chapters.  In the beginning, there are some weird &#34;Fears&#34; dispersed in between a few of the chapters. At first I thought the fears were real and part of the story line, but quickly figured out that they were just a result of an over imaginative 9 year old. The book is set in the 80's, but most of the 80's story line is related to the current events. I was hoping for more 80's pop culture. Overall, it was enjoyable and entertaining.",positive
"I compare this pundit and her followers to what PETA members are to the left: Pure stupidity and mindless forcing of unproved beliefs upon others who have already learned that one can pick and choose their poltical beliefs based on informed decision making.<br /><br />If you like to pidgeonhole yourself as a conservative and need idiotic statistics with little fact behind them to validate your existance, then by all means buy and try to read this book.  This book replaces intelligent rational conservatives with-which one (right or left-minded) can actually discuss things, with idiotic ""dittohead"" morons who spit out the rehashed opinions of such purile pundits.  I call it NASCARification of the right.<br /><br />On the flipside the text is actually small print (unlike Bill O's...which I believe is meant for 5-year-olds.)",negative

"I'm not really sure why I thought the author was Catholic, but she isn't. She's Reformed. Which is fine. I'm not Catholic, either. I just assumed she was. Even reformed though, I would say this particular book crosses over most of those boundaries. Protestant or Catholic, this book is really just Christian. And I can absolutely appreciate that.<br />As for the actual content, this book is actually more of a companion to her book [[ASIN:0736960074 It's Great to Be a Girl!: A Guide to Your Changing Body (Secret Keeper Girl® Series)]]. You can use it without that book, but she mentions it pretty constantly. (I do not have, nor have I read the girl book.) I likely won't be using this book exactly to approach these subjects with my own daughter, but it is a really good starting point for me as far as ideas go.<br />The Eight Conversations Are: Your Body, A Purpose; Your Body, Its Practice; Your Body, God's Temple; Your Hair, A Crown; Food, Your Fuel; Exercise, Your Strength; Your Body, A Source of Life; Your Body, A Sacrifice.<br />There is also a one week Spirit Vs Body Challenge. And the Exercise and Food is kind of where she lost me a bit. And really, I bought this book for help with the puberty and sex type discussions. I have no issues helping my daughter care for her hair or wearing deodorant. I really struggle with the when can she shave, preparing for periods, and age appropriate discussions about sex. This book does kind of cover those things, but not in as much detail as I would like.",positive
"Thank goodness for beginners like me that wants to learn on their own pace, and want to have some scale practice that is more in line with the level of BEGINNER's music theory! okay, these lessons progresses as you learn more and you can tell quite quickly where your level of music theory and note reading.  And the great plus is the CD inlcuded to help you to track your progress and the tempo required!  Another plus I noticed is that as the exercises progresses, the pieces look quite interesting, and it is not just going up and down the scales.

The importance of this form of exercises cant be stressed by my many piano playing friends: it will help you to express the pieces and move around the keyboard will ease and minimum injuries.",positive
"I’ve been a fan of this author for many years, but I’m finished. Sadly, she has succumbed as so many other authors, movie stars, musicians etc have done to the temptation of trying to convert a captive audience to her personal opinions on politics. This is not why people read fiction. I’m mystified. Is any author really in a position to alienate and antagonize probably half of their base? I’m a Conservative and wading through pages and pages of repetitive snide remarks and soapbox tangents against Conservatives were enough for me to start a different book. Too bad. The Scarpetta series was a favorite, but no more.",negative

"Normally for me I am more of a thriller/mystery genre: and for a female reader, I surprised myself on how much I actually appreciated the various angles that the author illuminated in this book.  The event took place over a period of less than 12 hours: a girl that came to seek to bury the body of her brother, who is thought to be fighting for the Taliban, but none the less had attacked a US army base that lost a lot of casualties.<br /><br />The book is split into a number of chapters and each chapter reveals  the views and experiences of one person: from the girl, to the translator through the various ranks in the US army base.  I was surprised how distinctive each character was and the reason for their being there - what changed them as that 12 hours unrolled; how fatigue, lost of a colleague in a god foresaken place deposits doubts, anger, frustration and what is happening at home spills into their daily lives.<br /><br />After 50% into the book, I felt as wretched as the men there, and then the girl, was she innocent or a foe?  This book was richly developed and I highly recommend this book for those who are a little intrigued on what happens out there, whilst the rest of us are here.",positive

"Dark. 1968. 4 teens in Michigan decide to end their miserable lives in 14 days. It only gets worse for them all after that. They go from the frying pan into the fire. I just never got connected to the teens or the story. The ending wasn't a surprise, just tragic. I think it needed a lot more dialogue and I needed more perspective from Vera and Saint. That being said, 80% of the reviewers loved it.  Maybe it comes down to I found all the elements when combined so unbelievable, while taken individually I could see them all happening.",negative

It's also frustrating! The chapters are written in different point of views. Not only do you have to pay attention to which character is narrating the chapter, but what the date is for that chapter, too. I also found it sad that I didn't like any of the characters. Every time I thought that maybe a character was okay, something would occur that would change my mind. All of the main characters had some kind of mental health issue. It did manage to hold my interest and I didn't want to stop reading. It was suspenseful and entertaining.",positive

"This book is a page turner! I found it difficult to put down. I read the whole thing over a weekend. I would classify it as a thriller with some paranormal activities. I'm not much of a fan of paranormal stuff, so I could have done without that, but nonetheless, I did find it engaging and entertaining. I partially predicted one aspect of the story, but most of it was surprising. There were some twists and turns that kept me reading. I would consider reading more from this author.",positive
"The author gets the ideas of concurrency vs parallelism confused.  He is a domain expert on threading in C++ and it would be great if he got this also correct.  For example, saying that the number of cores in a machine reflects the number of threads that can truly run concurrently is getting the concept all wrong.  Concurrency is ONLY when processes may be started and ended in overlapping periods of time.  Number of cores has nothing to do with this.<br /><br />The book does cover what you expect which is when to use moves vs copies and caveats of using the thread libraries in C++ 2011.  It's a good book - buy it, just don't learn your computer science terminology from it.<br /><br />EDIT:(decided this is really at least a 4 star book after all.  The space is complex and the author really is quite practical in his addressing the topic.)",positive

It starts with the heroine kidnapping the best man and taking him to her grandparents' old cabin. She came off as very flighty and wacky.

"Someone whose a fan of Marfa, I actually lived on the Barrel Springs Ranch in the late 1960s, which is located about 30 miles outside of Marfa. I went my first and second grades in Marfa; and also lived in the the famous hotel Paisano for a couple of weeks while they were finishing our home on the ranch. Since, I have visited dozens of times, mostly staying in the Indian Lodge outside of Fort Davis. There are so many gorgeous landscapes and true and beautiful architecture, which I did not see in this book. I bought it for my 90-yr-old father, who was the manager of the Barrel Springs Ranch. He is the one who took me back at the many times to visit; then I started taking my son. I just don't get it. This wonderfully God-given country, and this book fails to portray the beauty.

"Good story about a family and the effect on the entire family when one member is unexpectedly hurt.  I thought the author did a good job of realistically portraying the emotional reactions of each family member during this life-changing event and portraying how the experience is different for each of them.  He explored the issue of survivor's guilt, including touching on risk-taking behavior.  His male characters were well developed and real but he also did a good job etching both the determination and grittiness of strong women as well as portraying their emotional vulnerability.  All-in-all, I really enjoyed this book.  The story flowed well, was taut and I wasn't disappointed at the conclusion.  I look forward to further novels from Tim Johnston.",positive
"I was carving for a good suspense-thriller: and this novel did not disappoint at all.  The characters were well developed that you became invested in their outcome, the plot was fast, roller coaster and just the amount of suspense.  A page turner.  And when I keep putting the book down every ten minutes because I couldnt take the suspense or didn't want the book to end, then I knew i was onto a good read.<br /><br />Michael/Monroe: which ever eat you can call the main character, she is one f'ing tough dragon lady, yet the brutality was released when needed and I love the sublty in which the author didn't need to detail the violence, and left it to our imagination that the job was done.  With all the bravado of the violence, the main character had depth and empathy and was amazing human.  The plot was a kidnap, but the characters were so bought alive by the author, I was part of the ride until the last page was turned.  Look forward to the next novel.",positive
"After reading the other Kay Scarpetta novels, I was looking forward to this one. Now I'm just disappointed. This book drags on eternally, never makes a point and eventually ends with more questions than answers. I thought even the character that I usually love fell flat this time. I almost think that Patricia Cornwell resented having to write another one of these novels or something. I try to not leave a one star unless I really, really hate a book, but this one is deserving. I can't recommend this book. If you want to read a novel in this series, read one of the older ones.",negative

Just Haven't Met You Yet is a refreshing and amusing book. The main plot was not worn and used. I was completely caught off guard with some of the turns it made.

I love that it wasn't predictable and kept me guessing as to what direction it was taking. I will definitely be checking into other books by Cate Woods!,positive
"This book is 35 years old and appears to be very dated.

"From the title I would have thought this book was only about Dr. DeVincentis patients but he also talks about his own animals.  I loved the array of stories and his compassion.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because the arrangement of the last story was sort of out of place. For instance, he talks about his new dog Billie after his previous dog Cotton dies. You are treated to life with Billie through the previous chapters and then in the last chapter he brings you back to how he acquired Billie.<br /><br />Other than this, the book is an enjoyable and heartwarming read.",positive
"I really struggled with this book.  It didn't delve into the characters enough for me to really feel so sad that I would fight back tears.  So, while the concept was sad, I just didn't feel it.  Matter-of-fact, at times, I felt as if the book needed to hurry up because it was too slow.  I also didn't care for the free-spirited ""60's hippy"" type aspect of the book... her being a classical musician, her family a bunch of rockers.  I didn't like how her parents were so relaxed about the sex and boyfriend sleeping over while she was clearly still a teen and in high school.  Overall, not a book I would recommend reading.",negative
"WITH MY HANDS:  POEMS ABOUT MAKING THINGS is a pleasant, beautifully illustrated children’s picture book.  It has short poems about “making” and “being a maker”, as well as about individual crafts (e.g., soap carving,  building a cardboard spaceship, origami, baking cookies, etc.).  The poems emphasize making things that are uniquely one’s own, and describe the feelings associated with creative craft activity.<br /><br />The poems usually include rhyming elements, though they aren’t slavishly rhyming.  The metre is awkward in spots in many of the poems.  (I would like this book much more if it weren’t for the metre issues.)<br /><br />The poems about specific crafts vary in quality.  For example, I think that “Knitting” misses the mark. (It would be fine if it didn’t include the trite reference to “clicking-clacking” of needles.  My knitting needles don’t click, so I wonder whether the poet has tried knitting.)<br /><br />Overall, the book deserves good marks for encouraging creativity in young children.",positive
"I must begin by stating that I have the highest regard for the wisdom contained within this reference—and that only serves to make the publisher’s poor choices for its physical presentation exponentially worse! It would be impossible to find a more comprehensive and thorough volume on cooking and the content of the book from cover to cover cannot be faulted. But all the invaluable information within its hallowed pages becomes less than worthless due to the extremely reader unfriendly formatting! I purchase cookbooks to use, not to sit on a coffee table as decor! Publishers elected to print this edition in too small font which is difficult to read under ideal circumstances and next to impossible to follow if actively attempting to follow a recipe. They also chose to widen the pages which would not be a major issue, except that the paper is of a thin, insubstantial thickness. This is a book that should be sturdy enough to use for a lifetime of frequent use! I would rather pay more for a functional version broken into multiple volumes if necessary than to be stuck with this massive paperweight! Honestly, to print a reference of this caliber in such an inferior and unusable manner borders on sacrilege! Irma must be rolling over in her grave!",negative
"I keep following this series in hopes it is going to become more connected and coherent , but it's not. With this book it's become more disjointed than ever. It's like the author wanted this to be a series but couldn't quite weave it together. In this book we start with two characters that were fairly minor characters in an earlier book--where their actions were confusing--and now they appear as major characters, but we have gone back to an earlier time in some effort to explain who they were.  Just did not flow for me.  Each book ends with some cliff hanger, then the next book starts as if the cliff hanger never happened.  That even is the case within this book. One of the heroes ends up taken hostage, and the other vows to save him, then when they meet it's as if that drama never happened. what was the point?  The books are still pretty well written=I just wish there was more coherence between them. i'm losing interest in going any farther.",negative

"i am a big fan of Amy Tan's writing and i always learn little bit about humanity with its deep pain and the rise of the spirit, and Chinese culture.  The setting of this book is 1910's and into 1926: based on the main character, Violet and all her variations as her life changed from one form to another: always seeking to be loved and something she may not know she would be seeking.  I think this was a challenging/ambitious concept to get across in the book that towards the end, the details were pushed through little too fast or I didn't get the depth of betrayal that I thought might have been there.  If you love Amy Tan then you will read this book, but it is not one of her best in terms of getting my heart string pulled!  [it will probably make a great movie as there are so many angles and 'lives' that the main character had in the short span of her life!  I still had a great read and learnt a lot about women's life (for the not so rich class or if your life took a few bad turns and what they had to put up with) .. Amy Tan still delivered a great novel of immense detail about life in china and the courtesan world - very intriguing.",positive
"I used this book to hike two trails this last weekend and it was very helpful for me (1st time to Shenandoah).  The pocket size was awesome to bring along on the hikes.  Its very light.  I also used it to pick which day hikes I wanted to do.  I used it a couple times during the hikes to read the descriptions and make sure I was still going the right way as many different trails intercross as some point.

This is a good book for someone who has never picked up a digital camera or an SLR camera before (if you're used to a normal 35mm camera and need to learn both digital and SLR at once you'll be overwhelmed and this can help you).  The pictures are good and the explanation is simple enough, but if you've used a digital or an SLR you can pick most of this information up without a book.

"Compelling, full of heart, a history of pain born of systematic genocide over centuries and the woe born in the loss in both survivor and empathetic ear. I bought this book for my mother, an Ojibwe of White Earth, Minnesota, after I was midway through my own copy. May the echoes of wisdom enclosed within these pages move her spirit as it has my own.  Though I am of mixed blood, I can feel my people close when the voice of Dan reaches through Nerburn's words time and again. Thank you.",positive

"I thought I would learn from the author and be inspired by his story but this was a let down. He's just a lawyer with a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants style and rather reckless with himself and his life. Nice, quirky person but not someone to exemplify.",negative
"I have used several other Japanese kanji study methods in the past, including the Tuttle flashcards and Memorize the Kanji,  so was looking forward to the challenge of a new way of learning and remembering the core kanji.  I liked that the characters were grouped by common elements in thematic units…  interestingly, I shared this with some of my Japanese students and they thought the method / kanji was rather difficult.  I have not had time to sit down and seriously study with this book as I have been more focused on basic grammar and learning vocabulary, but my next challenge will be to increase my  productive and receptive knowledge of the kanji.  I feel like the method presented in this book will be successful for me  where other methods were not.",positive
"Time is finite and by squandering it, we destroy the present and rob our future. For example, if we waste time on tasks or experiences or friends that are not important, we could have reallocated it to spending time with our spouse, on self-improvement, or excercising which may be more important and might enhance our future (or increase life expectancy as excerising might do).<br /><br />The author examines many ways in which we could waste time and makes a compelling case as to why it is important to constantly re-evaluate where we put our effort by asking outselves powerful questions (PQs).<br /><br />The messages within is excellent except for the  vulnerabilities assessment (starting on Page 151). Most of the questions did not apply to me, so I answered them as if they did apply to me. For instance, the questions assume you have a spouse and children.  I believe they need to be redesigned to accommodate everyone. My score blantly missed two truths about me and it is possible the wording and the fact that many situations are not taken into consideration, caused it to be skewed.<br /><br />In summary this is a wonderful book. It would have received 5 stars from me, if it were not for the vulnerabilities assessment that I feel needs improvement.",positive

"This is another cute American Girl kit. The kit comes with 2 doll sized t-shirts. There are some stickers and stencils for decorating the shirts. The book shows how to decorate the shirts. In addition to using the stickers, it shows how to make felt decorations on the shirts and how to paint on them. The stickers aren't really reusable since they loose their stickiness. If you paint on the shirt or glue the felt to them, then the shirts can't be decorated again.  Younger readers may need some adult help, as mentioned on the back of the kit.",positive
"This is a challenging puzzle book. There are a variety of puzzle types such as crossword, logic, word search, codes, and more.

"Wow.  You follow a friend, Helen, who accepts the responsibility of taking care of a friend, Nicola, for three weeks who has cancer and plans to undergo an alternative treatment.<br /><br />In such a small book, the author delivered the biggest punch of one of life's toughest moments: taking care of someone who is ill.  The story is delivered in a fast pace, but dont be deceived by the small volume of the book; the emotional roller coaster ride is just as real and renching for loved ones and as well as the one who is ill.<br /><br />For those who are/have been caretakers, the story is all too familiar.  For the person who is ill, the reference to denial and alternative medicines is all to real in keeping the hope alive for a miracle cure.<br /><br />A lovely book that provides an insight into one of life's toughest experiences; but told with love, wit, family and friendship.  Sometimes, you have to reach to the most unlikley people who will help you through the toughest times in life: it may not always be found in the traditional family!  I found myself unable to put the book down as the author very quickly pulled me into these character's lives.",positive
So far so good. My second grader is on the letter U so far. There are only 1 or 2 letters so far that I didn’t care for the style(as in it wasn’t how I was taught cursive). He asked me if he could learn cursive and this is what I gave him. He likes it!,positive

The only thing more surprising was the fact that so many of the reviewers made such glowing comments--although they sure were all EXTREMELY similar in length, content, style, heck-even punctuation! What's going on here? Did the author give extra credit points to his students for positive Amazon feedback? I wonder.....<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing of merit in this book. Do yourself a favor and pass. You've read a better written version at least five times already.",negative
"This is the way that cookbooks should be, a beautiful picture for every recipe. For design, this is a fantastic book.  Unfortunately, I didn't find as many inspiring meal ideas as I was hoping for.  One of the biggest problems is that my partner and her kids are vegetarians, which is actually why I turn to a lot of cookbooks looking for recipes I can tweak or replace meat.  There are definitely vegetarian options or easily tweaked meals, but compared to other Southern Living cookbooks, this one had the fewest mouthwatering inspirations.  Still worth a place on my cookbook shelf though.<br /><br />I do have to say that one recipe stuck out so much was the biscuit and gravy bake.  Biscuits and Gravy is a southern culinary weakness of mine, and that was the first recipe I made, replacing the sausage with veggie sausage crumbles.",positive
"I am reading the books out of order, bu it do es not spoil the enjoyment. This is the first in the King and Maxwell series, which lays out the back ground of both main characters.  Useful, and in between that, you get the history that replays it self that brings these 2 characters into play.  The books and plot get bether with each book.  This book is more an introduction, but the story was still good...get another one, and you will see what i mean!",positive
"I heard an NPR discussion about the Anthropocene recently and was amazed at the controversy surrounding the terminology.  I was especially intrigued that the rather unglamorous geologists find themselves as the key holders to confirm or deny that we are in a new era.  So, I was excited to see this book, not fully understanding what I was getting into.<br /><br />What I did get, I ended up really liking.  It is a herky jerky and jumping ride through a bunch of related topics.  Each topic (e.g. population bomb, climate, resource availability... all over really) is treated in a chapter that reads like an informative essay.  It is kind of a wild ride keeping up with the topics, but the threads keep building under the theme.  Each chapter is filled with thought provoking, and at least for now, amazingly timely information.<br /><br />In the end, you get a very good overview of the history that brought us to the anthropocene and a good list of it's implications. It was a decently easy read, although I am well steeped and a fan of this kind of subject matter.  I'm glad I read it.",positive
"I tried to read this book on multiple occasions.  I never made it past the first dozen or so pages. I was bored to tears.  That is something i never thought I'd say about a Paul Theroux book.

I didn't want to know more about him, I didnt' want to hear his story.  I don't  know...perhaps the book gets better as it moves along but I didn't have a desire to find out.  I donated my copy to the local Goodwill.  I hope the person who buys it has better luck with it and enjoys it.",negative

"You know you don't like a book when a review of it (the one from Frank Antix, the person before me) was better than the actual book lol.<br /><br />Bottled, in a nutshell, is about unlikeable characters doing nothing to redeem themselves while doing horrible crap to other unlikeable characters. That's literally the story. And this ""millennial"" (like most) is over reading stories about a-hole characters who serve no purpose. Especially when the accompanying illustrations are simply not good.<br />The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the main character dumps her boyfriend in one of the most satisfying ways. Sure, I saw it coming - but that doesn't mean I wasn't happy when it actually happened lol. I also chuckled at the last 2 pages when the mom realized what her daughter was saying to her. That scene had more character development and nuance than the entirety of the book!",negative

"In the last two years I’ve become interested in the years between the World Wars - fiction and nonfiction, especially the Weimar Republic era. The setting, a rural area and not being in Berlin, made me eager to read this book.<br /><br />First the good: I really liked Fallada’s writing style - rapid-fire storytelling, often driven by quick and energetic dialog that forced me to concentrate to “keep up.” I liked that. The descriptions of the town, its people and their relationships and conflicts were also well-written and engaging. I have a few other Fallada novels on my list, and I will give them a read.<br /><br />The not-so-good: The first 50% of the book was tight and exciting, with a good building of the coming conflict within the town. But the almost overwhelming number of main and secondary characters (the Dramatis Personae did help!), and the many sub-plots and little intrigues got to be a bit much during the book’s second half. And the conclusion - after so much conniving, chicanery and double-crossing  within the community - was a bit of a fizzle, flat and disappointing. At almost 600 pages, it seemed bloated, and maybe 100-150 pages too long.",negative
"I understand the point of this. It was trying to be silly and show that daddies could not be perfect too. The problem is it just went way too far. Most of book is showing our inept and faulty daddies are. My husband really didn't like it when he read it to the kids. It's one thing showing them as silly, but just giving a basic run down of all their faults isn't great, especially for little kids who really look up to their dads. In trying to be silly, it ended up just being insulting. We would not recommend this.",negative
"This summer, my 9 year old nephew is coming to spend time with us. He's expressed a lot of interest in all things geeky. My husband is a programmer and I thought this would be a good resource for him while he's visiting. After looking at it, I've decided it's too advanced for him. He's a strong reader, but it's more geared toward an older reader. I showed it to my 22 year old son, who is studying Information Technology at college. He found it interesting. He's way past Scratch, which the first section of the book is devoted to, but the Python and Web Technologies sections cover a lot of what he's learning right now. There's lots of great information in it. It's presented with lots of diagrams and illustrations. My husband and son both like the layout of the book and find it to be a good resource.",positive
"Was this really supposed to be a romance? Where is the romance? Okay, I have read a lot of previous Coulter novels and usually they are pretty thrilling. This one? Not so much. I really hoped this would be as good as the previous novels I had read by this author, but this one just fell flat for me. The characters were cookie cutters from previous books, the dialogue was silly and never on point and the story line kept changing directions without warning. I think I would have to recommend you pass on this one.",negative

"I have been on a reading binge of Mark Edwards books for the last week or so, and I have to say, I was beginning to think everything he wrote was gold, until this book. Out of all of the books I have read by this author, this one was surprisingly bland, disappointing and ridiculous. I couldn't even find redemption in liking the main character.<br /><br />I thought I'd get this review out of the way first, before reviewing the other works I've recently read by him. I thought this book was awful, but please take my advice and do not begin with this book. Read his other stuff first and you can see what a great author he truly is. I'm not sure what happened with this book--perhaps a good idea gone wrong, but it certainly wasn't for me. That being said, it will not stop me from highly recommending and enjoying his other books.",negative
"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of a mix between ""Extras"" by Scott Westerfeld and ""Matched"" by Ally Condie. It did has its own flair, but it had many of the futuristic and political set-ups of those two books. It is a futuristic dystopia book, which is something I love. It is apparently the first in a series, but it is a complete story in and of itself. (Which anyone who reads teen fiction knows is not always the case with these new series type books.)<br />All in all, I like this book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.<br />A note to parents: There are a couple curse words in the book, but it is not overwhelming or even frequent. (There are maybe two or three curse words.) There is also mention of teen sexuality. The make-out scenes are more awkward than anything, but they are there. (And it is just rolling around kissing sort of thing.) I do wish she would have abbreviated these ""scenes"" to be more vague and less awkward to read, but they are explicit or graphic.",positive
"DK Eyewitness Travel Guides are my favorite. I like the layout of them. This guide starts out with some reasons for visiting Ireland. Then it introduces the various regions of the country.

This guide does not include a laminated pullout map like some of the DK guidebooks do. The size makes it easy to travel with. Overall, it's a good travel book and has me planning another dream trip!",positive

"This book makes for an easy and quick read about Jeremy Lin, who recently has been in the news. There is a story to tell here, worth telling because I think it does provide a feel-good human interest portrait. Here are some points which I take from the book...<br />1. Jeremy's maternal grandparents came to the US from Taiwan. His mom enrolled at Old Dominion College in VA and studied computer science where she met his dad. They married then moved to Purdue U. in Indiana so the dad could get his PhD and where mom got introduced to a Christian fellowship group there. Then moved to LA, then Florida, finally settling in Palo Alto, CA, parents working in Silicon Valley.<br />2. Jeremy's dad had become a basketball junkie and got Jeremy involved with youth basketball teams in Palo Alto, though academics would always come first.<br />3. Parents each 5'6"", so Jeremy would drink lots of milk and take calcium supplements, eventually reaching 6ft in HS and as a Sr. being a point guard, team won Division II CA state championship, Jeremy being named to the CA All-State team.<br />4. Received no Div. I college scholarships (his skills don't show up in statistics), but was accepted to Harvard and went there with some financial aid.<br />5 Led Harvard to a 21-8 senior season, growing to 6ft 3+ inches. Golden State Warrior owner knew Jeremy form his youth basketball days, so gave him a 2-year contract, then claimed off waivers by the Knicks where he met success after Carmelo Anthony was injured and the Knicks had a guard problem and Carmelo suggested giving Jeremy a chance to play. Then Jeremy created headlines while maintaining devotion to Christianity, similar to Tim Tebow of football.<br />So, a nice true story.",positive

"This is not your typical romance at all. The main character is a recent widow. She drinks a lot so she doesn't have to feel anything. There were times when I didn't really like her, but other times I wanted her to find happiness. The hero of the story has his own problems and issues. He's a Hollywood actor and just as screwed up as she is.  In addition to excessive drinking, there's a lot of swearing - especially the &#34;f&#34; word. There's some sexual content, but it's not too graphic. Overall,  I thought it was well written and engaging. I started reading a couple of chapters a day, but then on the third day, I couldn't put it down.",positive

Overall, I would recommend this title to teens and adult fans of YA.",positive

"I have been a fan of Jane Goodall for a long time.  This book demonstrates how involved she is with conservation and her quest for knowledge regarding the various species of animals, plants, fish, and insects on our planet.<br /><br />This text highlights just some of the animals that are or were:<br />- extinct in nature<br />- almost extinct in nature<br />- those making a comeback in nature<br />- those that were thought extinct (the Lazarus Syndrome) but have since been rediscovered<br />- etc., etc.<br /><br />Some of the animals (and other rarities) you will become acquainted with are the Pere David's deer, Sumatran Rhino, some Asian Vultures, Panamanian Golden Frog, Crimson Spider Orchid (flower--picture only, no story), Coelacanth (fish), Lord Howe's Island phasmid (stick insect), the Tahina Palm (plant), etc., etc.<br /><br />The latest conservation efforts are presented in short book report form for each of the many extinct or almost extinct animals, plants, fish, and insects. The only reason I rated the book four stars is because you feel you are reading individual book reports instead of an engaging flowing narrative.  However, I am not sure this book could have been written any other way.<br /><br />A website was mentioned as an extension to this book but no website address was given.  As of today I could not find such a site during a Google search.<br /><br />""Hope for Animals and their World..."" is definitely an enducational read for someone interested in the natural world.",positive
"Judging by toc alone, this would be a wonderful book, comprehensive, indepth, with examples. the author knows what to cover, or the topic of interest.<br /><br />Diving into it, many examples starts with no clue what it is for, what is it suppose to do, and what is expected output. Each example are broken down into pieces, sprinkled with sparse explanations, often doesn't help much. Come on, make some efforts, both Manning and Oreily do far better job on formatting code with pointed comments!!! This inflated the whole book into 700+ pages.<br /><br />On top of that, there are places I feel deserved a much greater discussion (such as concurrency), the book merely scratch the surface, this is true for many other topics as well. All in all, a big disappointment.",negative

"Joy.  I've found another angst trick that authors might use.  How many more authors will try the same?  Honestly, even one is too many.<br /><br />This tale is an isekai where the main character is somehow torn from his happy life on Earth and dropped into a world of beast-kin, magic and lots of conflict and betrayal.  Its a tale as old as time in a way.  Sadly, while the foundation is simple, this author manages to munge up the tale by having the hero be contrary with people who have knowledge and yet also be far too stupid to live.  Heck, his first harem member calls him Idiot for a while because he doesn't listen and likes to stubbornly argue with her even when doing so can be dangerous.  (and gets them in at least one fight when they are delayed long enough to get caught.)<br /><br />I hated the MC because of his stubborn stupidity, and as always that made me dislike the plot and the rest of the tale.  Sadly, it was clear that his attitude was an attempt by the author to make him seem like a bit less of a jerk than the usual harem fantasy male leads who bounce from bed to bed without any remorse or emotional tie to their victims.  Here he did have some romance, but its buried until teenage style angst due to morals that clearly didn't play in the world.  Yes, some men might fight for their old school morals, but honestly, I think most men dropped into such a world are going to realize ""When in Rome.....""<br /><br />I gave up due to the angst.  That's the last I can say here.",negative

"This is the sixth book in the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series.  This time, however, Gamache is not in the quaint village of Three Pines but rather in Quebec City, where he has gone to try and recover from an horrific incident in his recent past.  Louise Penny's description of Old Quebec in winter paints a perfect picture of the city's charm and beauty.  For those of us who have been there and  know and love the ""Old World "" city, the author perfectly captures the sights, sounds and even tastes and smells of Quebec City.  The characters in ""Bury Your Dead"" are also well realized and believable thanks to Ms. Penny's talent for character development.  The character of Armand Gamache continues to grow; ""Bury Your Dead"" explores his weaknesses as well as his strengths.<br /><br />There are actually three separate story lines that unfold simultaneously (one in flash backs) in this book: a murder in Quebec City, where the Chief Inspector has no jurisdiction but agrees to assist with the investigation; the reinvestigation of a murder in Three Pines by Gamache's trusted colleague Jean Guy Beauvoir; and a sinister plot involving domestic terrorism.  The complexity and layers of the book are demanding of the reader, but in the end the effort is worth it.",positive
"Ever felt like there's a nagging voice in your head? Well, if you're Penelope Thornton-McClure, that ""voice"" is the very dead private dick Jack Shepard, who hasn't had a body since getting iced in 1949. Jack haunts Pen's bookstore Buy the Book and aids her in solving mysteries; in The Ghost and the Femme Fatale, the small town of Quindicott has its hands full with its first-ever Film Noir festival. Leading lady Hedda Geist, out of the limelight for decades after the grisly death of her studio boss Irving Vreen, is scheduled to make an appearance, but her first return to the stage is nearly her last.<br /><br />Penelope, her aunt, and Jack are hot on the trail when festival guests turn up dead, leading them to uncover a decades-old tale of steamy affairs and cold-blooded murder. Snappy pacing, humor, and even a touch of romance between the hard-boiled Jack with his ""iron jaw"" and Penelope (the two ""time travel"" through dreams in order to investigate). Jack's language is pure pulp fiction / noir, and the touches from the 1940s were nice. This is the same author who pens the Coffeehouse Mysteries, and I loved the take-charge Pen, the sexy Jack, and the quirky cast of supporting characters. The mystery included enough twists and turns that I didn't even suspect the real villain until the shocking (and appropriately noirish) finale. This was the first book in the series that I read (it's number four), and I can't wait to devour the further adventures of Jack and Pen (I'd like to see their romance heat up!).",positive

You couldn't really buy into emotional trauma because the main character's  initial romantic relationship on which the book revolved upon wasn't really explored or defined.  Because you didn't really get more than a glimpse into their relationship it was difficult to buy into her feelings of loss.<br /><br />As the book moved forward it lost its traction and you weren't really sure what the point of several stories within the story was.  It felt scattered.  The final romance felt thrown onto the end to have a happy ending.  Yet, it didn't feel happy, it felt awkward.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a book she would either read again or pass on to someone else to read.",negative

"Like reading a collection of personal blogs, written without any soul or insight. What insight I did glean was that the author mixed in a social circle, and lived a lifestyle, that had little meaning or depth. I am sure that is not true. I chalk it up to this being a debut for the author and those memoir skills have not had a chance to be cultivated. I won't even touch on the socio-economic racial aspects of the story where the author strikes out on awareness or empathy. Having lived in Tampa Florida for the last 20 years I was really looking forward to reading a memoir of an author from Tallahassee.<br /><br />Excellent book club potential",negative

"In KNIT VINTAGE, well-known designers Madeline Weston and Rita Taylor present more than 20 classic knitwear designs, updated for modern tastes from designs originally published in the 1930's, 1940's, and 1950's.  Most of the designs are for body-hugging tops, like the one in the cover photo, but there are also designs for a ""Wallis Simpson"" cardigan, a Tyrolean-flower-patterned cardigan (intarsia), and some very pretty cabled and lacy twinsets.  All of the designs have a definite ""vintage"" look--and you probably won't want to knit them unless you have a taste for ""retro"" clothing.<br /><br />The full-color knitwear photographs by Debi Treloar are beautiful, and the written-out instructions seem to be clear (as I would expect from Weston and Taylor).  Nearly all of the designs (sweaters, stockings, skirt and top, beret) are knit in fine yarns, on 3mm to 4.5mm needles (US 2 to US 7), in gauges of 6 to 8 stitches to the inch.  This means a lot of knitting, especially for the twinsets!  You will probably need at least intermediate knitting skills to knit the body-hugging designs, because they have a lot of shaped increases.  Because of the limited appeal of this pattern collection, I rate KNIT VINTAGE at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive
"When I received this I seriously thought there was a mix up.  What kind of Master Gamer guide is this supposed to be ?This is total garbage from the extremely thin cover to cover....book that is a so called guide with download hints and very few hints on how to beat the game.  Had I know that this was going to be this bad I would have never bought it.  Please do not be fooled with the shiny cover.  This is a super thin book with very little to offer,  you can however believe them when it says ""unofficial"" because no one would sign on for this joke.  I love the game Spyro but this is no Spyro at all.  The few hints to play are laughable, the pictures are ...don't get me started.  If I could rate this any lower I would.  The UPS shipping with a signature no less is also sad.... after i read the book which takes like 5 mins I was sorry it was not stolen lol thats how much of a crock this is.<br />Buy it at your own risk.

"Bought this book thinking it was a  who done it or a race against time. It was not. It was a let's make everyone feel good about themselves and all be happy book. Not that their is anything wrong with that. Just not my cup of tea. That said, the story is slow, everything is drawn out including how many times a day they have tea yet the characters are likeable except of course the one that your suppose to hate.

"We have a few bucket list destinations we are trying to schedule in the next few years and China is high on the list.  This book did a good, but not perfect, job of getting our dreams going.  I think we could have used a more general, less detailed book to start with.  I think it will become a good reference later, but right now we could use more photos and more focus on the sites and less on lodging and food.  Although, I did like the basic logistics pages, when they were not in error.  I feel like we have a good idea of some logistical issues and such.<br /><br />This book did seem to have more photos than the average Fodors which was nice, but this might not be the best book if you are looking at broad strokes.  I find Fodor's better when you know the cities you will be going to and you want to make reservations to stay and dine.  That makes this a great book in your library, but perhaps, not the best stand alone.",positive
"This book really irked me. I hate that so many romance novels use the dumb-naive-bimbo-meets-stronger-older-man thing as their premise. Please! The so called hero of this book is a stalker and the woman at the heart of the story is a brainless twit. Not saying much considering she is supposed to be an early childhood educator.<br /><br />I wanted like this book as there are many Sandra Brown titles that are worth reading. Maybe it was because this was a reprint from the 80's. I don't know, but this book just never made it onto my radar. I couldn't find the book entertaining as it was just to silly to get into on any serious level. There are far better romances out there.",negative

"The author, of Greek heritage, goes to Greece to better understand how the nation will cope with the effects of the 2008 financial crash on it and its membership in the EU.<br /><br />He sees modern Greece as corrupt, with its government, via kickbacks, bribes, etc, providing easy living for all government workers and their descendants. Greeks don't see this as bad, just making up for brutal treatment under the Ottoman Empire. Plus, taxes go underpaid.<br /><br />Kind of a paradox, a nation as a birthplace of democracy, science and reason, now a dysfunctional government and people who expect to be rewarded.<br /><br />Meanwhile, those with ties to the government do pretty well, while those tied to the private economy either do well and move money out of Greece, or suffer.<br /><br />Greece probably cooked the books to get accepted  to the EU and cannot meet reforms because the nation lives on corruption.<br /><br />Also, past NAZI occupation of Greece during WW2 still evokes passion, such they see Germany as just the latest evil incarnation of the past, via the austerity wanted in proposed reforms. Talk of WW2 reparations still are prevalent.<br /><br />The author uses lots of interviews to paint his picture of recent Greece and I recommend the book to better understand Greece in relation to the current financial situation.",positive
"I do not understand this book. It is so very dark. It is a counting picture book, presumably for children, yet it talks about funerals, prison line ups, people getting hurt, people leaving and never coming back, lost toys. I had to skip over half of it when reading it to my child. I have never seen a counting book with death and criminals in it. It is completely inappropriate for the age it seems like it is for...<br /><br />The worst part is the concept is okay, basically saying that people feel different things. But the darkness is baffling. Unless you are getting this for a teenager (who isn't going to read a counting book) I do not know who this is aimed for.",negative

"I love Spanish, Columbian, Ecuadorian, etc. cuisine and this cookbook is a great compilation of recipes with the ""flavor of Spain."" There is a small introduction into Spanish cooking (the food staples and the culture) and the rest of the book is all recipes.  I found 27 recipes that I would definitely make.<br /><br />Most of the recipes require a moderate amount of time and ingredients. They are not quick recipes but not long either. I decided to make the Spanish Potato Salad and it was delicious. The only caveat is that one must be careful of the cooking times. The recipe called for 25 to 30 minutes to cook the potatoes and carrots and I thought that was a bit much. I cooked them for 18-20 minutes and the potatoes were overcooked and almost mashed. Therefore, it is important to just check the consistency of the food ingredient when cooking to make sure it is not being overcooked. Nevertheless, I loved the results despite the less than firm potatoes.<br /><br />I do wish this book had more photos. There is only one photo at the beginning of each chapter and it does not say what recipe that is a photo of. This is the only reason I rated this 4 stars. Otherwise, I feel this is a great complement to my extensive cookbook library.",positive
"I ordered this book over one year ago because of the rave reviews.  I tried two recipes in it.  The lemon pound cake was dense, too lemony and just all around not to my or my boyfriend's liking.  The vanilla cupcakes were so, so.  I make exceptional desserts from recipes in other books and articles and people have raved about them. I also follow instructions precisely.  However, in this case I know that the recipes are not good (at least to me) and the baker is not the problem.  I guess I just don't have a taste for the recipes in this book. I am almost afraid to try another recipe because the two others have been so disappointing.<br /><br />Perhaps this book is for someone who has different tastes from the norm.  However, I like decadent desserts.  So far I'm thoroughly disappointed and wished I hadn't purchased the book.",negative
"This is a fast paced and exciting thriller. A young small town cop works with an older ex-detective with a past to hunt down a serial killer. The book starts out strong with lots of details and background information. We don't even meet the ex-detective until almost half way through the story. Then the rest of the book is spent solving the crime/finding the serial killer. I felt that the second half deserved a little more attention. It seemed rushed a bit. In fact, everything was wrapped up rather quickly.  From start to finish it took about a day to read it. Overall, it was entertaining and I did enjoy it. It kept me engaged and interested.",positive
"FALL OF ANGELS (AN INSPECTOR REDFYRE MYSTERY) introduces Barbara Cleverly’s new detective, John Redfyre.  He’s sort of a cross between Inspector Lynley and Inspector Morse, because he’s a well-connected, educated policeman assigned to a university town (Cambridge).  Redfyre is unique, though, because his series is set in Cambridge of the 1920s.  Be warned that this is a “feminist” novel—the plot centers on a group of strong women who are working to achieve true equality after the 1918 grant of limited women’s suffrage in England.<br /><br />In the novel, a female trumpeter (a highly controversial choice of musical instrument!) is nearly killed by a suspicious fall down the steep steps leading from the choir loft at the St. Barnabas College Chapel.  Redfyre is in attendance at the trumpeter’s ill-fated performance, and cordons off the area near the steps, treating it as a crime scene.  Soon enough, he discovers a second attempted murder of the trumpeter; and actual murders of various women who are loosely connected with the trumpeter follow shortly.<br /><br />The novel is well-written, with fully developed characters and solid historical background.  I like Inspector Redfyre every bit as much as Joe Sandilands.  The plot of this novel leaves something to be desired, though.  It’s highly complex, with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and it has something of a surprise ending.  However, the story loses its momentum and begins to peter out in the last 75 or so pages, so that the ending is unsatisfying.  This is a good mystery/thriller, but it’s definitely not Cleverly’s best.",positive

"Horribly predictable. Humans will ruin and kill whenever and whatever they can. Including themselves.

Living near Florida's NASA base and having read science fiction since I could read even I know man's greatest enemy in space is fire so why was an entire habitat developed and designed with fireplaces?<br />And when you have a chance at participating in what may be one of mankind's greatest adventures who do you send? The best and the brightest even the second best? No, you stock the space habitat with criminals, corrupt guards and the flotsam of society, just in case it's a trick.<br />Much of the story was easy to predict from the corruption to the invasion of the other nearby habitat.

"I really love dogs. I have four of them and they capture my heart in a way this book didn't. I really thought I would love this as the central focus is about a dog, but it just didn't turn out that way.

I gave up a little over half way.",negative
"I'm not sure if I missed the boat somehow, but I really didn't like this book.  As a translated novel from Dutch, I wondered if I missed something of a cultural nature?  The novellas are really a wandering tale of a young boy and his neighbor ""friends"" in their day to day young lives.  Their days are filled with cruelty and death to bugs and animals, bullying of those they deem less than them, and molestation by strange adults.  It seemed that the author was trying to show ""childhood"" as seen from the point of view of a child, but it seemed too dark and distracting to hold on to.  I didn't care much for any of the characters and was, in fact, disturbed about what the main characters might do as adults--was that the point?  If these ""children"" continue with experiences such as this, it made me wonder if it's trying to explain how exposure to the grime of life can really change the trajectory of a child's life?  I don't know.  Just not a fun, nor a good read, in my opinion.",negative

"This is a very thin book that's a very quick read. I read this in a little over one hour.  It's about one woman's quest to find out where her cat Tibby was for the 5 weeks he went missing written in a very lighthearted and silly way.<br /><br />She uses different methods to track down his previous whereabouts such as a camera, GPS, psychic, animal communicator, etc.  The story is both funny at times and very silly at other times.  The book ends with a message of how we often think of technology first before thinking of a simpler way of finding out what we want.<br /><br />I did enjoy this story.  However, based on the title I thought it was a book about a lost cat whose owner uses GPS technology to find her cat--not so.  Instead she uses this and other technology and methods AFTER her cat returns home.<br /><br />I think many cat lovers can relate to the author's feelings and enjoy this lighthearted read. I also think some young adults would have fun reading this.",positive

"This is not my usual genre, but I was willing to give it a try. The first 100 pages moved very slowly. There were times that I thought I was going to quit, but I trudged on. Things did pick up and I found it difficult to put down during the last 100 pages. Since I haven't read a lot of books set in the late 1890's, I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It did give me sort of a Sherlock Holmes feel to it. The language was a little frustrating because it was very wordy and dragged out which I attribute to the niceties and formalities of the time period. This did cause me to skim at times, but then I would miss something and have to go back and reread some. The subject was a bit supernatural, but interesting. Overall, I did enjoy it, though I'm not eager to dip into the genre again anytime soon.",positive

"TRIAL ON MOUNT KOYA: A HIRO HATTORI NOVEL (A SHINOBI MYSTERY) is the sixth “Hiro Hattori” mystery, and it definitely does NOT work as a standalone.  As a first-time series reader, I initially thought that the novel was a bad translation from a Japanese original. (It isn’t--the author is a California attorney who has a degree in Asian studies from Tufts University.)<br /><br />The opening chapters have so many unfamiliar foreign words and names (e.g., nyonindo, koya, Myo-in, shinobi, ryu, Iga, and many more), and so much description of special features of Japanese mountain temple interiors and exteriors, I couldn’t find the story that was supposedly there.  The mystery of why two mismatched travellers (a Jesuit priest and a Shinobi assassin) would be traveling together to deliver some sort of life-and-death message, while carrying a cat named “Gato” (seriously!) in a wicker basket, wasn’t enough to sustain my interest.<br /><br />To further complicate matters, this is a historical mystery series--a series which attempts to “remain faithful to Shingon Buddhist architecture, doctrine, life, and practice as it existed on (Mount) Koya during the sixteenth century.”  Lacking a college degree in Asian studies, I cannot offer any opinion on how well the author has succeeded in portraying 16th century Shingon practice in Japan.",negative

"I have read a lot of Sophie Kinsella's books over the years. I have liked her newer books, but I loved her older ones. I love this newest title. It was very fast paced and once I found the time to actually sit down and read without distractions, I couldn't put it down. I read most of the 400+ pages in one sitting. The story is about a married couple faced with some problems with their marriage. Most of the problems revolve around the relationship becoming stagnant and boring. They decide to shake things up a bit with random surprises. I found that the whole story actually surprised me! I thought I knew what direction it was going in, but I was completely wrong. The chapters were a little long which made it difficult when I needed to find a stopping place, but that's minor. I really liked the characters, especially some of the secondary ones.

Eventually I stopped using it because the food was predictable and the presentation (important to me) was less than desirable.  Recently I purchased a basic slow cooker to replace the previous one which died, possibly from boredom.  I was overjoyed to see ""The French Slow Cooker"" by Michele Scicolone.  This cookbook author has taken ordinary ingredients and combined them in new, flavorful  ways.  My  attempt at ""Sunday Roast Chicken with Potatoes, Lemon, and Thyme"" was a success and enjoyed by all.  I religiously followed the recipe until I was directed to squeeze the lemon halves into the juices.  I found the juices to be tart enough so thickened the mixture without the additional lemon juice called out in the recipe.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and the thick potato slices kept their shape.<br /> I have bookmarked several  other ""must try"" recipes from this collection and am looking forward to enjoying the French flair these recipes provide.  The recipes are not complicated so they should not intimidate the average cook.  The Tips and Techniques at the beginning of the cookbook should be a great help to the novice cook.

"I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this book. However, it was an enjoyable read. The author elaborates on how Palm Beach came to be with railroad magnate Henry Flagler who bought up property there, built there, and brought the railroad to Palm Beach and elsewhere.<br /><br />Over the course of the story, all the movers and shakers who frequented Palm Beach and their opulent residences, architects, and various scandals are mentioned and elaborated upon.<br /><br />Eventually Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach's most lavish mansion, was built by Marjorie Merriweather Post. She left this to the government in her will but then it was given back to the estate because the government felt it was too expensive to own. Eventually, Donald Trump purchased this for a song and it is where he periodically resides now. In essence, what Ms. Post wanted she got but not in the way she expected.<br /><br />I found this book to be incredibly interesting.

The majority of the book is variations on Caucasian, predominately females. I believe there is a single Asian individual as well.

"I'll be honest, I picked up this book thinking it was something else entirely. It is actually a book about homesteading, not homemaking. There is a difference between those two in my head. I am a homemaker, not a homesteader. I do not grow my own food. Yes, I make quite a bit from scratch, but the ingredients are purchased, not grown or raised by me. However, I did really enjoy this book. The first half was an eye opener into our consumer culture. The second half are the how-to's of making a go of homesteading and the values common among homesteaders. The information is presented thoroughly without talking in circles. It is well written.<br /><br />I found this book to be worth my time reading it. While I do not plan to become a homesteader, I did take many things to heart. It was a great reminder to be happy with what we have and not continually strive to have more. (The happiness isn't in the more, it is in having what you need and enjoying what you do.) My needs are met. I've got time to spend with my family. I'm a very blessed and fortunate woman. I am also trying to buy more locally. It also (along with a blog post by Mavis) made me rethink my decision to insist on traditional health insurance.<br /><br />If you're extremely mainstream, you may want to skip this book for now. But if you're already thinking about quality of life over making money and helping your neighbors, this book will be a good read for you, even if you can't or won't make the leap into full homesteading.",positive
"So little is written about Burma and I appreciate the author taking this huge political risk to reveal so much history about the country. I found the history fasinating.

It is true that the country is ruled with fear as history has seen the end fate of so many leaders' political career.end suddenly. I am not normally interested in political history, and the author has done such a great job in mixing history and the recent natural disaster. I really enjoyed this book.

"I found this story on the Recommended Bar of the Amazon page for the Michael Cole books I read. I wish I could give glowing praise for this book, but I can't. I've read a great deal of true-crime non-fiction as I earned my Criminal Justice degree. I've read just as many horror and police procedural fiction featuring serial killers / human monsters. This book tried too hard to be everything. A set location with several people, an escaped serial killer, picking up a hitchhiker outside of a prison (never the smartest move), and a bunch of different hockey masks.  A bubbling lake burping out rotten gaseous fumes killing fish and changing the color of the surrounding flora & fauna.<br /><br />There are a several large killer species that make appearances and a superman that defies all logic. Sadistic behavior. Vile acts by a depraved killer. Gruesome results from a sick individual. These books are escapism fiction for me, but this was even too farfetched for me.

Note that these are the original versions of the songs, complete with intros that were not recorded by Rod and transcriptions in different keys, so if all you're familiar with are the CD versions, then this will be a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />However, it was exactly what I was looking for; I would label this as low intermediate, with a short learning curve, and the songs are gentle, slow, romantic and jazzy, the kind of background music you'd expect in a romantic restaurant. There are no flashy pyrotechnics or harsh chords, only simple, slow melodies that evoke a simpler time. This is perfect for a beginning piano student, provided that you have a bit of patience.<br /><br />Bookwise, this is bare bones, with no photos and a scant 63 pages, but if you're a fan of the Great American Songbook, this is a very doable introduction to timeless songs that our parents / grandparents grew up with.",positive

"Incredibly slow and uninteresting story line. I love a good thriller, but this was mediocre at best. I found myself flipping through pages just to finish. I held out hope that the ending would make it worth it, but...nope. the characters were simply people no one would like or find interesting. And as a Chicagoan, we do not say ""attending University""...we say ""going to college"" or ""I go to THE university"". So, although this is nit picky, the incorrect local jargon was irritating.",negative

"""Auto Biography"" is a non-fiction biography about a 1957 Chevy Four-Door Wagon VIN# VB57B239191, the cast of characters that owned the Chevy, and those that work diligently to restore it. Earl Swift has an amazing knack of being able to intertwine each person's story with the history of the car and its 13 previous owners prior to it ending up in the hands of Tommy Arney, owner of Moyock Muscle.<br /><br />Tommy Arney is a foul-mouth and shady character himself but is definitely not all bad.  In fact, because the author keeps things real, the story has immense integrity.  Those who restore antique cars will understand the painstaking attention to detail concerning this car's restoration that is described within.  Although I do not restore antique cars, I love attending car shows and gawking at the gleaming paint jobs and pristine interiors their owners labored intensively to produce. Just as I think of my car almost like a person, those who restore old cars feel the same way.  This story should appeal to those readers and those who want to learn about the history of a car's previous owners.<br /><br />I would have liked to see before, during, and after restoration color photographs of the Chevy in the centerfold; however, no pictures were in this  pre-release copy nor does it appear that pictures will be included.  Other than the lack of photos, I found this a great read.  I loved the story which took the author nine years of research to produce.<br /><br />WARNING: This text is not PG-13 as there are a lot of ""F"" words and cussing in the book.",positive

"I have been reading Thich Nhat Hanh's books for 20 years and love them all!  Peace Is Every Step was the first book of Thay's (what TNH's students call him-means teacher in Vietnamese) that I read and it was a gift from my brother.  This is a wonderful, easy to read book and a good introduction into mindfulness practice.  It's the kind of book where you can open it to any page and read the teachings.  Each subject is usually just a few pages long so it's the kind of book you can keep in the bathroom to read a little bit a time :-).  Thay has such a wonderful way of explaining mindfulness in ""easy to understand"" terms in this book.  Practicing mindfulness meditation has changed my life.  Be warned:  Once you start reading one of Thay's books, you'll be hooked!!  :-)).  He is an amazing poet, writer and such a gentle, warm, funny, compassionate ""being"" that is so full of happiness and joy.  I highly recommend this book especially for people that are new the mindfulness practice.  I have given a number of ""Peace Is Every Step"" books to friends as gifts.  My book arrived in wonderful shape-<br />Enjoy the book-and remember to enjoy every moment :-))-",positive

"My family has been following a Keto diet for the last few months. One of the things we've missed is breads. This has a fun variety of Keto friendly bread foods. Some recipes are better than others, but the ones we've tried so far have been palatable. You won't mistake them for regular foods made with wheat flour, but it does satisfy our hunger for bread. The book is a little light on photos. I personally like to see a picture of the finished recipe in my cookbooks and most of the recipes in this book do not include pictures. And for the most part, the recipes require fairly normal ingredients. Since doing Keto, my pantry is full of some strange ingredients and I found that I had most everything needed for a lot of the recipes.",positive
"This is an excellent book for healthy eating that is organized perfectly. I had to make sure I read the introduction of the cookbook before I got started cooking.  In the introduction, I was instructed as to what type of ingredients to use in the recipes.  For instance unless otherwise specified, if a recipe calls for eggs they should be large eggs, if it calls for salt they it should be Kosher salt, etc.<br /><br />I made the lentil soup with tomatoes and spinach and it came out very flavorful.  The prep time took me longer than 8 minutes, however.<br />There are only 8 colored pictures in the center of the book so I had to visualize what the prepared dish would look like.<br /><br />In addition to all the easy recipes, there are also 6 chapters about Mediterranean cooking and the Mediterranean diet in general.  It's not really a diet but a way of life and a way of eating.<br /><br />The only think I could find wrong with the book is that in the introduction, it stated that vegetarian recipes will be noted by a tomato icon.  However, I looked both in the excellently done ""recipes at a glance"" index in the front and in the recipes themselves and there was no such icon anywhere.  I think this was left out of the book by accident.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book to help one start eating healthy and flavorful meals.",positive

"What a fun book! I kept putting reading it off, but once I sat down and picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I read the book from start to finish in about a day. The story is set in France. I found the descriptions of the scenery to be charming. The heroine of the story, Manderly is smart, well spoken, and interesting.  Xavier, the romantic interest, is almost too perfect. He's handsome, rich, and mysterious. There's a lot of French in the dialogue. Although I appreciate that the author wasn't trying to be accurate, I found that since I don't know any French, I would skip over those parts a lot. Then sometimes I would have to back track because I missed something. I was thoroughly entertained by this romance and I will definitely check out other books by this author.",positive
"I was expecting a haunted house story or perhaps a missing person story with elements of a true scary book. The Ghost Notebooks is more focused on relationship issues between the couple and an odd internal angst instead of being a horror novel.<br /><br />I just didn't like either Nick or Hannah much and I was far more interested in the house and it's history than either of them. Yet, page after page was dragged down with reminiscing about old family dinners, dissatisfaction with career choices, and what was wrong with their relationship. The pacing is slow and nothing much actually happens for the first third of the book. I finally just stopped halfway through simply because I lost all interest.",negative

"This was everything I love in a story. These characters took my heart on a ride. I loved the chemistry between these characters and the storyline was just so touching.

He is looking forward to his friends wedding in Maui with the hope that he will get time with his friend with benefits Stella Perry.<br /><br />Stella Perry lives a busy life full of starting up charities and raising money for them, since receiving a large trust fund from her father. Intelligent and sassy she is all about having a great time until she realizes she has fallen in love with her friend with benefits. So when she shows up at her friends’ wedding she tells Marcus that she no longer can continue their relationship with benefits. But what Stella didn’t count on was that Marcus was willing to start a real relationship with her.<br /><br />“Don’t be afraid to love, Marcus. I’ve realized that nothing is more important in this life than love. Not money. Not power. Without love the world is a very lonely place.”<br /><br />But Marcus is new to sharing anything with anyone. This is his first relationship and he is hiding something that potentially could effect both of their lives. Will these two get their HEA? Or will Stella get her heart broken by Marcus?

"Perfect, not a book that will languish somewhere in my home: a functional product that doubles up as a calendar and it will force me to look at the stitches.  I have borrowed plenty of books thinking I would look at the stitches and actually try some out: the books get returned to the library and I may have only looked at it once.  This is just the perfect kinda forum for me to learn a new stitch!  I am self taught knitter, so at first glance, some stitches look doable, but therer is a reference section for all the short hand if you need it (and.

Hours are provided, but it doesn't include admission prices, which frequently change. There are some suggestions regarding hotels and dining, but not very many. There are lots of color pictures and maps. In the back of the book, there is a pullout laminated map. The size of the book is good for traveling.",positive

They are full of colorful and interesting photographs. There are places in the book to answer mathematical questions. Each book has a glossary and answer key. I enjoyed reading each of these 10 titles and found them engaging as well as entertaining. They cover many different math topics such as perimeter, area, volume & mass, shapes, and much more without being stiff and dry. I do think they are priced a bit on the high end, but it is for a whole set of 10 books. Overall, this is a great set!",positive

"If you’re just going to hang this on the wall, there are probably better looking nautical charts that one could use. As far as actually reading it? The print is almost microscopic. Too small even with reading glasses on. Definitely not worth the price charged. Also, these are not all navigable rivers. If you look at this map, you would think that you can get to the Gulf from Lake Lanier north of Atlanta. That is not true. I wonder how many other rivers depicted on here are not navigable. One of the main reasons I got this was because it showed so many side trips from the great loop. But they are no good if I can’t actually rely on them to be usable. Yeah, as soon as you start researching you figure out that it’s not going to work, but I bought this map for basic preplanning and to get ideas.",negative

"having read all Heyer's and many other regency authors as escape entertainment,  i decided to try balogh. a competent writer, she unfrotunately feels the need to include bedroom scenes which to me are distasteful & unnecessary in this genre. too much romance not enough regency!  balogh does write well as far as pacing but this particular story felt hollow, lacking a real feel for the times and peopled with characters who were not quite human---if you like heyer, try sandra heath, joan smith, elisabeth kidd, carola dunn, et. al. for real regency flavor without the cheap bedroom stuff. balogh is a good enough writer not to need to do this.  this book's heroine is unattractive and not at all credible with constant description of bosom and decollete, etc...really annoying. for the prurient among readers i suppose this would suit, but for someone who is genuinely interested in the social mores, the town life, the class system, etc. of the era along with a light hearted romance - look to authors mentioned above who have a firm grasp on these background details that contribute color, immediacy, and vivid sense of place and time. joan smith's A Country Wooing was an excellent portrayal of the situation of many soldiers of napoleonic wars....estates left to be run by sisters or inept managers, trying to make the estates pay for themselves, marrying based on money so desperately needed to save the family home...another aspect to regency life along with the ton, the balls, the debutantes, etc...if reading this genre, i prefer regency romances to be steeped in correct regency detail/history and the romance to be clean. i dont understand this author's popularity - wont be reading another one by her.",negative

"I have been a fan of DK books for years. Their vibrant photos and illustrations have not only appealed to my children, but to myself as well. Both of my kids (now teenagers) would spend hours looking through their DK books. They had books on various animals, plants, historical events and time periods, Star Wars, and Lego ones. Within the last year, I became acquainted with the Smithsonian Series. They have the features that I loved about DK books and more. The more being that they are much thicker than the original DK books my kids grew up on.  They're both informative and interesting. The Explanatorium of Nature is filled with beautiful photographs and facts. It seems like it's the next step beyond the original series, geared toward older kids or even adults.

"Interesting book.  The author makes the case that 1971 was the year when rock 'n' roll turned into ""Rock.""  And it's a strong case, if not always a winning one.  Half the fun here is in agreeing / disagreeing with his point of view, especially in disagreeing -- it becomes like an internal, mental, one-sided debate.  The other sticking point is what's included and what's excluded.  Most of the inclusions are no-brainers, whether they are personal faves or not.  But sales numbers and chart placements shouldn't be the only determining factors.  One of my own long-time favorites, The Rascals, delivered two fine LPs in 1971, neither of which is even mentioned in this book.  Search & Nearness, the seminal rock 'n' soul band's final Atlantic Records release, was a fond farewell to five very successful years with Atlantic.  Peaceful World, the reconstituted group's amazing double-album Columbia debut, remains a heady blend of rock, pop, soul, jazz and R & B, and deserves a chapter all its own.  Someday, I still hold out hope, the world at large will catch up with -- and latch on to -- Peaceful World.  As for Never a Dull Moment, definitely recommended.",positive

"This is my first Shannyn Schroeder book and I really liked it. In fact, I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I don't usually like bad guy hero books, but this kept me interested from the get-go. Norah, the romantic lead in this book is a young, single woman who happens to be very pregnant. She comes back to her family home in Chicago so she can have the support of her family. She struggles with the choice of keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption. I thought her character was likeable and well written. Yes, she had made a mistake, but she was giving careful consideration to her options. And I really liked how the whole baby thing was handled. Her brothers were very over protective of her and I did get a bit tired of their alpha male brotherly attitudes and actions. Kai, the reformed bad guy was interesting and I did find myself rooting for him and Norah from early on. I loved Kai's mother and sister. I finished the book over a weekend and I've already ordered the next book in the series. Overall, it is a formulaic romance, but it was entertaining and engaging.",positive

"I'm a fan of biographies autobiographical tales from all walks of life. This one is presented in graphic novel format which is an interesting twist. I suspect there are some life lessons buried in this book, but I just didn't see the theme or cohesive thread tying any of it together.

"This is the most cheaply made textbook I have ever seen in my life. It is incredibly flimsy. The binding has no hope of holding up over time because the cover is just too thin for the number of pages. It has decent margins to take notes in, but the paper is so thin and glossy. The pages are difficult to read in certain lighting situations and at certain angles because of the glossiness. The book has a very strong bias— comments about a certain political figure should have definitely been excluded. Inserting political bias into a books that has nothing to do with the subject is unethical. I’m not even a supporter of the political figure in question, but I am strongly against using a psychology textbook as an outlet for the author’s personal political opinions. I also feel like the information could have been more concisely presented. I also fail to see how the price of this book is justified. Books a tenth of the price have better information in a better quality format. All of the images are in black and white. There is zero color printing inside this overpriced book.",negative
"I am a cat person and I enjoy reading, when I can find the time. I've read a short holiday story by this author, but I have not read her well known book, Homer. I found this to be easy to read. I work full time and don't have as much free time to sit down and read, but this was easy to read in chunks of time.  It was engaging and descriptive. A lot of her stories were reIatable to me and my own cats. This would be great for cat lovers!",positive
This had to be the messiest book I’ve read in a long time. I didn’t like the characters (I HATE whiny) and the only good thing was the premise. The story jumps all around and too many things are going on. Lexi has a split personality. One minute she’s a tough and confident business woman and the next she’s an indecisive and petulant child. This one didn’t deliver.  (I voluntarily reviewed an ARC).,negative
"Bill Clinton stopped the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans by magnificent leadership when George H Bush had done nothing about it. Clinton worked tiredlessly for peace in Ireland and the Middle East, yet she chooses Bill Clinton as a bad leader. Bill Clinton gets standing ovations when he goes to foreign countries, Bush Jr gets demonstrations showing the American flag with swasticas painted on it.  So who is the bad leader?  More right wing garbage. What else is new?",negative
"John Lennon at 37 is heading out to his island Dornish in Ireland. This novel Imagines what those 3 visits might have been like, especially the third. He buys the island in 1967 and visits briefly with Cynthia and later with Yoko but he spent 3 days there in 1978 with a friend doing scream therapy. The novel is made up of mostly dialogue between a John and his friend. They are amusing quips you might have imagined from John. Sweet but not complete.",negative

"I didn't want to put this book down! It grabbed my attention from the get-go. I finished it in a day. I would classify this as a chick lit book rather than a romance. The story starts when Dannie, is asked a simple question at a job interview - where does she want to be in 5 years. Shortly after that, something happens that causes her to doubt the path she's taking. Without giving anything away, she resists deviating away from her plans. I found it to be quite enjoyable!",positive
"This was a fun, engaging book. It's about an unlikely friendship between a middle aged woman and a young 18 year old woman.

It was my first book by this author and I would definitely consider reading something else by her.",positive

It took me at least three tries to get into the book, and then halfway through I just wanted it to be over.

I usually love to read books over and over, but I can't imagine plodding my way through this one again.  I wish I could have3 a refund.",negative
"I am a fan of the historical American Girl books. They do a great job of bringing history to young readers. This book introduces us to Melody, a young African American girl in 1964.  She lives in Detroit during the early Civil Rights movement. In one chapter, she and her brother face racial discrimination on a shopping outing. The book is written well and tells an inspiring fictitious story based on accurately true events and situations. There is additional historical information in the back of the book that includes photographs from that era. There are beautiful illustrations to go along with the text. This book brings history to life!",positive

"A paperback novelization of a film script that was abandoned.  Sad, really, for both Elvis Presley and his audience, because this version of ""Charro!"" (once known by the far better title ""Come Hell, Come Sundown"") would've made a much more interesting film than the one National General Pictures eventually made and released.  It's grittier, sexier, and more action-packed than the G-Rated, slightly better than your average late-'60s TV movie.  Had it actually been promoted as a television movie-of-the-week, the ""Charro!"" we know would likely have had a more positive reception (and stronger reputation); a premiere Elvis TV western back in 1969 would've been ratings gold.  But it was not to be, and this paperback version of the western that never was serves as a reminder of what might have been.",positive

"This a beautiful book for the preschooler in your life. I picked this particularly for when my 4 year old grandson was going to be visiting me this month for me to share with him. He loved the large colorful pages and was mesmerized by the story of Freeda the Cheetah. He asked me to read it 2/3 nights he was here last week and even asked me afterwards, when he was home, when I could read it to him again. Just a great children's book and I highly recommend it for having some one on one time with your children and grandchildren. I am saddened by the fact that many children today never share the joy of physical books any more, hopefully this book may make a difference in their lives. I am anxiously looking forward to the day when he can read the book to me!",positive

"This title was selected by my Book Club as one of our reads this year. Our theme was &#34;Georgia Authors/Subjects&#34;. Prior to reading this book, I was pretty indifferent about Paula Deen. I regularly make a couple of her recipes and I've been to her Savannah restaurant, but that's about the extent of it. I neither liked nor disliked her. After reading her biography, I can honestly say that I like her a whole lot more. Her life was not an easy one and she rose above all of her life's challenges and became very successful. It's written in her Southern Voice which was a little difficult for me because of the intentional misspellings and grammar issues, but it is effective. She is honest and shares all the good, the bad, and the ugly. It was an easy book to read and at the end of each chapter there's a recipe. There are a lot of photographs in the center of the book that I kept referring to as I read. Of course the book ends several years before all of the ugliness that surfaced in the media a few years ago. Maybe there will be an updated version later.",positive

"Hard book for me to get through. The main character was the most negative and insecure female! It made it hard to love and empathize with her. Her Mom was written as ridiculous and unbelievable as her. In addition, the same familiar and lazy tropes were heavily learned upon for character development. ie: 'she was beautiful but didn't know she was beautiful'  And 'his Dad, a millionaire, was self made and tough but still made his son come up in the ranks the hard way' ...sigh, try HARDER!!!<br />The writing paid no attention to all the rules of the English language. Using parenthesis, hashtags and run-ons like this book was a twitter post. It was very distracting. Like, it LITERALLY had me reading outloud, trying to figure out the cadence of speech and what the characters were trying to say. I included 2 examples in my review pictures. That coupled with massively unrelatable characters made this book lame.",negative

"As author T.J. English observes in the Introduction, WHERE THE BODIES WERE BURIED is ""an account of the trial of Whitey Bulger from a particular point of view.""  That point of view is, basically, outrage against the government law enforcement system that recruited a notorious Boston mob boss like Bulger as a ""Top Echelon"" informant, and protected him from prosecution for many years, despite his ongoing criminal activities (including murders, sex with underage girls, drug trafficking, and racketeering).<br /><br />English ""attended every minute and every day of the trial,"" and recounts the daily events in detail, in chronological order.  Thus he successfully captures the tedium of every long criminal trial.  The author's desire to see the full scandal of the FBI's unfortunate involvement with Bulger ""laid bare"" is admirable, but the scandal itself isn't all that interesting if you haven't heard of Bulger and his crimes before picking up this book.<br /><br />WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED represents a lot of research (through interviews with witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and former federal agents), and is reasonably well-written.  However, as one more reporter's eyewitness account of a famous criminal trial, it's boring.  Those who are already familiar with the Boston gangster's crimes will probably find it more interesting than I did.  I rate it at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",negative

"Two stars are for a well-researched look at the diver's life and what an actual dive for treasure would be like.  Two stars for credibility - as, at age 70, I would be surprised if Mrs Lowell had taken up deep sea diving for treasure.  Frankly, I was bored to pieces up to halfway through, and was close to not giving a damn about the story - particularly wading through the synthetically lovey-dovey dialogue and thoughts punctuated by blatantly sexy verging on vulgar exchanges. I tried to find some tender beauty in some of these words and thoughts between the lovers - and I'm no prude, but there wasn't much there.<br />Predictability was my other turn-off.  I could see the outline for this story posted on a white board while the Lowell/Maxwells wrote, and she followed it closely.<br />I realize I am out on the thin ice all by myself, as 24-30 million books sold probably means there are 24-30 million folks out there who think she writes a fantastic book.  Maybe the 60 others are fantastic.  I think this one falls short.",negative

"I read this book from cover to cover and most recipes seem very healthy to me but they include many ingredients and lots of spice and other aromatics.<br /><br />This is mostly a straight up recipe book with only an intro story and a descriptive paragraph preceding each recipe. There are many recipes that call for ingredients not normally in my cabinet such as preserved lemons, chermoula paste, harissa, etc. Nevertheless, I found several I could make with what I had on hand.<br /><br />I decided to make the Harira Soup because it looked delicious and wholesome.  There were 22 ingredients in this recipe but only 21 for me since I left out the cumin seeds as I dislike that spice immensely.  I attached a photo of most of the ingredients in this recipe. The soup came out absolutely delicious. It was very aromatic with a blend of wonderful flavors. I would definitely make this again and again and again (see last picture).<br /><br />This book also includes desserts, salads, etc. There is only one chapter dedicated to cooking in a tagine but unfortunately, most of those recipes call for a Dutch oven, slow cooker, etc. This is disappointing to me as a tagine is the cooking implement I think of for Morocco. Nevertheless, there are several recipes I might try one day in this book, no tagine necessary.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the selection I can choose from even though these recipes take time and are the furthest from bland. The fact that I also consider most of these dishes healthy is an added bonus.",positive
"Normally a book this length takes me a couple days to read. I struggled with this book, picking it up, getting bored, annoyed or disgusted and then putting it down and walking away repeatedly for over a full week.<br />I couldn't find one character in this tale that I cared even the slightest about. They're all fairly well messed up, self absorbed, neurotic or otherwise damaged. Even the kids are annoying especially the one who wrote an entire (overly long!) chapter in a Power Point slide show which mostly discussed her brother's obsession with and the cataloging of rests/pauses in songs. While these people felt real, I've met several neurotics who matched quite well the quirks of the people in this book I just couldn't care about them.<br />Worst of all and one of my major pet peeves the narrative jumps around not only in time (we often have NO idea where in time we are during the story) it also jumps narrative styles. We go from an objective narrator to first person and in one chapter the story is being told TO the reader as if they're one of the characters in the book. I found it disjointed, convoluted, frustrating and very annoying.",negative

"THE HISTORY OF KNITTING IN ART isn't really a ""history of knitting"".  The subtitle states more clearly what it is:  ""a collection of paintings, drawings, and prints from Western art in the 19th century"".  It's a booklet, not a book.  The collection consists of 34 full-color and 4 black-and-white reproductions of museum-quality artists' depictions of knitters plying their needles. For the price (about $10 on Amazon), this is a pleasant enough collection, nice to page through looking at the pictures (especially if you're interested in knitting history, as I am).<br /><br />There is no descriptive text for the included reproductions--all you get are the color and black-and-white plates.  For that reason, it isn't much of ""an ideal reference . . . for handspinners, knitters, and fiber artists"".  However, it would make a nice gift for a knitter.  The reproductions show only knitters, so if you're thinking of a gift for a spinner, I guess you would want the author's companion booklet, [[ASIN:1482618753 The History of Handspinning in Art]].  A much better (and more expensive) book with reproductions of knitters in art is [[ASIN:1858943418 In Praise of the Needlewoman: Embroiderers, Knitters, Lacemakers and Weavers in Art]]; an earlier book that does something similar is [[ASIN:0312134304 Anonymous Was a Woman]].<br /><br />Because it's inexpensive, but has a misleading title and isn't clearly described as a booklet, I rate THE HISTORY OF KNITTING IN ART at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive

"You're sure to find it in Jan Eaton's Famous Paintings in Cross Stitch. I first discovered this delightful book in the British cross stitch magazine Cross Stitch Gold, which featured a full color pattern based on Rossetti's ""La Ghirlandata,"" and spent the next two years trying to track down a copy of this excellent book. Note to self: why is it that all decent cross stitch magazines / books are English and super-expensive?!<br /><br />The book features fifteen projects based on paintings by Van Gogh (Irises), Klimpt, Mucha, Degas, Cezanna and Botticelli. Some of the projects, such as a Degas tote bag, are smaller and more manageable, while other large-scale projects such as Van Gogh's Irises and La Ghirlandata will keep you stitching for months, if not years.<br /><br />I wasn't as fond of the smaller projects; a Mucha-inspired curtain border paled next to the original print it was taken from, the Japanese woodblock print seemed a bit tired, and I noticed through careful comparison that the Degas tote bag insert featured an incomplete pattern (if you compare it to the photo, you'll see an area of shading under the ballerina that is coded in the legend, but not present on the chart). Generally, charts were easy on the eye and easy to read, although as previously mentioned, I found at least one instance where the chart and final project photo differed.<br /><br />Overall, if you feel like you've conquered easier projects and you're looking for something unique, try Famous Paintings In Cross Stitch for a Mona Lisa-inspired eyeglass case, delicate sachets, greeting cards and large-scale projects that your visitors will ooh and aah over.",positive

"This didn't capture my attention at first, but the more I read, the more I got into it. It got to the point where I couldn't put it down. The story is about Casey, who has the job of convincing authors to &#34;sell out&#34;.  It was entertaining and interesting. Casey is likeable, but flawed. She has a dysfunctional relationship with her mother. The relationship she has with her best friend is a little odd, but sweet. One of the subplots of the book involved some sexual misconduct which is very timely right now. I almost felt like it was written as a result of what's going on in the world right now, but it's merely a coincidence. Overall, I enjoyed this chick lit and look forward to reading other books by Franson in the future.",positive
"I have read many of Tim Weaver's books and enjoyed this one the best.  He has a created an interesting protagonist and his stories are always full of action and engrossing.  The plot of this one seemed less far-fetched than some of his previous books (which I thought was an improvement) and yet was still a good, believable story, engrossing and full of twists and turns.  Weaver adds some family drama to up the ante as in his other books.  If you enjoy action mysteries in general, you will enjoy this book for sure.",positive
"Like other readers, I thought that I was going to enjoy this book because I thought that it would be like John Fowles'The French Lieutenants Woman.  However, in all honesty, I feel that this author used the vehicle to ramble on and on in order to display what she feels are great literary abilities.  This novel contains a great deal of poetry.  I have nothing against poetry, but non of the poetry is lovely or memorable.  If the poetry is not wonderful then the reader begins to wonder why is he wasting so much time reading about poets that do not really speak to him or her.  The two poets in the novel speak to each other, but are of very little interest to the reader.  The author appears to me to be very pretentious.  While the story line is interesting, the way that it is presented makes for a very boring read.  The  novel rambles on for 544 pages.  I think there was enough here for only 144 pages.  This is no French Lieutenant's Woman.  The author seems to want to prove how capable she is to the reader, but in doing so she looses her reader.  There is no passion in her writing, even though she attempts to write a passionate romance.  She attempts to appear intelectual while trying to write about passion.  It doesn't work!",negative

"This was quite possibly the worst book I've ALMOST read in a long time. As a fan of MST3K, I really had high hopes for Nelson's book, and why not? The head writer and later host of a really funny show writes a book of reviews of cheesy movies - sounds really promising, doesn't it? Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver.<br />Nelson's book is written in a highly personal style - annoyingly so. We get to hear about his wife, his kids, his house, ad nauseum. The talent for repartee evidenced on his show is absent from his prose, and the jokes consist of abstract remarks that are neither humorous nor creative. The overall tone is that of a man who finds HIMSELF incredibly funny, and who cares what you think?<br />I managed to wade through about the first 30 pages of this stinker before I threw it down in disgust.

"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE Marian Keyes fan.  She is one of my favorite authors and I always return to her books to be entertained and enjoy familiar, fun characters.  That being said, I hated this book.  This is nothing like her previous books.  There is no lightness, there is no fun, and the ending was nothing but a let down.  This is absolutely not what I go to Marian Keyes books for and I will probably just throw the book away because I will never read it again.  I was horrified by most of it and it seemed like most of the content was written purely for shock value.  I'd say to please leave the graphic physical and sexual abuse scenes to others, Ms. Keyes, because I am now afraid to buy another book for fear of the content.",negative

"I really wanted to like this book. The message that a parent will love their child no matter how frustrated they get was so touching, yet completely derailed by the mother's later unhealthy, obsessive exhibits of her love. Sneaking across town and into your grown child's house is not a healthy way to show love. Metaphor or not the author could have shown the steadfastness of parental love throughout time in a much better way. I'd recommend Lisa McCourt's ""The Most Thankful Thing"" instead of this book.",negative
"I wanted to love this book. I love the genres of sci-fi, adventure and survival, so this book should have ticked all the boxes for me. Yet.... I kept thinking &#34;I've read this story before&#34; and getting distracted.<br /><br />Last night it finally clicked. This is very, very similar to Scott Sigler's Alive trilogy. Teenagers lost in space after a ship crashes, scary unknown bad guys and adults vanishing, one kid who tries to grow into the leader, mysterious alien technology, alien creatures and life forms on a hostile planet - both books share the same, basic major plot points. Seriously, read Alive and Awake by Sigler and then read this. Sigler did it first and he did it better.<br /><br />The story moves quickly, yet still bogs down with the incessant inner dialogue of Jonah and his self doubt. There is also a certain sense of chaos from the first few pages that is appropriate to the things going on, but that never really stops. I felt like the author kept introducing new kids, new tools and new directions without following through with adequate motivation for the characters. The bad guys are over the top, yet the only good guy seems to be Jonah - his feeling is that literally everyone around him is mean, intimidating, or something he's afraid to face. I wanted to root for him and hoped he would be eaten at the same time. I might have appreciated this book more had I not already read Sigler's series.",negative

"Close to Death is the third book in The Sensitives series by Rick Wood. Sadly I have to say after I really enjoyed the first two books, this one fell short for me. The plus the pace was good and there is anyways something going on. A new character, Martin, is introduced and I am curious to see if we will see more of him, personally I wouldn't mind.<br /><br />Now the plot concept was very interesting and unique, however I felt the execution was just not what it could have been. There were some decisions the author made, and yes it is his book, but to me they just didn't make sense. So we basically, without giving away spoilers, have four main characters, yet they are incapable of talking to each other. It is absolutely infuriating and yes I get it done of it is part to have the plot he developed, however I think the complete lack of communication is ludicrous. People who are friends and even lovers should talk more than these characters do. That to me just ruined it.<br /><br />Here is to hopi g that the next one will get it back to where this started so I can continue enjoying this series and don't have to call it quits.",negative
"I really liked the premise of this book. It was something fresh and different in my opinion. It started a bit slowly and it took me until about half way through before I started to really enjoy it. In the beginning and for the first several chapters, I didn't like most of the characters. But by the end, redemption was found for most of the characters and my feelings for them had changed. The book is filled with long, vivid descriptions. Unfortunately, I tend to gloss over paragraphs when there isn't much dialogue. I did have to go back a few times because I missed something. The ending was a little odd and left me slightly dissatisfied, but there was resolution and a sort of epilogue. In the end, I found it entertaining and I liked it.",positive

He remembers the jokes. That means he’s capable of remembering things like trash day. Thank you for keeping a book in his hands!",positive
"Some assembly required!  KRUSTEAZ CINNAMON CRUMB CAKE & MUFFIN MIX tastes good, but requires more preparation steps than you expect from a cake or muffin mix.  If you're making crumb cake, you have to layer the cake mix and crumb topping, swirl the batter with a knife, and then sprinkle on a final layer of crumb topping.  If you're making muffins, you have to fold half the crumb topping into the cake mix, and then sprinkle the remaining crumb topping on top.<br /><br />My husband loved these.  I loved the cake part, but felt that the cinnamon/sugar/crumb topping was too sweet.  However, you can't really go wrong with Krusteaz mixes, particularly [[ASIN:B0016BU7AK Krusteaz Banana Nut Muffin Mix)]] and [[ASIN:B0016BU7GO Krusteaz Cranberry Orange Supreme Muffin Mix]].<br /><br />For a crumb cake or 12 standard muffins, you need one egg, 2/3 cup water, and one package of the mix.

"Yes, my daughter loved the book. It has My Little Ponies in it. Not hard to make her like that. I think the book was extremely lacking. It is not a Beginning Reader at all. They replaced some words in the story with pictures. The words were too difficult for a Level 1 reader to read. This is just a cheap picture book with the word ""reader"" slapped on it so the extremely lacking plot would sell. A Level 1 Beginning Reader should contain simple words, repeating letter sequences, and repeating phrases. This book fails in all those areas. Yes, little girls will like it because it has My Little Ponies in it. But it really has zero educational value, which would be the entire point of a Beginning Reader.",negative

"DON’T BELIEVE IT is a complicated mystery/thriller with a lot of “chapters” printed entirely in italics--which gives you some idea of what you as the reader are in for.  The basic storyline is that a woman (Grace), who was convicted of murdering her lover on Gros Piton in St. Lucia, Eastern Caribbean, contacts an old friend (Sidney) and asks her to create a TV documentary about the case.  Grace hopes that Sidney will uncover new evidence that will exonerate her and cause her release from prison.<br /><br />Sidney obliges, and the italicized chapters are summaries of the resulting individual TV episodes as they air.  Thus the novel is multi-layered, with retellings of the basic murder events that are nestled inside new accounts of ongoing events (including the public’s reaction to the TV episodes).<br /><br />The plot is twisty, with some unpleasant things in store for the helpful Sydney.  There are many abrupt shifts among characters (e.g., Grace, Sydney, Gus, etc.) and locales (St. Lucia, New York City, rehab hospitals, etc.).<br /><br />In the end, the revelation of the killer’s identity and true motivation, and of why/how the novel’s various murders were/are covered up, is unbelievable.  (“Family first” and “blood is thicker than water” are strong motivations, but a good murder mystery needs more.)  The novel ends with a cliffhanger of sorts.<br /><br /> As a regular reader of mass market mysteries, I find a novel that is constructed like this one to be too much work to be enjoyable.  It's not particularly entertaining, and it’s slow going.",negative

"The author of MURDER.COM is a retired New York City lawyer.  The series title character (Reuben Frost) is a retired New York City lawyer.  Perhaps this explains what is wrong with this novel:  the author is a lawyer first, a storyteller second.<br /><br />The novel is literate, but the story doesn't flow because the language is stiff and formal.  At the beginning at least, the plot is simplistic.  Frost's detective friend Bautista tells him about his new murder case (a woman with a Ladbroke apartments address). Frost wishes Bautista luck, then goes to dinner at the Four Seasons with a former client (Courtland).  Courtland chooses the excellently presented Steak Tartare;  Frost goes for Maryland Crab Cakes.  Courtland then asks Frost to look into the very, very recent disappearance of his adult daughter (an editor who just moved into the Ladbroke apartments).  The two women's names are different, but  guess what?  The murder victim is the client's daughter!  So Frost and Bautista team up to solve the murder.  Except for the descriptions of characters' backgrounds and expensive NYC restaurant dinners, this is basically all that happens in the first 40 pages.<br /><br />The novel literally put me to sleep every time I picked it up.  I even started it over again from the beginning, to be fair, but I just couldn't get into it, and finally I gave up.  Because I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting, and the plot too thin and obvious to keep me reading, I rate MURDER.COM at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative

"I really enjoyed [[ASIN:B00LYXED0A The Honest Folk of Guadaloupe]] by this author, in which the story was told from multiple viewpoints, with flashbacks, and had to be pieced together by the reader. The description of Guadaloupe itself and its political/judicial system was beautifully done, and was part of the novel's appeal.<br /><br />The plot of THE SECOND DAY OF THE RENAISSANCE (INSPECTOR TROTTI) unfolds in a similar disjointed, obscure fashion, but it was too much for me this time.  I’m never fond of flashbacks, and the ones here were maddening.  When Trotti answers a summons from an old police friend, who warns Trotti that a contract killer is after him, the flashbacks come one after another, just piling up, as the friend is constantly interrupted and then doles out miniscule bits of information after each interruption.  Trotti keeps asking the friend to come to the point, but the friend insists on passing along his information in his own way, taking his own sweet time.  Like Trotti, the reader wishes that the friend would just get on with it.<br /><br />Even after I was well into the novel, I had no idea what Trotti had done to warrant being targeted by a hit man, or what all the various people and scenes described in Trotti’s flashbacks had to do with each other or the plot.  Trotti himself is an unattractive, depressing character.  The descriptions of Italy lacked the charm of the ones in &#34;Honest Folk&#34;, and weren't enough to salvage this novel.",negative

I actually had to set a timer to break away from it at one point because I had to be somewhere and I didn't want to stop reading. The main characters were likeable, but a bit dull. The stalker/killer narrates the end of every couple of chapters.

Each page is full color and glossy with lots of pictures throughout each book. I think these are a decent resource, but the set seems a bit more random than I would necessarily like.

"When I saw the comparison of this book to A WRINKLE IN TIME, I was very intrigued. I read WRINKLE in seventh grade and loved it. And I'm sorry, there is no comparison.<br /><br />Yes, I am a lot older than seventh grade now, and you may think that has colored my review of this book. But I remember what I was reading at age ""10 and up,"" which is what is the age range for this book is: Albert Payson Terhune and JOHNNY TREMAIN and THE GREEN POODLES and THE GOOD MASTER and its sequel, and NATIONAL VELVET. And compared to any of those, especially A WRINKLE IN TIME, this book is terribly shallow. There is a stereotypical unusual kid, who despite being a child genius is having a conflict with an older sibling, she's got nice parents who overprotect her because she's bullied because of her genius--everything by the numbers. You don't get any deeper into the characters than that--they're all very superficial. By the end of A WRINKLE IN TIME I feel I know each of the Murry family members (even Sandy and Dennys, who only have a small role); in this book the characters are like paper. Plus Lily is being a brat and her parents just shrug it off as her ""just being a teenager"" and having hormones. Since when does that excuse her from being a brat?<br /><br />The scientific principles are presented in a very understandable manner for ""10 and up,"" and Maisie's unique solution to the problem is neat, but it doesn't make up for the 2D characters accompanying them.",negative
"I usually pay attention to the reviewers that state this book was purchased on Amazon, but for whatever reason I completely missed the mark here.<br /><br />To start, let me honestly admit I skipped parts of this book. And this is likely why I don't understand some of what happened, but in my favor it was only towards the end that I started skipping entire paragraphs at a time.<br /><br />The romance part of this story is almost non existent. I have no idea why these two characters fell in love. Much of the story was devoted to anything but their relationship, I didn't care about them anyways.<br /><br />The authors writing was not enjoyable. It felt like work trying to get through this book. The scenes were weird, the transitions were terrible. I swear I remember one part where the heroine was saving the hero from his jail cell and I could have sworn I remember reading that she was painting her toe nails... forgive me, but WTF?<br /><br />The dialogue people claim is witty seemed stilted to me.<br /><br />The ""amazingly different best ending of any romance novel ever"" reviewer was so completely off the mark, in fact the ONLY reason I read through to the end was in the hopes that this one reviewer was right. Nope, no way! She was most definitely wrong.",negative
"This is a very informative book. Worthwhile because the subject is a world leader and I'd say a good one.

That said, I appreciate the peak into her life that this book affords.",positive
"I found this book really hard to read: it's written in an incoherent, breezy style, with insufficient organization to make its arguments and conclusions clear.  You have to kind of fight with the author to wring sense out of every single page, and after a couple of chapters I get rather tired of this sort of thing.  It cites research findings sloppily and incompletely, again with that breezy style.  It has hucksterish language about how the author is going to help you understand the secrets of success, and manages to contradict itself often, with complete unconcern.<br /><br />That said, there are nuggets of useful information here.  Perhaps a patient and sane editor could have condensed the book into 50 pages of sense, but that doesn't make the publishers money, does it?  So that kind of editor got shunted to academic books early in their career, so this is what we get.",negative
"What a sweet and fluffy read! I enjoyed this Latin themed romance. The lead characters are likeable and have a great chemistry. There's a sizzle when they first meet, but they both resist their attractions for most of the story. There's a lot of simple Spanish phrases thrown in the dialogue that was easy to figure out. The plot was a familiar one in the romance world, but the Puerto Rican culture was a nice variation. This was a very fast and easy read. I would definitely consider reading the next one in the series.",positive
"I love reading the thrillers gendre and I watch too many crime shows on TV, so hence I thought this plot was a little drawn out and predictable.  Dont get me wrong, there were moments where I was caught in the description, but the plot left me with 'ooh, it is a who's done it' and the outcome once revealed, the rest was tedious and the ending was weak.<br /><br />I just think in part 3 of the book - it was in crazy land and no normal person would stay unless they are equally mentally ill and it just didnt seem to fit the character than was in part 1 and 2 of the novel.  Sometimes, you can try to be too clever and it is hard to unravel and connect the dots to make sense of it all.",negative
"What a handy resource to have! First of all, the size is small, but it's a well made small book. The pages are heavy weight & the cover is laminated. The font size is small, too, but it did not effect my ability to read it. I do have to wear readers to read anything these days as it stands! There are lots of photo images which I love! The page layouts are very attractive. You do have to open the book very wide in order to fully read everything. I am afraid that over continued use, this could effect the spine and the gluing. I did take a picture of the inside of the book so it can be seen. The information in the book is wonderful! There's an index which is very useful, too. There is also a Table of Contents so you can easily find the Essential Oil that you are looking for directly. The sections are color coded. If you are looking for information on using Essential Oils to help with breathing, then you go to the section called Easy Breathers. Then within that section, each 2 page layout is about a different Essential Oil and how to use it to help with breathing. Within each section, they are not in alphabetical order, which if they were, it might be more helpful. For each oil, there is safety information, recipes for blends using that oil, basic information on the plant it is derived from, and how to use it for spirit, mind, & body uses. I consider myself a beginner with Essential Oils and I find this guide book to be very thorough and helpful!",positive
"I didn't have high expectations for this book. The first chapter started off well, but then I lost interest in the second chapter. I kept reading it, slowly over the course of a few days and I am so glad I did! Things picked up and I absolutely loved it! After the slow start, I couldn't put it down. It's about a young reference librarian who loves to read spy novels. A mysterious British man comes to her library and asks for her help with some research. The chemistry is strong. I really liked both of the main characters. They were interesting and likeable, but not perfect. There's a lot of technical library jargon. The spy plot line reminded me somewhat of Mission Impossible. The sexual content is pretty mild and not graphic at all. I was very excited to see that there is a sequel in the works!  **Update: I just preordered the sequel - I liked it that much!",positive

"A YEAR IN THE GARDEN:  365 INSPIRATIONAL GARDENS AND GARDENING TIPS is a gardener’s perpetual daily calendar (months and dates only, no days of the weeks or years) with beautiful full-color garden photos.  It’s very heavy (4 lbs. 8.8 oz.) for such a small hardcover book (8” x 8”), and somewhat clumsy to handle.<br /><br />Gardening enthusiasts will enjoy reading the “tips”, which are actually short, opinionated essays about garden topics rather than serious how-to advice.  For example, the June 1 entry says, in part:  “Rose archways not only provide support for the plants but are also eye-catching and can be used to partition space, if they’re the appropriate size, material and style for the garden. ...Choose as wide an arch as possible.  Roses bloom more abundantly when their tendrils are not vertical but are guided horizontally in gentle spirals. …”<br /><br />The accompanying photo for June 1 shows a lovely archway of light and dark pink roses that frames a rustic woven willow bench.

"Man I hate to thrash somebody's book, but after dusting this thing off today to see whether I could get anything new out of it, I feel duty bound to save others from the frustration I experienced.<br /><br />I got a bachelor's degree for guitar performance, and I have played in rock, blues, country, dance, variety, etc band since I was a kid. I have always felt like I have the right kind of mind for improvisation - I improvise well in those other genres - but I never got bit hard to make a serious study of jazz about 2 years ago. This book was the only book I bought to supplement transcription as my tutor.<br /><br />So - yeah, first mistake right there. If you want to avoid my bad experience, be smart and buy a bookshelf's worth of books.<br /><br />Now that I am off the ground as a jazz improviser (tho I wouldn't say good by any broad set of criteria - give me a decade to work on good), I can say that this book seems mislabeled.<br /><br />I think the ideas in the book are novel and informative, especially for a composer who wanted to analyze jazz solos and make sense out of them - maybe develop a vocabulary of motives and develop them in a familiar classical composition process - but I don't see this a great tool for the woodshed in its current form.<br /><br />For a new edition, I would like to see less - none, in fact - of the totally abstract permutation stuff like intervals on p19, and much more of the cookbook type stuff starting on p139.<br /><br />I now understand where this book was coming from, but I simply didn't benefit much from it.",negative
"When I first received this book to review, I saw that the author had written a previous account of her early childhood in foster care, ""Somebody's Someone.""  I ordered this book from the library, thinking it would give me insight into the current book, and it does.  If you have time, I urge you to read ""Somebody's Someone"" first, as it will give you background and context.  Frankly, it is better written as well.<br /><br />However, I do not want to take anything away from ""Someone Has Led This Child to Believe.""  Regina continues the account of her life through adolescence and early adulthood, and it is difficult for this middle class white woman to comprehend how she survived with her spirit and mind intact.  I am sure writing these books has been cathartic for her, and I applaud all those who tried to help, and especially those who succeeded.  Most readers will be appalled at the abuse, physical, mental, sexual, psychological, that Regina lived through.  Essentially abandoned by her mother and father, sent from foster home to group home to the homes of parents she did not know. Expected to clean the house and care for younger children when only a child herself--how she survived this is nothing short of a miracle.  And the miracle comes in the form of people who saw something of value in Regina and led her to believe in herself and her future.<br /><br />This book will appeal to those who are interested in children, such as foster parents and teachers, but it is not an easy read.  It is a good and necessary book, however.  Highly recommended.",positive

"I thoroughly enjoyed this fifth entry in the Henry Worth series and plan to pick it up with book 1.  Hank is the elected county sheriff in Branson County, Missouri.  We quickly learn that three new recruits have been trained and are starting work in the wake of several employee terminations.  The department is deeply divided over a budgetary decision to allow no overtime, in order to maintain a full staff.  Hank's wife, Maggie is the ER doctor in town.  She has noticed that an unusually large number of older bus tourists have ended up in the hospital with dehydration and low blood sugar issues while attending some of the entertainment venues. Hank agrees to take a look at the issue.  Booth does a nice job weaving in department politics, the advancement and performance of various less experienced people and the new recruits, the Chief Deputy Sheriff's efforts to quietly keep a handle on how bad the remaining angry employees are making things for the newbies or less experienced folks, and in general, a character named Earl who is a civilian clerk with more common sense in his pinkie than most of the folks around him.  There is a murder, the victim not quite likable so we have a number of good suspects.  There is a bigwig that Hank has never cared for who he is sure is involved somehow.  There are the County Commissioners, with one anti-sheriff bozo and others not willing to adequately fund the department.  All in all it's a great cast of characters with some very original plot twists and some lessons on effective community policing and doing the right thing.  I was sleepy when I started the book.  Booth starts many sections of the book without identifying the character who we are reading about.  I had to go back and pick up her style but it was a very enjoyable technique once I read the whole book wide awake.",positive

"I love food-themed mysteries and have read several series; this was the first I'd heard of Aunty Lee. Set in Singapore, Aunty Lee runs a popular restaurant that serves Peranakan food, a blend of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian dishes. As I was not previously familiar with Singaporean culture or cuisine, the author did a good job at providing enough detail that it was easy to follow along. The descriptions of food were mouthwatering, although I would have liked to see one or two recipes included in the back of the book.<br /><br />As a narrator, Aunty Lee is certainly likeable enough, a harmless-seeming elder who brought to mind a Singaporean Jessica Fletcher. Aunty Lee infiltrates a prayer group and does her own digging into a series of events leading to the deaths of a prominent lawyer and her son; their deaths are blamed on her buah keluak, a chicken dish served with nuts that if not prepared properly, can prove fatal.<br /><br />My main issue with ""Aunty Lee's Deadly Specials"" was that I had figured out the main plot twist very early into the novel, and was frustrated with how long it seemed to take Aunty Lee to catch on. However, as I enjoyed the cultural elements and descriptions of Peranakan food, I will be sure to pick up the first book in the series for comparison.<br /><br />Verdict: this is a fun beach read, but not one of the best food-themed mystery series I've read (I still stand by ""Bruno: Chief of Police"" for its wonderful descriptions of food in France's Perigord region!).",positive
"I was a little disappointed with this book after I saw the Oprah book club praised it as one of the top twenty books I'll read this year.  which it might because I probably read about twenty five a year, but if it gets in the top twenty, it may be more on sample size rather than its own merits.  It definitely was not a bad book, but I don't feel that it was a great book.<br /><br />The development of the character was slow, slow enough that I put this book down for over a month before returning to it.  The main characters childhood was developed in broad anectdotes that did slowly come together, but it did read slowly at the beginning.  The book definitely sped up after he snuck out of the orphanage and started living on the streets of Point Noire.  In fact I was starting to get into his progress when inexplicably suddenly, he was struck by brain lesions and the book careened in a new direction.  Perhaps true to life, but as I was waiting for the character to live up to his fated name of Black Moses, his whole life is thrown into confusion and weirdness.  Perhaps this section provided the best humor and tension as I hoped for a cure though.<br /><br />In the end I came away thinking it was good to read, although I have a history of studying the region so I appreciated a lot of the book that someone new to west central Africa would not.  I'm glad I read it, but I don't know how long it will stick with me.  I will say this, hoping not to be a spoiler, The very end twist struck me as very strong.  Up until the last page I think I was sitting on a three star rating.",positive
"I saw the ABC documentary, but it no way prepared me for the content of this book.  Within the first few chapters, the things that philip did to her, as a11 year old was so disturbing that i couldn't believe for one moment was happening.  Yet, it happened.  And this is just one account of so many out  there that remains untold.  I am so grateful for Jayc to reveal as much as she did on her life and how she made it through those 18 years it is an amazing story of survival and love.  I read this within one day and it makes you think of how many people who are out there that need help: especially the perpetrator, it unfortunatel starts with them.",positive

"I have to admit I was rather surprised at what this book ended up being.  It is a very deep existential look into dogs and where they fit into our culture.  Along the way there are a lot of interesting facts such as Trump is the only president ever to not be a dog owner, which may make him uniquely the way he is. Also, you learn how monotheism was the downfall of our esteem for dogs as godlike creatures which are now loathsomely low on the single god totem pole.  They went from revered to downtrodden.  It's a dense, almost academic book, which if you like that kind of thing, is filled with little delicious tidbits.  But if you are not into that thing I would think it would be heavy, hard reading, especially for the less academic dog lover.  It was an interesting read for sure, but I don't think it's for the mainstream masses.",positive

"Wow.  Seventh Amos Decker!  I liked this one a lot, as Amos is paired with a new partner from Baltimore, an African American woman named Fredericka ""Freddie"" White.  The FBI folks he trusts and knows are gone and Amos is shaken that Alex has left for a post in New York and he is blindsided with a new partner.  They are immediately sent to Florida to address a murder of a Federal judge.  With lots of suspects, more than one death, an extremely successful corporation with some kind of involvement, a local agent who might or might not be too involved with local big wigs, trips to Miami and Key West and one golf community after another, the two have a lot on their plates and a lot of getting used to each other to do.  Freddie has a sympathetic backstory and a very supportive mother.  She quickly shows she's got great agent chops, but will Decker let her in?<br /><br />The audible version was entertaining.  I thought the narrator doing the women's voices was exceptional and the male narrator was very good, so satisfying and not jarring.  I've never noticed how often Baldacci has his characters, when talking about the case, repeat a bunch of the facts they've established or their theories.  I find that kind of annoying.  I definitely liked all the characters, the setting and thought the red herrings were pretty well done.  One solution was down to two possible people for me and that other was a wild card for me but still a decent resolution that I should have suspected and didn't.  Good book!",positive

"Took me awhile to get through this. I’ve been working for a Fortune 500 for the last 20 years, involved with a few M&A efforts, none of which involved startups but rather larger well asablished businesses. I struggle with how Stengel is able to get cretable advice/opinion from these corporate giants.<br /><br />I think business social politics unintentionally handicaps great companies. As Stengel quotes in his book, David Kidder GE. “You have to lower the cost of failure and create a permission in the conversation where the default state is forgiveness”  Over The years I’ve seen plenty of Situations where VPs or lied to or not told the whole truth because directors and managers are afraid to admit failure, instead spinning a turd of a outcome into something that resembles minimal success. I’m not saying I have the right answers or that I would even doing things differently if I were in their position. It’s almost like if having or finding success in failures is important, than there should be some way of rewarding it. Sounds strange and I have no idea how you would make that work but if you’re a CEO and your saying<br />We need to me ok with failure than you’d better have a way to celebrate at.",positive

"I love graphic novels for often being a little on the bizarre side and this collection does that in spades.  Tonta is a great and believable character with depth and she is surrounded by an interesting cast of characters from an extended blended family to the homely tutoring classmate who has become a forest spirit.  Characters come and go as a family murder mystery unravels, complete with an injustice in the end.  It is a great interwoven tale.<br /><br />The illustrations are black and white and masterful.  The handling of human forms and faces is good and it keeps you turning the pages.  This is definitely an adult comic book, so keep it from young children, but if you like a quirky tale and you are fine with some nudity and implied violence, I recommend this graphic novel.",positive

"This is a good, yet basic primer for the Office 2019 suite of tools that include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. In fact,  a some of the instruction is usable across other Office Versions such as 2016.<br /><br />Part 1, which is the first two chapters, goes over just basic information on copying and pasting, modifying pictures, drawing, etc. This was actually the part I was disappointed with the most because the text leaves out which software package is being used for the examples provided. I just used the text as a guide (not necessarily verbatim) and created an outline of the image that is on Page 58 of the book (see photo). However, I should have used PowerPoint and not Word to do it. It was unclear to me until I looked at Figure 3-15 that the author was using PowerPoint.<br /><br />Other than this, the other sections are dedicated to each tool and the instructions are step-by-step. Unless one wants to go through all the basic functionality of each package, this book is best used as a reference with the help of the Table of Contents and the Index.",positive

"The author, who was a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Education and Business, suffered a stroke on Labor Day weekend in 2010. This is her narrative of the challenges she faced and still faces and how she had to re-frame her identity. Within the context of her story, she weaves the narratives of other stroke survivors from the age of 13 all the way up to 64 years.<br /><br />What is very clear is that there is hope but there is also extreme disappointment when stroke survivors are not able to be the person they once were. Depending on the situation, the physical, speech, cognitive, medical, sexual, and support challenges differ as survivors navigate their life with a new identity.<br /><br />It was clear that most of the people interviewed for this book have family and other support. There was not one person who was profiled that did not have at least some support at the beginning. In this case, this book is a view of ""those who have."" A stroke survivor who has absolutely no family or friend support and no money or insurance would most likely not even have the good to moderate recovery some the of the survivors profiled have.<br /><br />In the end, the author lists the biographies of the survivors. Only one survivor was totally paralazed and mute and could only move her eyes. The rest did recover somewhat. What I love is that the author is forthright in saying she had help in writing this book due to her stroke. It makes one realize that accomplishments are possible if there is a support network available. Unfortunately for those who don't have that, the road to recovery, although possible, is bleak. I wish the author would have profiled those type people as well.",positive

"In most of my life, I have owned cats. I currently have 3 senior girls. This book is an easy read. I sat down and was able to read it from start to finish in a couple of hours.  I found it to be informative. There was some new information, but most of it was stuff that I already knew, so it would probably be very helpful to new cat owners. There are  colored pictures (of cats, of course!) at the start of each chapter. Each chapter also has a personal story or author's insight section, too. I do wish there were more pictures and not just because I love cats!  For example, there's a section about cat body language. It would have been helpful to see exactly what the position looks like. Another comment that I have is that the book refers to cat therapy music a couple of times. I would like more information about that as I don't know what cat therapy music is. Overall, I enjoyed the book and learning a little more about my fur babies!",positive

"It was a long, bizarre, cruelty laden, obscenity filled, gory horror story. A lot of information to absorb. A lot of suspension of disbelief. But the worst was reading for 400 pages and not really knowing if I understood what was going on.

"There are three main things I learned from this book. 1.) I apparently I do not know nearly as much about art and the artistic process as I thought I did. This author does an excellent job of explaining minute details about art, the industry and just about every aspect of the art world. 2.) What I do know is books and how they are written and whether they make the cut. 3.) Referring to the aforementioned statement on books, this one failed miserably.<br /><br />This book is as good as the title. I do not mean this in a positive light. If you have read the title, then you have essentially read the book. There is no real mystery, a total lack of intrigue and the writing is just bad. I wanted to love this book. I think with an editor who knew what they were doing and took their job seriously, this author would have been saved from the angry ruminations of hundreds of readers like me. This book made me think though, I will give it that. This book made me think about how we judge traditionally published authors VS. Those who have chosen to publish independently. Perhaps the divide is not so great as I once thought.",negative

"Just because you like mysteries with some fun and humor mixed in, that may not be enough to carry you through 459 pages.  It wasn’t enough for me!  There was too much fantasy, too much things didn’t always appear to be what they were, too many twists, and not enough meat.  Perhaps I give myself away when I tell you that I did not stand in line for Harry Potter books or movies, either.<br /><br />I fear that I have become a serious reader, needing characters based upon people I know, locations I have heard of or visited and a mystery that Agatha Christie might write.  I tried.  I tried and put this down too many times - and finally decided that I could still provide a service for those who pick this up expecting one thing and finding another as I did.<br /><br />I did enjoy the writing style, the descriptions, the detail - and I appreciate the unbelievable imagination the author had in creating this tome.  I just couldn’t get into the story.",negative

"[[VIDEOID:cb170ff4ff7eb97818ce846c9b275c96]] This is a baby board book, not a board book as listed. Read all the reviews before you buy this for your school aged child. Apparently it only comes in a small board book format, even though it’s listed as a hardcover. The photos I took compares it with a regular sized hardcover. It’s misleading. I bought 2 of these before realizing that. Then I read the reviews and did some research....oops. Though this is great for babies and toddlers to chew on, a school age child might not feel like a big kid if they receive it. As a school teacher, I know it’s too “little kid” for my students.",negative
"In large part this is a warm and charming story of how wrongs can be made right. A girl from an abusive home makes a new friend and her life changes for the better. But I'm not sure I'd want a child to read about the abuse in the book, as I think it could be scary given the descriptions of physical and emotional abuse. I think that tweens would be fine with the intensity. As an adult, I enjoy young adult and children's fiction, and I enjoyed this one too. But I think it suffered a bit in that it everything worked out so simply and predictably -- it did not seem to acknowledge the lifelong struggles that a child who had suffered such abuse would face. It is also a bit formulaic: child from broken family with a special ability conquers her past and does wonderful things (compare Harry Potter). I very much appreciated the clarity of the writing and found it to be a fast and pleasant read.<br /><br />Wish I could give it 4.5 stars.",positive

"The Quiet Beatle??  I don't think so, or, as the old saying goes, still waters run deep.  There was a lot going on beneath that calm exterior, including an often wicked sense of humor, deep thoughts on family, faith and societal  concerns, and sometimes a kind of righteous anger.  His spiritual journey both underpins and dominates his adult life, without apology, and his admirable desire to simply be a working musician, rather than an ego-driven Rock Star, make up a large part of his continued appeal.  Well-edited and a wonderfully interesting read.  Highly recommended to Harrison / Beatles / '60s & '70s rock fans.",positive

"I went back and read TKAM before reading this.  I wish I'd stopped at the end of &#34;Mockingbird.&#34;  This new offering -- well, to be blunt, it just isn't that good of a read.  I could sympathize with Scout's (Jean Louise) conflicted feelings as she revisited her home, and discovered new sides to the people she loved.  These were the most interesting parts of the book.  But the conversations with Uncle Jack got really tedious -- if I met the man in person, he would be annoying at least, and might even seem to be mentally unhinged.  His endless literary and historical references added little to the story at hand.  Calpurnia?  We see her for about two pages -- disappointing.  And Atticus?  I just don't know how to feel about him -- and a better book would have more clearly explained his feelings and motivations.  I kept hoping this book would wrap things up nicely.  Not necessary redeem Atticus.  It wasn't mandatory to make him back into the hero we've all loved for fifty years.  But do &#34;something&#34; with him -- I was at least hoping to understand what made him &#34;tick&#34; by the end of this book.  He didn't have to turn out to be an angel, but it would have been nice to at least understand him, and to have his daughter understand him.  I didn't get that.  He seems to be a blank slate -- almost as annoying as Uncle Jack's endless ramblings.  If you're a &#34;Mockingbird&#34; fan, you might want to avoid this one.  I wish I had.",negative

Once you get past the first half of the book and the pace picks up, then it is a bunch of friends turning on one another while caught in a web of lies only to find out it was the parents all along that had been keeping secrets and telling lies.  Then, at the end there was a nice little BBQ to help everyone make up and be friends.  I found it to be a frustrating and disturbing book.  I also have to admit that I am a conservative mom and maybe some parents are okay with the adult topics being thrown at their kids like molestation and sex among young teens, but this just didn't work for me.  I definitely wouldn't want my young teenager to read this book.  There are so many better books out there.  Skip this one!",negative

Sure, I to knowDS Daniels and her crazy work ethics and temper!  Haha.  Not an action novel, but it sure gets your heart pumpinign in the last 20% of the novel when the big reveal happens.  I kinda miss this style of writing as it is much more realistic than the action man approach, which I also love.  Great novel.

"My father is 80 and recently my sister and I were talking about how we wanted to get him to write down some things that he remembered so we could preserve those memories. This book is just what we needed! The book is filled with questions and prompts. This didn't arrive until after my last visit with Dad, so I'm holding on to it until the holidays. The book leaves about half a page (with lines) for writing space. I'm thinking about having him do some of the writing, but as he has gotten older, writing is more labor intensive for him than it used to be. So my sister and I will probably do a lot of the writing. We do realize how important it will be for us to have things written in his own hand writing. I am very impressed with all the great questions that are included! I hope we're able to get all of them answered.",positive

"I am a big fan of DK books, but this is my first Smithsonian one. I love the format of DK books. They have lots of photos and short sections. They're good for those with short attention spans. I am not good at reading non-fiction books, but the DK ones are broken up into small chunks which make it easier to read. My first reaction when I opened this one was that it brought back memories of a Time Life coffee table book of the 1960's that my parents had when I was a child. I was born in the late 60's, so a lot of my knowledge on this war is owed to movies and may not be entirely accurate. This book covers a lot of information, starting in the 1950's and going into the 1970's. I personally don't believe that this one book can cover everything that happened, but it's a great start. It's a thorough overview of the war and the events leading up to it. The photographs bring the subject to life. The book is informative and engaging.",positive

"Having thoroughly enjoyed Greg Herren's BOURBON STREET BLUES and JACKSON SQUARE JAZZ I was really looking forward to this one. It was a colossal disappointment to say the least. Whereas the other two were light and witty and the hero was charming, this book was dark and depressing and the hero was an egoistic, jealous, and above all--STUPID bore. It was obvious from the word go who had abducted his boyfriend. So for nine tenths of the book, in spite of the school of red herrings that were constantly thrown at us, we were left to agonize at his ineptitude. And then there's the ending! Believe me it was all for nothing. Stick with the two books I've mentioned. Forget this irritating trip to nowhere.",negative
"A couple of our kids read this book and enjoyed reading it and have good feelings about the book but surprisingly few strong memories of the book.  We actually pulled the book out and as we read the description there was a lot of ""Oh yeah's"" that brought back some memories but the book definitely did not burn strong memories in their minds.<br /><br />But any reading is good reading and they still say they recommend the book although they don't remember much.  Will keep it at four stars.",positive
"Carolina Moonset is both a fun book to read and a meaningful book about family, aging and illness, Beaufort, Carolina roots, mystery and murder.  Joey Green goes to Beaufort to spend time with his parents who moved to his paternal grandparent's house after years in Chicago.  His father Marshall, who ran a medical clinic in Chicago for indigent people, has Lewey Body Dementia and dealing with its impact on his short term memory and behavior is exhausting to his caretaker wife.  Joey and his sisters are taking turns giving his mother breaks.  Along the way, his fathers strong memory of his youth brings forth stories and implications about people from the community, including the Hammond family.  Now, Tom Hammond has been murdered and Marshall is implicated.  Joey teams up with Leela, daughter of his parents' neighbors, first as a casual date and later as an increasingly intense relationship with potential. The characters, both living and dead are interesting, the plot just twisted enough, with some good red herrings and we care about those involved and want things to be okay for them.",positive
"I love reading about Agnes and Eleanor..they are senior citizens who are always on the move and that means,they are usually at the right place...at the wrong time ! lol. and there's usually a body or two involved. this set of 3 books is the beginning of the series and not only are there bodies ..there are ghosts..some are friendly,some are sweet, some are snarky, and some are just down right scary !  ..and Agnes and El..meet them all. There is even a young girl ghost who attaches herself to Agnes...after Ag gets into a bad car accident and hits her hear,.she wakes up in the hospital with this ghost looking at her..seems Aggie's accident happened at the exact place that the ghost &#34;CAROLINE&#34; died in her hit and run accident..this is where the ghosts become visible to Agnes and she is surprised to have this new talent.. but it does help her as she begins to investigate the history of the ghosts..who they are,how they died,and darn it..why are they coming to Agnes for help and darn it..why didn't they cross over !!. it makes for a fun lighthearted who done what to whom ..and a very good read.. def recommend them..",positive

"“Half Moon Bay” was my first attempt at reading a novel by Alice LaPlante and oddly enough, I just couldn’t finish reading (or really get into) it. To be honest, I’m not sure what the problem was- meaning was it the storyline or the writing style. Regardless, I found it all to be a bit confusing. When I read, it is for enjoyment and as an escape, but if you make it too difficult (this one was filled with lyrical prose and complicated symbolisms) or the plot too hard to follow, I end up losing interest and will put it down. This happened several times while I was reading this story, until I finally didn’t care enough to even know how it ended.<br /><br />Initially, I thought that I would be able to get into the story (based on the book description). The main character, Jane, has a tragic past that involves the death of her child. In an effort to heal, she decides she needs a fresh start and moves to a new town, Half Moon Bay. Here she finds herself in the middle of a nightmare, that hits a little too close to home. Children are mysteriously disappearing, and while she is trying to rebuild her life (which includes a new love interest, Edward), she is moved to figure out who is responsible for taking the children and why. Ironically, this is where I lost interest. What should have been a pretty easy read (it is broken down into three parts: Losses, Trespasses and Love), proved instead to be a meandering tale told in the 3rd person, that left me of dazed and confused. Literally. There was so much symbolism and complicated (and at times) meaningless dialog that I just didn’t get.  I eventually gave up on this story. It just wasn’t my cup of tea.",negative

"This book seemed to have so much potential - bad things happening in the character's life, things out of her control and literally at rock bottom. Then she wins the lottery. Instead of being strong, finding her own way, using the money for good, she whines, hides, cries incessently, mopes around, grouses when her family asks her to donate some of the money to the local animal shelter. It's $87 million dollars and this girl can't find a way to enjoy it or get her life together without drama and angst every step of the way. I finally had to give up on this one 2/3 of the way through it.",negative
"I am fascinated with reality TV, so I enjoyed this behind the scenes look at what really goes on. The story line uses a common plot of boy meets girl, but girl doesn't want boy. Girl comes around and likes boy. There's a big misunderstanding and boy breaks up with girl.Of course, there is a lot more than that!  The story is pretty clean with some good chemistry between the leads who were both likeable. I did feel that it was a little too long at times, though for the most part it moves pretty steadily. There is a villain who gets more time then she should. There are a couple of minor characters who could have probably been merged together to simplify things a bit. I found this entertaining and overall a fun, light read.<br /><br />*I received a digital copy of this for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

"Allison's sister wants to have a breast augmentation before her wedding (a surprise for her future husband). What else to do but switch lives with her twin for a few days while she recovers without her fiancé knowing? After all, Allison and Ann are identical twins, and couldn't be more different. So imagine how Allison feels when she has to leave her life as a mild mannered scientist to be her sister, a free spirited redheaded beauty. She never expected a harmless prank to lead to complications for both of them. Determined to claim the love of his life, Spencer Raft, is willing to end a long friendship with his bestfriend to have what he wants (Ann).  Confused (about what she wants) and conflicted (about ruining her sister's plans), Allison yearns  to tell Spencer the truth, that it is not Ann he has been dealing with but her sister. Finally, forced to reveal the truth, Allison can't wait to see if Spencer's truly desires her or the image she has created.<br /><br />Although there were times that the story was a little corny and dated (she's a virgin and he's a man willing to deflower her...), Thursdays Child was a quick and easy read. And while there were times that I didn't always care for Spencer's attitude, or the huge mystery behind his ""career"" (that once revealed was stupid), I didn't have to think real hard and was slightly entertained.",negative

But he gives his explanations for the title.<br />All in all, I didn't see a lot that I would want to try in this book.

One of my favourite books to read each year is A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens and so when I came across this book last December I was intrigued! What a great take on a classic! I loved to hear a well known and well loved story from the point of view of one of it's main characters than is so often overlooked. This is one that will be read every year alongside A Christmas Carol and I highly recommend it!,positive

I am reading this now.  It is very funny and insightful into the life of a Jewish boy growing up in very unusual circumstances.  His youthful interests were also unusual to say the least.

Thank goodness he followed his heart and found his genius.,positive

"To be fair, this was the first ""comic book"" I've read since I was a child, since long before comic books became graphic novels.  I think the old comics were better.  You could tell which frame led to which frame.  Stories were completed or at least stopped at a good place until the next issue came out.  Or maybe I've just been too long a reader to get any great thrill from looking at pictures.<br /><br />I expected anything written by Joss Whedon to be very special, like Buffy and Angel, but this was, instead, very sophmoric.  Maybe that is the function of grapnic novels, for adults with talent to have some kind of sophmoric outlet, like laser tag or paintball, like the old pulp magazines which provided light reading for people whose reading tastes were usually very serious; I'm talking Zane Grey to Proust.<br /><br />I'd like to think that any reading is of some value, but this . . . ?",negative

Paul Goble has written a very nice story about a girl who loved wild horses and eventually roams with them.

"It was a struggle for me to review this book because there were things that I liked about the story, but there were a bunch of things that I didn't like. I struggle between giving the book a 2.5 and a 3. I feel the underlying plot was good (abuse, racism, sister with issues, husband who cheats with sister, motorcycle lover for sister, amputee, evil deceased grandmother and a host of other interesting characters), but I think there were times when the long, graphic sex scenes, could have been eliminated in order to have build better character development, instead of throwing it in during the last few chapters in the book. I think the novel would have been better if we were allowed to see why the husband felt he was ""addicted"" to sex (all we THINK we know is that he had an absent father and a dead mother)and if the ""wife's"" issues (she doesn't appear to enjoy sex)would have been clear before the last two chapters of the book. (Hey, you knew she had issues, you just didn't know what the cause of them were. However, when they were revealed, it seemed rushed and confusing.) Maybe if Dickey had used the last few chapters to be the beginning of the book, and built on that, through a series of flashbacks, it would have been a smoother read.<br /><br />Overall, I am not sure that I would recommend this book to anyone, but if you were to pick it up and read it on your own OK. I only read it because it was my bookclub's selection.",negative
"This is a new author to me. I wasn't sure what to expect. While I did find it to be a bit predictable, I found it also to be engaging and entertaining. It was an easy read and would be a good beach read. Many of the chapters are pretty short, which works well for busy readers since there are many stopping points, however, I kept reading and finished it in less than 2 days. There is a lot of drama going on which reminds me of a made for TV movie. There's conflict, friendships, and even a little romance. The descriptions are well written and now I have a sudden desire to visit Sag Harbor. I am also interested in checking out other books by this author.",positive

"I enjoyed reading this thin book from cover to cover. This is a basic guide that lists the fact that there are different types of pollinators from mason bees, bumblebees, hummingbirds, moths, bettles, bats, etc. It explains the importance of habitat variety and the value in planting a succession of blooming plants throughout one's landscape. The idea is to provide food, nesting areas, and water for a variety of pollinators without using any pesticides and by reducing lawn space.<br /><br />This book is not a how to guide on setting up the landscape but a basic guide on what one might consider in setting up that landscape.  The appendix in the back has a list of plants. It is always best to buy the plant using the latin name to ensure it is native and not a hybrid plant that is nutritionally poor or a nutritional zero.<br /><br />The one glaring error in the book that was not caught by the proofreader is on Page 88. It says to make hummingbird nectar the standard formula is ""one part water to four parts sugar."" That is NOT TRUE; in fact, it is the reverse. It should be one part sugar to four parts water which means one has to dissolve 1/4 cup of sugar to every cup of boiling water and let it cool completely before putting it in the feeder.<br /><br />In summary, this guide is a good basic start on how to create a pollinator's habitat that includes a smorgasbord of plants, nesting areas, and water all without pesticides. After reading this, it is clear that additional reading will be necessary elsewhere.",positive
"There are four women at the center of this novel. A mother running from her past, and her estranged daughter. A local woman who befriends the mother, and a lonely 90 year-old woman. None of these women have any redeeming qualities. They're all broken, and none of them learns from their past mistakes. I'm not sure why the author has such a negative attitude about women, but I definitely wasn't in the mood for this kind of in-your-face bashing, or the totally unsatisfying ending. Couldn't at least one of the women get her act together?",negative

"I had high hopes for this novel and at first it had a sort of Bridget Jones' feel. Then you get a few more chapters in and realize that despite the lies and silly choices, Bridget Jones was clever and sweet with real heart and this book just falls seriously short.<br /><br />Percy James is so busy wallowing in her own self inflicted angst that she has zero compunction about lying to everyone in her path - her boss, the new boss on an interview, her mother, her friends, her almost fiance, a potential new love interest, and herself. There's just a sense of selfish carelessness in the way she treats people that rankled from start to finish. Some chick-lit just isn't great and this book is an example of that.",negative
"What a disappointment. The initial blurb on this book had all the things I like in a story.... A post apocalypse future, fun advanced technology and a mystery. Yet, the entire story was just so scattershot and drifty that I lost interest quickly each time I picked up the book. I tried four times to read this and just couldn't finish it - I simply had no connection to any of the characters or the plot.<br /><br />Nothing is really explained or described completely. The opening pages show a very vague idea of the &#34;Feed&#34; and how the population is fully addicted/integrated with it, but there's only one scene in a restaurant and then the story leaps five years ahead after a terrorist attack. There was no real exploration of the Feed&#34; based civilization so the loss of it just feels sudden and meaningless. The current environment is never fleshed out fully either. We get the impression that life is austere and starvation lurks around the corner, but it's sort of an afterthought.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the lead character, Tom is pretty unlikeable. He comes across in the first pages as emotionally abusive and controlling with his wife. My dislike of Tom never abated. The rest of the characters are pretty flat and one dimensional. Life is simply too short to spend with tedious books.",negative

"I love translated novels as you learn so much about the history and culture of the author.  This novel is no exception, but often the intended flow of the novel is often lost in translation.  So it is often tougher to read, but the completion often leaves you spell bound: worth the effort.  A beautiful book set in Hungary in the 18th century where the culture of one particular family is played out in the male linage where members crossed over to other religion for the sake of love, from rich to internment, of cultural and religious revolutions compounded.  Although many of the characters have a brief stay in the author's eye. You, none the less, get a glimpse of a moment in their life, be it their most tragic, their most humblest, joy mingled with lost or something just so out of the ordinary.  I have mention that this novel takes you through the human emotions and life's experiences like a high speed roller coaster.  Humor is peppered through out, but overall, a book of family legacies seen through the eyes of the male linage and history galore.",positive
"Artistically inclined Robin is drawn into the mystery of the cranky old woman next door and a beautiful young girl who seems to be held against her will. Twelve-year-old Stella and her mother are refugees from Cuba, and Stella's overbearing grandmother treats her like a helpless baby because of her blindness. In defiance of her grandmother, Stella constantly wears a beautiful emerald and diamond pin in the shape of a star, a gift from her (dead) Cuban grandmother. Robin senses that more is at stake when a mysterious, unpleasant stranger shows up at the Devery house searching through rubble and sneaking around, but is preoccupied with trying to find a subject to sculpt in clay so that she can enter a sculpting class by a talented local artist.<br /><br />Although dated, ""Secret of the Emerald Star"" is another wonderfully engaging, crisply written entry in Phyllis A Whitney's long list of excellent juvenile mysteries, which are all sadly out of print. The book makes an honest attempt to deal with ethnic and religious discrimination, a 1960s view of the Cuban crisis, and (for the time) forward thinking about dealing with blindness. The author includes a brief chapter on the inspiration for Stella's character and of her conversations with blind adolescents in preparation for writing the book, as well as the inspiration for Grandmother Devery's stuffy Staten Island neighbourhood that labels people as ""Cubans,"" ""Catholics,"" and ""Jews.""",positive
"My copy of this guide was dated copyright 2003.  Possibly the reviewers who gave this book a 5-star were reading a revised issue, maybe 2011?  Because I cannot understand how this book got a 5-star rating.  Anyway, here is my review.  The 2003 version did not have adequate illustrations, nor story lines of USA submarines.  Nothing.  It talked about unnecessary details in obscure functional parts of one or more submarines.  No history grouping of subs was given.  Nothing into early creation, middle wartime uses, and current nuclear subs.  Just a bunch of mish mosh!  No mention about grouping a various classes of subs. So, my guess is that the author(s) thought these were &#34;trivial&#34; items to learn.  Maybe?  Uses of submarines in USA war was not clearly discussed.  Written by experts for experts?  Maybe?  I came away with the idea that I was still an idiot as to the value submarines played in USA wartime.  Oh yes, me!!  I was the idiot.  Maybe in 10 years I will understand this book.  Oh, sorry, my mistake, the title did say Idiots Guide, right?<br /><br />My suggestion --&#62; Get another book, if you can --&#62;  U.S. Submarines in World War II: An illustrated History of the Pacific.  At least, that is what satisfied me as to my HUNGER to learn about submarines.  The illustrations and chronological examples were excellent.  Written by Larry Kimmett.

"MURDER ON THE LEFT BANK (AN AIMEE LEDUC INVESTIGATION) is the 18th novel in this series.  One can’t argue with success, but the last two (of three that I’ve read) are pretty much interchangeable, except for the specific Parisian locations that Aimee visits.  Aimee gets a client, or a puzzle to solve, then runs around Paris investigating, carrying wigs and hats as superficial disguises.  Now that Aimee has a baby daughter (Chloe), she constantly phones or visits home with concerns over the baby’s welfare.<br /><br />In the novel, Aimee must locate a dead man’s notebook that reveals money laundering transactions by dirty cops.  The notebook was stashed somewhere by a young man who was murdered because he stopped for a romantic liaison on his way to delivering the notebook safely to the proper authorities.<br /><br />To succeed in her notebook quest, Aimee must reconnect with her disgraced policeman uncle—the one she shot and put into a hospital with life-threatening injuries.  Aimee herself becomes a target of the murderers; another mother’s baby is abducted when mistaken for Chloe.  One of the more interesting locations on Aimee’s Paris itinerary is the Gobelins tapestry works.<br /><br />The novel is reasonably well-written, but the characters aren’t particularly well developed (this was done in previous novels, I think).  The plot has twists, but it’s built around Aimee’s visits to various Parisian locales, and it’s mechanical.  I think this is my last Aimee Leduc mystery, as I’m not all that interested in the Paris neighborhoods.",positive

"Having sampled Shepherd's THE SOLITARY HOUSE and found it a fairly interesting mystery despite not having read the Dickens' novel that was its inspiration (BLEAK HOUSE), I thought I would give this newest effort a try. I'm sorry to say I found it a less-than-stellar knockoff of DRACULA. Victorian investigator Charles Maddox visits Baron Von Reisenberg in Austria to see if a donation promised to Oxford University by the Baron is legitimate. Instead he finds Von Reisenberg's name strikes terror in those whose homes surround his castle and the homestead itself is a place of horror. He escapes only by being confined to a hospital with a fever. But once back in London, he discovers the Baron has arrived there as well.<br /><br />Shepherd's description, especially in the first third of the book where Maddox is in Austria, is haunting and atmospheric. You feel the penetrating cold, witness extraordinary and terrifying sights, shudder at the atmosphere of evil which permeates the surroundings. The problem is that the story itself doesn't live up to the descriptive language, and frankly Maddox isn't a very appealing protagonist. I was also bothered by the fact that this is the second novel of Shepherd's that I've read that features terrifyingly brutal things happening to women; some of the narrative is extremely hard to endure. Since I haven't sampled her first novel or the one that preceded THE PIERCED HEART, I'm not sure if this is a regular feature of her mysteries, but for myself twice is enough. I won't be ordering another one of her books again.",negative
"I received this book as a gift from my dear daughter and I appreciated it and enjoyed it -- up until page 119.  There, authors Dutcher's release their version of CWT  -- Critical Wolf Theory.  No, they don't use that term but their anti Christian message is crystal clear.  They write, ""With the rise of Christianity... it reached a population [Europe] that increasingly envisioned itself as separate from nature.  It couldn't have helped that Christians adopted the motif of God the Shepherd.""  No, Mr. and Mrs. Dutcher, Christians didn't ""adopt"" the motif of God the Shepherd.  The 23rd Psalm, one of the most beloved and moving scriptures, was GIVEN to us by God.  Christ himself said, ""I am the good shepherd."" (John 10:11)  Shepherding was a common occupation during Biblical times and it was something everyone could understand; and yes, wolves did attack flocks of sheep; and yes, the job of the shepherd was to protect their flock.  It is a symbolism that I, and billions of people, cherish.  Never in my life have I imaged this symbolism as a basis for hatred of wolves.  In fact, I support wolf reintroduction, I have ""adopted"" a wolf at NWF, and I give regularly to NWF.

"What a cookbook!!!!!  I have never read a recipe book in such detail. The stories the author tells are extremely amusing, very lively and enjoyable.  The finished recipes titillate the palate with such wonderful flavors.<br /><br />Although stated otherwise on the book jacket, I feel the recipes take quite a bit of preparation.  They may be simple in the sense that they have few ingredients, but the preparation takes time.  Also, some of the ingredients are so rare or hard to find that it was almost impossible to make them without some form of substitution and I live in a pretty urban area.  My local supermarket that has both extensive international and organic aisles did not have some of the ingredients.  In some cases, substitutes are suggested but in others they are not.  For instance, I could not find farro anywhere locally; although Amazon does sell it.<br /><br />This cookbook is definitely five stars but I had to lower my rating to four stars because an attempt is not made to explain some of the ingredients and finding them is so difficult.  For the seasoned cook who lives in or near New York City or Los Angeles or the person who does not mind ordering ingredients online, then this will be an invaluable recipe book.

"Jerry Grey, the viewpoint character in TRUST NO ONE, suffers from early onset Alzheimer's disease.  He is a best-selling mystery/thriller writer, and his rapidly advancing Alzheimer's is causing his real-life memories to merge with his fictional plots that involved brutal murders.  On his good days, Jerry &#34;remembers&#34; maybe shooting his wife, and believes himself responsible for at least one more murder that he must have committed during a blank period when he managed to wander away from his nursing home.<br /><br />The plot of TRUST NO ONE is full of twists, sort of.  The twists depend upon Jerry's memories, which shift and change as his disease progresses and regresses.  Following the plot, and trying to decipher which of Jerry's memories reflect things that really happened, and which are figments of his Alzheimer's-impaired mind, is simply too much work for me as a novel reader.  At the end of the book, I think I know who killed whom for what reason, but I'm not absolutely sure.<br /><br /> I have no idea whether this novel accurately reflects the thinking processes and feelings of a person suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease.  If it does, then those thoughts are too jumbled to interest or entertain me.  I think that TRUST NO ONE would be a much better book if the author had not tried to enter the mind of an Alzheimer's patient in order to tell the story.  As it is, the book's story takes far too many words to tell.  I rate TRUST NO ONE at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative
"This book was in the romance category, and that's why I choose it, but to be honest I think it was misplaced. It really was more of a fantasy. It's about a girl who is chosen to be the Dragon, or wizards, servant/girl/pupil for a decade. She is described as ridiculously clumsy, always getting dirty. He just seems mean, to be honest. He's always yelling at her and mean. Some bad, dark things happen, which really did not appeal to me such as them having to burn a bunch of poor cows who'd been taken over by dark magic. It just seemed really dark. there certainly did not seem a whole lot of romance to it. The one thing I can say was that the writing was competent. It did flow well and was written professionally. Still, it was not a book for me.",negative

"I was unfamiliar with the author and not sure what to expect at all, but  I was pleasantly surprised with this book. It was fast paced and engaging. I've been busy, so my reading time was limited, but I made a point to carve out some reading time every day for this. The characters were well developed. They weren't too predictable. There is a lot of description and often there would be multiple paragraphs without any dialogue.I tend to gloss over those at times when I'm short on time, so there were some occasions when I had to go back and reread a little because I missed an important detail. I didn't always agree with the paths that the lead character was taking, but overall she was likeable and I enjoyed reading her story. I will definitely be checking out other books by Bethany Chase.",positive
I really didn't enjoy this book that much. It didn't have the thrills and twists that her books usually have.,negative
An interesting fantasy and perhaps would be comforting to those having trouble dealing with loss. It was just a little out there for me and perhaps not real enough to hold me.,negative

"I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella book for years. I found this to be an entertaining and engaging story. The story line is a bit familiar and predictable, but I still found it to be a page turner. Fixie, the main character, starts out as a weak, door mat kind of a person. She does find her back bone and inner strength. There are some misunderstandings, infuriating siblings, and a coffee sleeve in this romcom.",positive
"There is little of Inspector Sejer in the first half of the book and it is far from the police procedural that draws this reader to Fossum's work. I could not tolerate the main character's endless whining and self-pity. I couldn't bring myself to care about him and only wanted him locked up and shut up.<br /><br />Such misery! A gloomy story told from the perpetrator's POV. His state of mind, in all it's denial and self-centeredness is explored thoroughly. He disappoints his 16 year old daughter and breaks her heart over and over.<br /><br />Try one of the other titles in the series and you will be hooked:<br /><br />Inspector Sejer / Inspector Jakob Skarre series:<br />1995 - In the Darkness; English translation 2012<br />1996 - Don't Look Back; English translation 2002<br />1997 - He Who Fears the Wolf; English translation 2003<br />1998 - When the Devil Holds the Candle; English translation 2004<br />2000 - Calling Out For You; American translation: The Indian Bride, 2007<br />2002 - Black Seconds; English translation 2007<br />2004 - The Murder of Harriet Krohn; English translation 2014<br />2007 - The Water's Edge; English translation 2009<br />2008 - Bad Intentions; English translation 2010<br />2009 - The Caller; English translation 2011<br />2013 - Carmen Zita og døden<br />2014 - Helvetesilden",negative

"Good Account of Hillary Rodham Clinton's childhood.<br />As a child, Hi!lady liked to play boy games like ice hockey.  She studied hard and went to good schools.  She lived in a suburb of Chicago and in Pennsylvania.  As this book ends before the 2016 election, Hillary becomes a senator for NYS, First Lady of the United States, and ran for president in 2008 and 2016.

"Bern and Melvin met in Philadelphia in the early 1960s and fell in love, but things go seriously awry and they must flee the United States, chased by an FBI agent as they head to Ghana where Mel's old college roommate is now President Nkrumah.  Twisted into this adventure is the reality that Nkrumah's power is against the USA's political interests as he has aligned with the Russians. A coup is in the works. Further twisted into this adventure are some mystical scenes surrounding Bern's heritage that is somehow tied in with mermaids and water; Melvin and Bert joining with a famous musician who has also had a key encounter related to water and a mermaid; and their journey, with the band,  toward President Nkrumah during chaotic and dangerous times and chaotic and dangerous weather.<br /><br />Bazawuie crafts a compelling tale and plays the mystical parts just right.  I did not find myself liking any of the characters at all.  Yet the characters were compelling. Bern is the least unlikeable and presents a strong independent female persona who is most interesting as a child when her grand ma dies.  It is rather unclear what she ever saw in Melvin, who is sympathetic in some ways but also seems to be a mess from the start.  Oddly, the FBI agent chasing Bern and Melvin is someone you -- don't necessarily root for -- but you take an interest in how he will make out.  While there is humor in this novel, there is also violence and pain.  I would say my primary emotional reaction to it was mild depression.  Interesting. Worth reading. Really well told/written.  But hard to finish and feel fully satisfied.",positive
"I have read around 100 pages and just can not get the rhythm going. Again and again I get the feeling that this novel is written by a B class writer.

"I did not really care for this book and I wouldn't read it with my child. I felt that it had some poor lessons in it. It stars out about talking about how most teachers are strange... when you are working hard to get your kids to respect teachers, I don't think that's a great way to teach. So the teacher, who seems to be a witch, then teaches the kids with her magic, but I find many of the lessons to be poor. Like how she uses magic to cheat and get them to win a game. It shows other teachers in a bad light trying to catch her doing something bad and she retaliates against them. It is extremely short with large print and pictures so even if you like it, it is way shorter than the chapter books. I'll be looking for a different series.",negative
I got this book to read and look at with my 2 year old granddaughter who loves cats. We both enjoyed the little stories and pictures.,positive
"Yes, it is gripping - and, yes, it is well written - but could I find a character that I liked?  Sorry, I get turned off by a mother who screams the f-word at her 7 year old child - no matter what that child may be up to.  And a father - who is molded to be the perfect husband and father - a supportive, loving, romantic husband, and a piece of jello around his obviously mentally-challenged daughter who is able to manipulate him with ease.  And, the daughter, whom any reader will accurately diagnose as deeply troubled and dangerous from the outset.  Reading this novel, is akin to waiting to observe a train wreck you know will happen.<br />The daughter, Hanna, is seven and she does not speak a word, except the occasional “nasty” to her mother - which her father never hears.  She must have been exhibiting troubling behavior from a very early age - and it is a bit unbelievable that these parents have allowed this to escalate as long as they have - without the serious intervention of medical professionals.  Sending her to school really blows the mind, but these parents try it time after time.<br />So, as much as the pages turned, the mind turned as well, wondering if the author should have done a bit more research on dangerous child behavior and come up with a more believable set of circumstances and solutions.  If this was to be a thriller showcasing  parental problems with childhood mental illness, we didn’t need Crohn’s Disease or architecturally green design.<br />Yes, I felt the ending was setting me up for a sequel - giving Hanna another shot at destroying her mother.  I think I’ll sit that one out!",negative
"Trust me, read this book if you are looking to drastically improve your gym performance. I've been working out for a long time 10+ years and decided I should take some advice from the pros. Lots of great info during the first half of the book to help improve your workout and nutrition knowledge. This book is based of what actually works based on tons of studies and results. Each fact is cited based off the studies it was pulled from. I've dropped 8% body fat and 18 lbs in 4 months and looking more cut then ever. My friends have even noticed the drastic changes. Do yourself a favor get this book.",positive
"I loved how this book got off with a bang!  I was totally enjoying it the first couple of chapters.  But then the tone changed repeatedly throughout the memoir as though the author was still processing her very ambivalent feelings.  Mostly, what I found disturbing is how little insight this 40 something year old woman has achieved after all of her years on earth.  Blaming her good natured parents who do so much for her and patiently put up with her is hard to take.  At times, I wanted to smack her, for her mother's sake.  Enough already.  I can't recommend this book to anyone who is impatient with the immaturity often found in the boomer generation, particularly the childless who have never had to measure up in a child's eyes.",negative

This book was part of our survival unit in seventh grade. I was bored and anoyed the entire time. There was a lot of sitting in the crashed car and siting fallowed by more sitting.

"The title of this book led me to believe that this would be more [[ASIN:0060817097 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]] than a memoir about the author who marries and winds up with two stepchildren and a stepdog.  This memoir is 40% about the dog and 60% about the marriage.  Although I strongly feel that when you marry someone you accept them and their family (and yes that includes the dog) as a package deal, the author is of a different opinion when it comes to the dog. I really loved this book and the way Mireya tells her story. She is sometimes funny in describing the situation with Eddie the dog and her narrative is thought-provoking when describing the challenges she faced as a result of marrying someone who was already divorced and with a ""family"" of three. This was an easy read and just an overall enjoyable book.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this four stars is because the title is a bit misleading and led me to believe this was all about a dog.  However, it is a lot more than that but in a good way!",positive
"I was disappointed. I didn't find anything in the book that I hadn't already found during online research. It's more of a campground directory than a travel guide.

"I found The Ladies of the Secret Circus to be a captivating story. It's a dark circus themed fantasy that switches from 1925 to 2004. The story was fast paced and exciting. While the story wasn't a slow starter, I was pretty busy when I started it and it took me several days before I could fully devote the time to reading it. Then when I did, I pretty much inhaled it over 2 days. The characters were likeable and well written. I loved reading the descriptions of 1925 Paris. I am definitely going to check out Constance Sayers' A Witch in Time.",positive

Secondly, and specifically to the book itself, I really did not care to be bombarded with the tedious rendition of every single person to walk through Elton's musical career.

"At just 250-ish pages, Freed manages to infuse a significant amount of longing into this brief novel. The book is about young Cressida, her scandalous mother, her vacant father, and the benevolent neighbor who seems inextricably bound to all their fates. I truly enjoyed the intimate circle created in this book - the back and forth in tiny orbits, almost like the rest of the world didn't exist outside of a handful of main characters. This did make it a greater challenge, however, to remember when and where this story was taking place. We are supposed to be in post-WWII South Africa, but the setting fades to gray in the face of so much personal and domestic drama. I was generally alright with that, though I wondered if that would be true for all readers.<br /><br />I mentioned the theme of ""longing"" in this book. It's the one emotion I felt just emanated from every page - a longing to be loved, to be cared for, to belong. There are a few of what I consider ""throw away"" characters meant to forward the story of Cressida and ultimately her neighbor and benefactor, George Harding. But really, it's only Cressida and George I ever really cared about. I've seen their story compared to that of Pygmalion - the older, more experienced gentleman crafting a lower-class girl into polished womanhood. I understand - and mostly agree with - the comparison, so take from that what you will about the course of the story.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Lynn Freed's The Servant's Quarters, and was satisfied by the conclusion.",positive

"I am a HUGE Disney Fan. Except for the cover it doesn't have a very Disney feel. My strong recommendation is take advantage of the preview option and see for yourself. I think it would be ok for children ages 7 to 10, but would be more enjoyable in a school than a fun read at home. The content is rather dry and simplistic and the graphics are something I don't think Mr. Disney would be excited about.",negative

Nothing of significance happens, the mysterious Mr Black doesn't turn into anything, and even Mr Bellman doesn't really do anything interesting or go anywhere or grow personally, just goes into business, loses wife and kids to sickness, and avoids intimacy.  If you really want to read it, borrow it from your local library, don't waste actual money on this, it isn't worth it.",negative

"I am always open to reading a translation of such a book where it is a best seller with an established author.  With such an opportunity...What did I think?<br />First, I had to adjust to the cultural theme difference and allow myself to open up to the prose and angle of the author. For me it took me 1/4 way into the book to understand the jump from story telling to 'interviewing technique' from another character's angle...<br />Second, the key character was centered around Jenzhen, who had this amazing brain that could adapt to anything mathematics!<br />Third, it was a human assessment of how society could exploit such delicate souls with these extraordinary gifts, and then can abandon them ....it was a sad ending, and one that was depicted with much truth of how society works.<br /><br />It is not much of a thriller as we know it in the west.

"My first impression on page one was dislike for the main character, Nora. The story opens with the wife belittling her husband. This is a recipe for divorce without any other outside factors needed - belittlement and passive aggressive resentment characterized the entire marriage between Nora and Charlie.<br /><br />As the pages go on, the rest of their life is revealed and it's just ridiculous. An obsession with a parking space and some sort of implied prestige rendered by having the space opens the door to all sorts of bad behavior by everyone on the block. I just found every character to be shallow, self absorbed, unreasonably arrogant and out of touch with the real world.<br /><br />For me the story was very slow and not compelling. I found myself reading a chapter and just walking away. There was nothing happening that made me want to know what was next. I just felt annoyed by the relationship between Nora and Charlie more than anything else.",negative

"I had difficulties deciding between 3 and 4 stars. In the end, I went with 4 stars because I did like it. I have been a fan of the Pendergast novels from the beginning. They are not my usual genre, but I find them addicting! This one is definitely one of the weaker ones. First of all, Pendergast doesn't even make an appearance for at least the first third or more of the book. His chauffeur/right hand man, Proctor is the lead character during that time. I enjoyed reading more about him, but then he abruptly disappears in the story line for a good chunk of the book. The book is fast paced and exciting, but it felt like it was the same old story. I'm not giving up on the series yet, but I am thinking it might be time to retire the beloved Agent Pendergast.",positive

"After becoming vegetarian in 2003, I became much more conscious about adding whole grains to my diet, to the point of replacing white flour with whole grains whenever possible. In the past, baked goods with whole wheat and other grains were easily detectable as ""health food."" However, the talented kitchen staff at King Arthur has found ways to tone down whole wheat that pass as full-flavored, healthier counterparts of traditional favorites such as scones, pie crust, croissants, and other delectable goodies.<br /><br />The book begins, appropriately enough, with breakfast (porridges, oatmeal, granolas, waffles, pancakes, French toast, muffins and scones). After a hearty foundation, quick breads, muffins, coffeecakes, biscuits and scones are explored, followed by crisps, cobblers and puddings, flatbreads and crackers, yeast breads, sourdough, cookies and bars, cakes, pie and quiche, pastry, and a guide to whole grains.<br /><br />This is my first King Arthur cookbook, and I appreciate the fact that when they discuss kinds of flour to buy, they do not endlessly promote their own brand as the only choice (in fact, there are precious few mentions of King Arthur flours).<br /><br />If I had to choose one baking book to have in my collection, it would be this one. The clear instructions and healthier updates of many classics are crowd-pleasers, and the cookbook itself is beautiful to look at. This is the perfect gift for your favorite (health-conscious) baker.",positive

"Okay, so if you write a book based on one of the best loved classics of all time and then give it a life of your own, is that still called fan fiction? I have no idea what I was expecting when I read this book, but it certainly  wasn't dark and dreary Christmas. I know people are going to get mad at me for giving this book such a low star rating, but one of the things I judge my books on is whether I thought the idea was original or not. I realize that this author came up with his own story, but all of these ""based on"" books and movies we have come out with in the last few years make me wonder if we have run out of authors that can come up with their own ideas. No matter how you cut it, basing characters on another person's successful creation is still riding the coat tails. This one wasn't for me.",negative

What I thought would be an inspiring &quot;rags to riches&quot; success story turns out instead to be a biography of a guy with little direction who had a love for cars and boats. Richard's father, Grant Sr., appears to be the real inspiration in the family. It would be interesting to read a book about his life and his ascension to success and fame.<br /> Grant readily admits that his last name helped him.

"The author lost one of her premature twin sons shortly after birth and this book is about her loss. Her story and grief process is written in a chaotic style, many times fluttering from one thought to the next with limited cohesiveness. However, this chaotic thought process will probably resonate with those who have experienced the loss of a child, especially a newborn. Some of her story I could relate to even though I never lost a child. The reader will understand what it is like to experience thoughtless comments from those who know nothing of her misery or who want to avoid thinking about it because it causes them pain. I can relate because when my best friend (who also happened to be an ex-boyfriend) committed suicide by hanging himself in his bedroom, I was treated to thoughtless comments by others such as &#34;wow that must have been a high ceiling.&#34; Of course, there are those who react appropriately, but that is less often the case.<br /><br />In summary, some mothers who have lost a newborn or young child will be able to truly feel that someone else has experienced what they are going through. However, not everyone will relate to the chaotic style in which this is written. It is not so much a succinct tale from beginning to end as it is several short stories with jumbled thoughts thrown in-between that really demonstrates the upheaval and utter sadness such a death imposes on the mother.",positive

"Some of these I've seen before through Cook's Illustrated hacks and the like (using a Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with no mess), and some fall on the &#34;less practical&#34; side (like using foil as a roasting pan; if you're attempting to bake anything remotely heavy / messy, the foil will buckle and spill when you try to pull the whole thing out of the oven unless you're using a cake lifter under it - been there, made that mistake!).<br /><br />But for those with tiny or underequipped kitchens (including rental houses on vacation), there are some great lifesavers here that will still enable you to bake, poach, broil, etc., using repurposed kitchen items (foil, cake pans, etc.), along with simple recipes that illustrate / use the aforementioned techniques.",positive
"I don't know why I finished this book. I just hate paying  top dollar for a hard back book only to find it sucked. A very simple book, that reads like a ya novel that is quite repetitious. A boring plot, boring characters, not much else. I like a much deeper book and this author doesn't seem to be able to deliver that. Would not recommend.",negative
"The presence of suspense you can feel deep in your bones is what makes us walk around gripping the book, unable to put it down, eyes glued to every word for a clue to the conclusion, blood tingling at the end of every chapter...until that page is turned and  we are thrown a crumb that allows the roller coaster ride to continue.  Am I asking for too much?  I had all these thrills with most of the other Alex Crosses - but this one just didn't have it.  I enjoyed hearing about the early life with Maria, and how she died, but I got a little tired of the Butcher's scalpelous exploits.  Okay, we know what kind of a monster he is.  Didn't we expect that he'd get a little of his own surgery in the end, so to speak?  Probably performed by the mafioso?  I mean, come on, James - two shots from Sampson?  The guy was a barbarian, and I think we would have all felt better if the last scene involved a course taught by the mafia - Meatcutting 101?  Friends, I am really not giving away the plot, as you will know early on how this book must conclude.  Am I advising another book choice?  Surprisingly, no. You will be happy to know that Alex is finally at peace with the loss of his wife.  And, I think we all feel better for that, as we want the best for Alex.  We just can't expect a guy who puts out a jillion books a year to hit the hot button every single time.  I am still a fan, and will be waiting at the bookstore for the next one.  I loved Judge and Jury, went through the book-gripping thing, carried it around, felt the thrill, etc.  Just not this one.  Sorry.",negative
"I'm sorry, I feel stupid, because everyone on the end pages went on and on about the amazing writing and how good a book this is, but I just absolutely did not get it and would not recommend it.  Too long, too dark, and I think probably trying to do too much.  I didn't like any of the characters, I didn't like the story, I didn't like the plot, I didn't like much of anything except the idea of what I think he was trying to do and I hope he did and apparently he did for many people, but not for me.",negative
"I have enjoyed all three of the books in the Rosie trilogy. While the first one remains to be my favorite, this one is pretty good. When reading these books, I can't help by picture the character Sheldon Cooper as Don. I work in special ed, specifically with autistic children and I find the mannerisms and vocabulary to be pretty spot-on. It took me a lot longer than it should have to read this title only because I had difficulties finding the time to sit and read. It was pretty easy to pick up and read a little here and there. It was probably a little longer than it needed to be, but I'm not sure what could be left out. Anyway, I found this to be enjoyable and entertaining.",positive

"Twelve-year-old Catherine's autistic younger brother David is a constant source of embarrassment for her, from his hand flapping and public tantrums to socially inappropriate behaviors such as dropping his pants in public. Catherine is constantly updating her list of rules for David in order to spare him (and herself) embarrassment at the hands of others. Many of these rules make perfect sense to the non-autistic: knock before entering the bathroom, no toys in the fish tank, chew with your mouth closed.<br /><br />Catherine's best friend is away for the summer, and she's overjoyed when a new girl her age moves in next door, but she's afraid that David will mess everything up. She also meets Jason, a nonverbal wheelchair user who attends the same therapy clinic as David, and the two strike up a deep friendship, with the artistic Catherine going as far as to create new picture cards for Jason's communication book. Jason teaches her important lessons about acceptance and true friendship.<br /><br />Lord has created a particularly realistic novel that looks at handicaps and public perception, siblings, and the perils of preteen social angst in a down-to-earth voice. Catherine's family has its flaws as well as its warm moments, and David is a funny, adoring younger brother even though many of his actions are mysterious and frustrating to Catherine. Catherine's budding friendship with Jason was also tenderly drawn, and I hope that Catherine and the other characters will reappear in later novels.",positive
this book is smaller and thinner than the other books that have come out which is a big disappointment to me with the price..the cover is still nice but the quality just does not fit the price like books  have in the past.. if anymore come out Im not sure I would be interested in this cheaper version..Im debating about even returning it..,negative
"Letty Davenport is now a U.S. Senate Staffer connected to DHS in this thriller that starts as an investigation into stolen crude oil and where the proceeds are going.  All evidence leads to Jael, a militia leader with a plan she calls her ""Alamo.""  Jael and her followers want to stop illegal immigration and they are organized and ready to take it on directly. Letty, along with a DHS operative, John Kaiser are following the leads, and getting good intelligence from D.C., but it may not be enough to prevent a catastrophe.

the book gives some background on hedge funds and the various strategies in nice layman terms.  The second part goes into the various types of functions in a hedge fund from front to back office jobs.  And what the entry point would be if you were pre or post mba and those with RELEVANT experiences.  if you already have relevant experience then this book will be useless; if you have lots of experiences but none that fit the typical functions then this book is useless as it does not provide 'alternative' options for those who want to break into the industry.  great if you are still in colleage and want some good guidance of what is out there and how to break in to the industry.,negative

"This is my first book in &#34;The Kowalskis&#34; series. It's number 7 in the set. It is a stand alone book, but since I haven't read any of the others, I felt a little lost and overwhelmed with all of the characters - the Kowalskis are a big family! The story started off slowly, but it does pick up somewhere around the middle. The main characters were described well, but some of the others who were probably introduced in the other titles, were not described enough for me which led to my confusion with them. I liked the main characters well enough, but I did feel that Liz was a little weak sometimes. The plot is a familiar one - boy falls in love with best friend's little sister,  but best friend would not approve, so the two sneak around and try to fight the feelings that they have.There's humor, romance, camping/outdoors, and a little bit of heat.  Overall, I did find it entertaining and I did enjoy it.",positive

"Allright... I get it... the author has been previously established as an author of ""literature"" with all the verbose, over-wrought, self important conatations the term ""fine literature"" implies. As great as that may be in another genre, it just does not carry over well to Zombies. At least not in this case. The first time the author used the word ""interregnum"" I was dutifully impressed. Hey... it's a big word and an unusual one as far as daily use goes. But by the fourth time I saw in less than 60 pages, I was annoyed and put off. Meanwhile, the story itself was slow, slow, slow and oh did I mention...SLOW? I was hoping for a bit of brainy zombie survival and rebuilding of civilization. What I got was this lonely, self absorbed, bitter, below average main character and jerky plot movement that never flowed well at all. No explanation of when or how the plague started. Nothing about specific characters that made you want to care about them in the least. Mr. Colson Whitehead would probably do better to continue to write stories in different genres and leave the Zombies to guys like Joe McKinney (Dead City).",negative
"This was kind of a difficult book for me.  It is very timely and very poignant, and I think that having kids in middle and high school made this book touch home with me and at least my youngest son.  We had an interesting conversation about the whole phenomenon of school shootings and it was fascinating what he had to say and the fears that he had.  I know statistically... but it is a sad fear that he had.  After that discussion I put the book away and no one else read it.  I'm not sure I'm ready with all the answers yet.<br /><br />But to get to the book, I thought it was written well and the premise, like I said, is profoundly relevant today. The one thing I like the most was the focus on the survivors and not the shooter.  Books glorifying Columbine shooters have done damage and inspired several of the shooters.  This one focuses on the humanity and even the frank truth behind the stories that make it to the media.<br /><br />The writing is OK as are the characters but the resolution is rather good.  I don't want to give anything away, but I felt that it was worth getting to the end of the story.",positive
"A stand-alone historical novel, this tells a theoretical construction story of the technology behind neolithic standing stones building, as the subtext of the main personal drama.  Interesting tribal intrigues and the characters held my interest most of the time.  While I liked the book, it wasn't as close a fit for the author as the historic novels set in medieval Briton.  Even so, a worthwhile read that is quite enjoyable.",positive
"Not a well written novel. Very immature and childish, as well as selfish and lacking the empathy needed for a good author. Pretends to understand the farce behind ""femininity"" but really promotes gender binaries and doubting women's stories against men's.",negative
"The Secretary is the first book that I have read by this author. I found it to be engaging and well written. It starts out a little boring, but it has a steady pace. It just details the work and relationship of Christine (the secretary) and Mina (her boss). Christine is a loyal and obedient employee who does everything her boss says. Mina is a demanding boss. I would consider Mina an abusive (mentally & emotionally) person. Things happen that allow Christine to see Mina for what she really is and decides that it's not okay. I read the book over the course of a few days. I did enjoy it and had difficulties putting it down. Things were wrapped up pretty well in the end, but I felt a little dissatisfied with the ending. Overall, it's worth reading.",positive
"I discovered this series of books at the library."" Dear Pen Pal"" was the first one that I read (it's actually third in the series), and I was hooked! I could hardly wait to read the others, because references were made about events from the first two books in ""Pen Pal"".  I've now read all five, including ""Home for the Holidays"".  This is a great series of books, especially for this day and time. There are no instances of smoking, drinking, or sex. The characters have crushes, and an occasional kiss, but that's as far as it goes.(Very unusual for recently written books!)  The characters are modern teenagers who all have endearing as well as annoying qualities. Their personalities and interests are varied, but they are still friends and share the common bond of being in the book club with their moms. I especially liked how the moms and grandmoms that were in the club were involved with and cared about all of the girls, not just their own offspring.<br />  I think this series would appeal to readers of the Baby-Sitter Club books.  Girls who have enjoyed those books but are ready for a more challenging reading level would find ""The Mother-Daughter Book Club"" to be very interesting and easy to relate to, in my opinion. Hopefully, girls will be also be inspired to read or re-read books by Alcott, Austen, Montgomery and Lovelace, and perhaps even begin their own clubs. Thanks to Ms. Frederick for writing this wonderful series! I hope there are more books in the future!",positive

"The author is a naturalist researcher who studied the nesting behavior of tree swallows. He was mostly interested in answering the question of whether the swallows prefer white feathers for their nest over other colors and why.<br /><br />The entire text is extremely detailed in the sense that I felt I was watching the courtship, nest building, egg laying, rearing, and fledging of the tree swallows along with him. What I was bothered with were some of the methods he used for study. For instance, to be able to distinguish one female swallow he had trouble identifying from another he painted her breast and bill with a splotch of paint. He also continously removed feathers from the nest boxes of swallows and layed them on the ground to see their reaction. In two cases he introduced other bird's eggs into the nest box. He also peeked in the nest box periodically to check on progress.<br /><br />I do understand that research sometimes  requires unorthodox methods. However, the painting of the bird, introducing eggs from another bird's nest (not a tree swallow), and removing nest feathers bothered me. I do not believe in playing with nature like that for the purpose of study. I also feel it skews the research results. If he had just stopped at offering feathers, I felt that would have been fine.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading about his research even though it felt like I was recording every bird flight, nest building activity, etc. myself through his text. He certainly has tremendous patience and interest in the subject matter as should his readers if they are to enjoy this book.<br /><br />In the end,  he did learn more about the tree swallow than when he started but his initial question really requires more research for the results to be conclusive.",positive
"I was so excited to read this book, but the content was plain and extremely short. It felt more of a diary than poetry honestly that lacked value.

"I found The Moonshiner's Daughter to be a fascinating read. It's a historical fiction that takes place in 1960, North Carolina. The lead character, Jessie, is wanting to get out of the family business of moonshine. I found the whole story captivating and well written. It's paced well and I was able to read the book in just a couple of days. While I wasn't particularly happy with the ending, it was satisfying. This is the first book I have read by this author and would consider reading more by Everhart.",positive
"I found the first book in the Riches to Romance series to be a fun book, so I was happy to read this one. After a slow start, this book quickly became hard to put down. Things basically picked up after the location change. It's a fun, romantic story set mostly in Ireland. Tara, the heroine, is a Southern belle from Charleston. Although I really did like her, I felt that some of her Southern attributes were a bit stereotyped and not realistic. The chemistry between Tara and the two men was well written and engaging. I do feel like things wrapped up a little too quickly and that the passing of time was too short. Supposedly a couple of months take place, but it came off as just a couple of weeks. Regardless, I did find it a fun, light and fluffy read. I definitely want to read the next one in the series.",positive
"My book club read another Kim Boykin book a few years ago. I bought this around the same time, but just got around to reading it. What a delightful story about sisters and forgiveness! I started and finished this on the same day. I loved the friendship/relationship that young Nettie made with the two elderly sisters. There's a little romance, but that's not the main focus of the story. Boykin is a great story teller and did a great job of creating interesting characters and an engaging story line. I will definitely be checking into more books by this author.",positive

"I loved Riding Lessons - couldn't put it down, etc.  So, I was really looking forward to Flying Changes - and maybe expecting too much.  A couple of things really bugged me.  As a mother of five myself, I couldn't stand the way Annemarie constantly enabled Eva to be a spoiled brat.  Near the end, when what Eva's future will be becomes an issue, Annemarie should have made her clean up her own mess with Nathalie.  There should have been some humility shown by Eva. I kept waiting for lessons learned that would make Eva a better person. I found myself feeling so strongly about this that it distracted me from the story.  And,the story felt predictable and contrived to me.  The only real grabber, in my opinion, was Annamarie's disappointing birthday. I loved the atmosphere Sara created - she's great at describing the scene and putting you there.  And I feel comfortable with her first person, present tense style.  We can feel Annemarie's worries and pain - and her observations about her own physical shortcomings - or fallings - made me smile a lot.  I love the way Sara writes and I'll be looking forward to the next book.  Let's move on from Eva, though.  I just can't imagine that she's going to become a lovable character.",negative
"I have seen several of Barry Sonnenfeld's movies over the years and have enjoyed them. After reading the promo for this autobiography, I was intrigued and interested in reading it. It's a pretty easy read and very entertaining. I found some of it to be a bit choppy at times, but that may have been due to it being an advanced copy. Sonnenfeld is at least ten years older than me, but I found a lot of his upbringing to be something I could relate with. There were some disturbing parts, but overall it was a good read.",positive
"What an intense storyline. Layla is a strong but determine woman. She used to believe in love. After she is left to fend for herself and her 2 daughters, she feels the responsibility that comes with raising them and moving on with her life. She ends up moving into the Manor..the same one that has to be finished with the restoration and has its own ghosts....and this is where Laylas story begins. This story is so well written that as you read it you can actually ""feel"" what the characters are going through. There is plenty of paranormal activity that will have you believing and wondering if it's really possible. I highly recommend this q/series to everyone. Can also be read as a stand alone, but why would you want to miss the beginning of the story with so many secrets and shocking surprises?",positive
"okay, as an experience, this novel did nothing to tickle my brain cells and i certainly was not devouring it, as I would for mystery/thriller books.  For me the pace was tooo slow and torturous at times.  it does pick up half way throug the book, when I was just about to ditch it as I couldnt delay reading other books I have on my reading list.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple: doctor's confidentiality versus personal interest, back stabbing and self preservations.  Who do you trust?  the characters never really developed for me and hence the story fell flat even when I go to the end.",negative
I bought this along with a piggy bank for my 6 year old grandson as he will now be receiving an allowance!  He is reading very well and so I thought we would enjoy this introduction together.

"The things this book has going for it are as follows:<br /><br />Great dog stories<br />Great dog<br />Dog<br /><br />Let's face it, the most interesting thing about this memoir is how the dog interacts with the author and his friends and roommates.  More like a blog, I didn't care for the writing style, or for the repetitive reporting on beach house parties, cycling expeditions and whatnot.<br /><br />Yes, he does have an unusual bunch of roommates, and his experiences are stranger than fiction, but this isn't really surprising as the main criterion for selection is having someone to look after the dog.<br /><br />Billed as a memoir, we really don't learn very much about the author, except that his wife left him, he has a wonderful dog, and that he leaves the dog behind on a regular basis while in the pursuit of happiness.  It comes over as a rather one-dimensional look at a certain period of his life, and I really wish the author had fleshed out his experiences and provided us with more detail and depth.<br /><br />While this book didn't do it for me, it may be of interest to people who like golden retrievers, the singles scene, and first person accounts of bad roommates.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 2, 2010",negative
"I thought this book was horrible. If all you want to do is laugh about the problem instead of trying to correct it, then maybe this book is for you. However, I found the stories mean and not funny at all.<br /><br />The quizzes they had in there were far from helpful. I couldn't even relate to many because they reference TV shows I have never personally seen, not to mention situations that are so superficial it makes you wonder whether or not it is the mother-in-law that actually has the problem.  Some of us have to work and have children with no time to sit and watch television or worry about petty squibbles; we are trying to deal with the ""real"" family situations that allow people to rise up and create a good family environment.<br /><br />The only thing I could find in the book that made me slightly laugh were some of the quotes from famous people.  Other than that, the authors failed attempt at success makes me wonder if they do anything to try to make their mother-in-law situations any better or are just being cruel at their mother-in-law's and husband's expense.",negative
"This was a quick read. I started and finished within two days. The story is told in 3 different perspectives. For the most part, I didn't get confused with all the changes in characters. There were a couple of times where I had to back track a little for clarity. There are lots of unexpected twists as well as a surprise ending. I wasn't thrilled with it how it ended, but it caught me completely off guard which makes it a success. I would classify this as a  psychological thriller.",positive

I've never seen a wall calendar this small.<br />On top of this, when a calendar has a title on the front, such as ""Dogs"" you expect to see a different photo of a dog on each page, not one dog and the rest all different kinds of animals. That's what this calendar has. One photo of Hampton Court Palace and the rest pictures of other places. One page has a picture of palm trees, one page has a pagoda and a barge.

But this is the first time I've paged through a cookbook and thought that almost everything sounded bland, too simple, etc... They take this &#34;5 ingredient&#34; thing seriously too, if you want to have a recipe that is literally how to cook potatoes in a crock pot (ingredients: potatoes. Instructions: poke holes in the potatoes and let it sit for hours in a crock pot) or one that tells you to stick a pack of hot dogs in a slow cooker, then this is the cookbook for you!

"I prefer mysteries and dramas. This was mentioned in a magazine I read religiously so I trusted their suggestion and purchased this book. Apparently, no one at the magazine bothered to read the book prior to recommending it. It was a great page turner, grabbing you from the beginning -- that is, until about Chapter 7. That is where it turned bad. I really disliked reading what the last half of this book contains. It is as if the author relinquished the pen to someone else as the writing style changed and the plot and characters were depicted in a completely different light. I would not recommend this book to my family or friends. Granted I do admit it started beautifully.. but the ending.. meh.",negative
"""Unseen"" by Karin Slaughter is only the second novel I have read by this author.  The first (sorry, I cannot recall the title) was great--fast-paced, intriguing, and not a Will Trent book.  Like that book,  however, ""Unseen"" takes place in Macon, Georgia, and has many good, bad and truly evil cops in it.  It was a slow read at first, because most of the characters are cops, and there is just not enough variety, at least for me, to make it interesting.<br /><br />The exception to this is Dr. Sara Linton, who is in love with Will Trent, an undercover agent in this book who is likewise in love with her.  Unfortunately, he is still married to Angie, who is said to be mentally ill, so he is not free to pursue a relationship.  Another character, Lena, is a police officer who is hated by the reader but loved by her fellow police officers.  This disparity is incomprehensible.  Lena was Sara's deceased husband's partner on the police force, and Sara blames Lena for her husband's death.  Although she is not at all likable, she adds a great deal to the novel.<br /><br />In this novel, Sara thinks Lena is trying to kill her own husband, Jared, who is Sara's stepson.  This four-star novel has many twists and turns as the other police officers think Lena can do no wrong.  A reviewer in our local newspaper  recommended this book, but commented that it is very helpful to  have read the previous Will Trent books.  I completely agree with this.  You will be much happier with this book if you have read the other books in the series.",positive
"I have always thought of Fodors as more a reference than a book I would want to read from cover to cover.  We got both this and the DK eyewitness guide to Italy and DK is far better at getting you excited about taking a trip somewhere and Fodors is better for finding a hotel in an area you know you are going to.  Rather than the DK's highly visual pages, Fodors is text content heavy.  It is fairly good at being exhaustive for food and lodging and does fine with the sites of an area, but really lacks the beautiful photos of DK.  There are some good maps, but I'm not going to carry this book of restaurant and hotels around for the maps.  It is also not nearly as good for flipping through as the DK.  Both have value for sure, but this would be a second choice for a guide.",positive
"This is such a fun series to read! The main character, Valentine owns a beauty salon. Now, other than listening to town gossip, you might think its a boring life right? Well not when you have a hunky sexy man (Jock) to look at everyday,even if he is one of your employees lol...and hes definatly  not gay. But excitement usually comes to Valentine in the form of dead bodies, and stalkers who want you dead. Then theres the sexy macho detective Romero who is wondering how Valentine keeps getting mixed up in these problems. There are some quirky fun characters in these books. There are funny moments that will make you laugh out loud, gasp at danger and wonder which hunk should she choose?  I highly recommend this set because it will not disapoint !!",positive
"This gorgeous ode to Istanbul’s timeless cuisine recalls Rebecca Seal’s “Istanbul” in its photo-heavy layout and simple, straightforward mezze that can be assembled at a moment’s notice. From the embossed cover to the vibrant street scenes and mouthwatering food, this is a visual delight. Predictably, mezze star prominently, particularly yogurt-based dips and salads, pide, sigara boregi,  along with some stellar stuffed vegetables, kebabs, lamb and seafood. Sweets include apricots with clotted cream and walnuts, a pistachio baklava, orange and filo cake, and a Turkish bread and apple pudding. A gorgeous illustrated glossary rounds out the book. The next best thing to a plane ticket to Turkey, the city is as much a star as the food. I loved that every photo and restaurant mentioned also has a address listed, so you could theoretically use this as a guidebook on your next trip to Istanbul!",positive

The fusion of gentrification and horror in a graphic novel format sounded really intriguing. Sadly, I don't think this book delivered on its promise at all. The story was slow moving, even tedious at times, and was often confusing. The ""horror"" seemed far more silly than scary. The real devastation of gentrification, the way it destroys entire poor and working class communities to make way for people with more money and power, was never even touched on. The visual design also disappointed. The monochromatic color palette seemed bland to me. The ""sound effects"" left me scratching my head. Then there was the apparent cubist influence in how the characters were drawn, distorting their appearance in ways that put me off and that distance kept me from caring about them at all. The idea of this book held great promise but its actual delivery failed on every level for me.",negative
"I got this book thinking it would be a fun introduction to the King Arthur story/mythology. I learned that I have absolutely no interest in this mythology - the Round Table, Excalibur, Knights, etc-etc-etc. While it would maybe appeal to someone interested in the Arthurian legend, it left me bored silly. The writing was fine, appropriate, and there were a few chuckles, but it was a disappointment. I trudged through and finished it because I’m stubborn and hate to abandon books, but if I want another story about this period/subject - I’ll watch a Monty Python skit instead. Not recommended.",negative
The volume is too loud. Please consider adjusting! Buy beware!,negative
"This strikes me as something you would need if you only had a slow cooker to work with.  Most of the recipes can (and probably should) be done on a stove or in an oven.  There's not much that specifically addresses the unique features of a slow cooker.  It's more like something that demonstrates that you can use it in a pinch, maybe in a dorm, and still create nice meals.  Just not up my alley.",negative
"This book is full of fun projects to make with with your 3-D printer. Projects uses free browser based software to build things. The projects have a lot of color pictures and diagrams. The instructions are well written, though they do seem a bit advanced for kids. Older kids (high school) may be able to use the book on their own, but younger ones will need guidance. It's a great reference tool for STEAM activities.",positive

This is by far my favorite book in this series to date! I love the adventures that Lilly is thrown into. there are not as many characters to keep track of and is much easier for me to follow. In this storyline there is a lot of mystery and some &quot;catch your breath&quot; moments. I certainly recommend this book for all mystery lovers! !!,positive
Possibly the most disappointing cookbook I've ever seen. Some of these recipes aren't even recipes.,negative
"I tried to like this book, but it just wasn't possible for several reasons. There's literally not one character worth caring about or rooting for. These women are simply psychos with zero redeemable qualities. Just awful people on every front.<br /><br />The very premise of only collecting the inheritance if both sisters were present was interesting, but immediately failed. A visit to the courts with the death certificate would have solved things quite easily. However, I was willing to ignore that and settle in with the story. My last straw though was the scene where an 11 year old girl beats a dog to death. Nope - it wasn't even remotely germane to the story. I didn't bother with another page.",negative

"I know it's my fault but the size of this coloring book should not be hidden down in the 'product dimensions' section of the Product Details are, eight lines down. So utterly disappointed and disgusted getting a 5&#34; x 8&#34; coloring book when every other coloring book I've bought have been full size 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; coloring books. These pictures are small, cramped and hard to color. The size should have been openly disclosed in the main product information. I blame myself but also the publisher. Even worse? This and the other two surprisingly small coloring books were chosen from the back of [[ASIN:1574219952 Good Vibes Coloring Book (Coloring Is Fun)]] which is a full size coloring book but even worse a good third of the content of  this 'Color Cool' book are IN the Good Vibes coloring book. We bought them full size and now we have them in miniature. What a waste of money. We get to color the same pictures twice, joy. I'll be far more careful in picking products from this or any other product. This was another terribly disappointing experience.",negative
Total Waste Of Money<br />This guy simply took references and pasted them in this small book with NO PHOTOS and no real professional writing.  &#34;Pot the seed and don't over water&#34; - Really?

"This book had the potential to be great.  Instead it falls short of the mark by a wide margin.<br />Although the book provides a sound framework for developing and deploying solutions, it has a major flaw.  Throughout the author raises interesting issues in the form of rhetorical questions, then ... nothing. Quite disapponting.  Had the questions been followed by solutions or recommendations, then the book would have both substance and value. Substance by stepping up and providing viable answers and solutions to problems faced when developing and implementing internet solutions.  Value by saving us from having to discover the answers on our own, wasting resources along the way.<br />The whole point of buying a book such as this is to benefit from lessons learned.  It is frustrating to realize that the book could have been a valuable resource had the author only taken the time to provide answers to the very questions he raised.",negative

"GROWN-UP ANGER:  THE CONNECTED MYSTERIES OF BOB DYLAN, WOODY GUTHRIE, AND THE CALUMET MASSACRE OF 1913 purports to be a “cultural study”, but it’s so personalized--starting with an opening (18-page) chapter about the author’s gut response (at age 13) to Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone”--that it reads like a memoir.  Starting from that remembered response, author Wolff embarks on an epic quest to discover the source of Dylan’s anger, and recounts all the details of his quest in this book.<br /><br />Wolff settles on the anger source as the “1913 Massacre” that Woody Guthrie sang about (because Dylan used Woody’s same melody in “Song to Woody”).  The massacre was a real event, in which 73 children of striking copper miners and 1 adult suffocated in a Calumet, Michigan meeting hall stairwell.  Someone opened the hall doors and yelled ”Fire!” (a false alarm), and then anti-strike men held the exit doors shut from the outside so that none could escape.<br /><br />However, to take this single event, and Guthrie’s song, as the source of the anger expressed by folk singers in the mid1960s (as “have-nots”, against the “haves”) is a stretch, to say the least.  If anything, author Wolff's “revisionist history” shows that you can always find apparent “connections” between things, if you try hard enough.  Wolff tells us (in chapter 1) that his four years spent at Harvard College were wasted on him, and I would agree.",negative

"This saga has to be one of the worst series I have ever read in my entire life.<br />The thing that really irks me the most is Bella has no hobbies or talents that contributes to the story. She's not a black belt can't fight James even a little. She's not smart she can't come up with a way of out witing the evil vampires, all the story is is Eddykins I love you and all that mushy poop. She dosen't have any friends it's all Edward, Edward, Edward.<br />I would recomend this series if you could get a 1 cent coppy for the fallowing: Do you have a chair with one leg too short? Are you out of toilet paper? Trying to start a fire? Cat litter?",negative
"Change the name Laura To Disney, Grand canyon or where ever it is you have been and you would have at least the same story if not a better one. It is just a boring vacation in a costume.

The author didn't find herself just a bunch of life stuff happened like it does to us all.",negative
"This book is more for a parent and a child. Something cute to work on at the kitchen table.<br />What you see on the front cover, is all they show you. The book looks like it should be so much more. Plus I was fooled by the price of this book. Way over priced.<br />I wasn't happy with his purchase. Sorry",negative
"It's hard to put my thoughts about this book into words.  I remember when the Wild Cards series first came out and the fun of stories about super-humans who were also often quite ""human"".<br /><br />I knew since the back cover writeup on this story suggested that it was ""inspired"" by the online RPG City of Heroes that there was a danger that it would have issues with character creation and development.  The fact that it was a multi-author effort also was something I was concerned about as the original Wild Cards would have wild variations in quality depending on which author wrote a particular chapter.<br /><br />This book affirmed all my fears, unfortunately.  Character development is sparce and by the time I got 150 pages in I realized that there wasn't a single character I cared about.  Usually I can find one, even a villian to be interested in, but here, I just wanted to see the story move on.<br /><br />The villians were effectively faceless goons in metal suits, which only added to the ""I really can't care about anyone."" attitude that built up.<br /><br />Finally I set the book down, and I know I will never pick it up.  Its just not worth the effort.",negative
This book was not what I expected. I was very disappointed!,negative

"There are books that are poorly written - not this one.  There are books whose characters are so loosely drawn that they never breathe for you - not this one.  There are books whose plots are so convoluted and inane that you would like to pull the writer's fingernails out one by one - not this one.  But this one delivers the ultimate let down.  After you have paid the price, gone through the anticipation, been gripped by the story, made quiet, uninterrupted time to savor it, it waits until the last five pages to give you absolutely no satisfaction. No ride into the sunset, no bullet between the eyes for the bad guy, no real peace for the good guy, no logical ending...just one big, cynical fizzle.  And getting the fizzle at 11:00 PM when you've been waiting all day for that chance to get things wrapped up, is a serious fizzle.  Not one soon to be forgotten.  How could you do this to us, John?  What a disappointment. I gave it one star for the quality of the paper.",negative

"At first I wasn't sure who the targeted audience was for this DK book. I thought it might be geared toward the caregiver or family of someone with dementia. However, after reading through it, I decided it's geared toward the person with the memory loss. My Dad is 79 years old. He has started having some minor issues with his memory, but his mother did have either dementia or Alzheimer's, so we are thinking ahead. I think this would be good for someone such as my Dad, who is possibly on the edge. It is not an activity book with puzzles or games for the user to complete. Instead it has colorful photos and ideas for various activities that the user can do such as simple fitness activities, gardening, crafts and such. The book is well written. The layout jumps around a little bit or at least overlaps some. There's a lot of good information provided. Some of it seems more obvious, however, if you are having memory loss issues, it may not be. Overall, I think it's a good book and worth a try.",positive
"I'm glad other people like this book, but I seriously thought it was the worst thing I've read in a very long time.  It took an excellent idea and made it into this long tedious whiney fat girl soap opera angst ridden crap fest.  I almost stopped reading the book several times, but I believe in giving an author every chance to redeem him or herself.  This author did not.  If you're looking for a soap opera, this is good stuff for you.  I've you're looking for a science fiction modern novel about the possibilities of the future and the unknown worlds of the dead, this is absolutely a huge waste of your time and money.  Sorry, but this book just heaves.  I would literally take it from a friends hand in a bookstore and refuse to let him buy it, it's that bad.  Do not waste your time.  There are so many good books out there, and it's a shame when a piece of work like this one actually gets good reviews.",negative
"First of all, I read this without realizing it was the second in a series. However, with that being said, the book did a pretty good job of filling in the blanks when needed. The book started out as an easy read. It's kind of a mean girls book and I quickly grew tired of their mean girl pranks. I have never been crazy about that story line and found it difficult to read after that. My sixteen year old daughter read it to and she enjoyed it, though she felt it was geared toward a slightly younger audience. It has some good descriptions and interesting characters. Overall, I would recommend it as a fun teen read with the preface that it is a mean girls story for those who may not like that.",positive
"This is a beautiful book.  It has a nice story and lovely illustrations. The story introduces the reader to Saint-Saens' Carnival of the Animals. There are spots to press that play music.

"Maybe we can blame this one on Peter de Jonge - because I didn't like the ""The Beach House"", either.  I thought the characters were thinly drawn - and I really couldn't get close enough to them to care much about them. And, I felt strongly  that the story took place in an entirely wrong setting.  It was like staging West Side Story in West Palm Beach.<br /><br />  Despite the above, I am a huge James Patterson fan, own all his hardcovers, and salivate when I hear a new one is coming out.  Rarely does he let me down.  But, this time, I have to agree with Publisher's Weekly - this one was thrown together in time for the ""beach reading"" season - and even though there is an ""aha"" twist at the end, by the time you get there, you don't really give a darn.",negative
"Great good fun, Lovin' Spoonful style.  If you're like me -- a lover of lists, charts, and favorite band behind-the-scenes career nuts and bolts -- you're likely to really get into this one, too.  A truly worthy follow-up and definitely recommended to hardcore Spoonful fans.",positive
"Start by saying I love Lucas Davenport books. BUT this is not even close to the best of them. I miss all the people we are used to, Del, Shrake, Jenkins, Virgil, Sandy, Rose Marie, & even Weather (who I could do without) & the governor. The Bad Guys are given way too much time - they aren't interesting at all, unlike most of Mr. Sandford's criminals. The plot is very sketchy & pretty uninteresting. Letty is a little flaky as usual & that part was ok. It is worth reading but don't look for the usual ""can't put down until the last dog is dead"". It is easy to put down, but also easy to pick up again. So, I am again waiting for the next Prey book & am pretty sure it will be back to the best ever mystery series. We are all very interested in what Lucas is going to do now that he is out of the BCA, & hoping that it doesn't mean that the series is ending!!",positive
For people who built million dollar businesses you would think they could afford to pay a legit editor. I'm no grammar expert but there are so many blantant errors in this book it was BRUTAL to try to get through. Wish I would have opened it back when I bought it so I could return it.,negative
"This book was comically horrible. If you want to buy it so you can laugh at what you will read, you might be on to something.

It astounds me that this was able to see print.",negative
"I had such hopes for this book when I started reading it.  It begins with the story of the ""accidental"" discovery by a couple of Bell Labs physicists of the cosmic background radiation, confirming a theory that had recently been developed by Princeton cosmologists.<br /><br />But sadly, the author never really got himself going.  He seems to swing between excessive interest in the ""soap opera"" parts about the rivalry between competing groups of researchers, and ineffectual attempts to explain the science.  He struggles even to explain simple concepts and theories, perhaps because he himself doesn't quite understand them.  I struggled through the book, but at the end felt that the author hadn't taught me a whole lot.  Excluding the discussion of personalities & rivalries, I would summarize thus: ""Many scientists struggled for years to figure out that the universe is larged dark matter and dark energy, but we don't have any idea what those things are, and the theories are incomplete.""<br /><br />Other criticisms: Among the annoyingly odd things in the book, he tries to describe graphs without using any pictures at all ... why?  I myself would also have liked some representation of the mathematics, because I believe that many of those interested in this kind of topic has had at least some math & science education, and the others can ignore them.  But I'm aware that publishers think that the poets will be put off by the very appearance of any symbols anywhere in the book.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book at all.  I wish there were one that dealt better with this topic, something as good as Stephen Hawking's books (or George Gamow's books from a long time ago that explained modern physics of that era).",negative
"Halfway through the repetitious first chapters of this book, something compelled me to turn to the last page, where I found an Author's Note about a personal tragedy that had evidently inspired him.  Since, I, too, have lost a child, it's difficult for me to see the ""tribute"" in writing about a personal loss, encasing it in a psychological thriller narrative and saying it was written for the bereaved parents.  Perhaps the reading of this Note colored my understanding and possible enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />Aside from the above, three things drove me nuts.  First, the repetition, second, the obvious parallels Gross draws to the Manson murders (some of us remember that horror all too vividly and, and will find memories very quick to return) and the ending, which leaves the ball of twine purposely left unwound - to be tied up in a future book.<br /><br />How much mileage does Gross plan to get out of this personal tragedy?<br /><br />Gross is a good writer - his characters are believable and well-described; after a sluggish start, the plot moves and pages turn. If this is all it takes to reach the bestseller list, so be it.  I was sorely disappointed in the whole effort.",negative
"Fascinating POV’s of four self-absorbed women with way to many secrets. Lauren and Jenna are sisters and very close. Lauren lives in London with her husband Ed and 16-year old daughter, Mack. Jenna lives on Martha's Vineyard with her husband Greg. They have a dysfunctional relationship with their mother,  Nancy. For me the story missed the boat by not having more Scott time and not having less Mack time. Mack lost me forever on page 104. Lauren lost me a few pages later. I thought the 3 adults were more of a hot mess than teenaged Mack. I am clearly in the minority because 95% of the readers loved it.<br /><br />I was excited to read this new to me author with an eye catching cover and a locale where I spent the summers of my childhood with my parents and 2 sisters.

I would have been better off listening to Irish on the radio because the beginners' CD doesn't bother to break down the language; it starts at about sixty miles per hour and doesn't get any better. I accomplished more with a Hippocrene phrase book that didn't have a CD. I've learned three foreign languages and for each of them, the student is taken through steps; we learn the pronunciation of the vowels, consonants, and blends, which the Hippocrene book did. Then the student is given simple phrases (eg ""What time is it?"") at a slow or moderate pace, and we continue to build on the given theme.

"GREEN LIGHT FOR MURDER is a smart-aleck-y mystery/thriller, told mostly from the viewpoints of a damaged detective who spouts horrid doggerel (Tommy Veasy), and a crazy serial killer who is directing a movie about his murders with the help of an imaginary film crew (Jay Braffner). Once you get used to the oddball presentation, it's a fast and entertaining read.<br /><br />Washed-up and certifiably insane filmmaker Braffner is getting revenge against old director colleagues who stole his ideas for zany movie murders.  He's carrying the murders out in real life, all the time shouting camera directions to his adoring (and nonexistent) crew.  He's also murdering other people who happen to cross his path, chalking them up to ""collateral damage"", and pretty much leaving their bodies where they fall.  Braffner is a weirdly organized/disorganized killer.<br /><br />Braffner plants a plastic explosive in one old enemy's telephone, but simply cannot get the director to pick up the phone for the detonation.  This running gag keeps the reader turning the pages, and even had me rooting for Braffner by the end of the book.  Because the book is fun, but Veasy's doggerel is so awful and unnecessary that I ended up skipping it entirely, I rate GREEN LIGHT FOR MURDER at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  Tommy Veasy is fine as a series detective, but I don't want to read any more of his ""poetry"", even if the damaged Veasy does need it to keep functioning.",positive
"Thank you so much to NetGalley.com and BooksGoSocial.com for my copy of “My African Craving” by Audrey Flynn. This book was fabulous from beginning to end and like an African lion, I devoured it in one sitting.<br /><br />The author certainly does not waste any time before throwing the reader right into the steamy action. I love books that have strong, well-defined characters and especially ones with an independent leading lady (girl power right?) and this book does not disappoint. Right from the opening page, through to the last, the writing is fresh and fast-paced and will leave you wanting more. <br /><br />The main protagonist of the story is Erica Knight. She is a high-flying executive for a big mining company, that arrives in Lebombo Game Reserve with a view to negotiating mining rights there. Thinking she will be able to walk in and out with an easy deal, Erica is certainly not prepared for the reserve’s enigmatic owner, Jean-Luc de Graaf, who turns out to be more than just a hot Game Keeper in khakis.<br /><br /> This book has everything that a romance reader could want. It has passion, adventure, a landscape to die for and most importantly a great storyline. I promise you it's not just Africa that is hot in this book; the chemistry between the main characters is on fire and you will be left fanning yourself long after the final page has been turned. I loved this book so much and cannot wait to read more by Audrey Flynn.",positive

Phones can now function as your media player, personal planner, and portable gaming system all in one. Many phones and other small devices today are orders of magnitude more powerful than the first mainframe computers, which took up an entire room of a building.<br /><br />If any of this got you thinking or even curious about technology, give this book a read. You don't need to be a ""hacker"" to understand it. Most of the articles are written for (and sometimes, by) people who are not themselves hackers.<br /><br />Overall, a great value and great stories contained within.",positive
Too many pointless side journeys for this to be a well written novel. Sometimes I thought it should have been written for Field and Stream magazine.,negative
"Comment is NOT in reference to the seller or shipper. This book title popped up on my son's 9th grade summer reading list. I purchased all the books with the design to give him all options during the summer. I found reviews for all the books except this one. Have mercy, I know why! My son came out shaking his head, handing me the book, saying &#34;There is no way my school really wants me to read this crap.&#34; Assuming he was trying to make an excuse to get out of reading the book, I picked it up and started to read. All I can say is this is the WORST book I have ever read. If it is an attempt to get black girls/students to read, I am offended. The author perpetuates ugly stereotypes of violence, hyper-active sexual attitudes, sexual pressure, racism and entitlement attitudes, and the assumption that all white girls are 'hoes' and all white boys are rich and looking to add some color to their parties at their parent's beachfront mansions. Disgusting. How dare an author encourage such filth. Don't allow your children to read this book. It is written by a narrow-minded woman using her book series to 'settle some score'.",negative
"Not for the beginner at all..unless you really want to slave over it.  But for the intermediary and up, these are a great collection of the 80's pop scence!  Great for guitar and piano, and the lyrics are included.  I wish it was on a comb binder, but for $8 you can get it bound on a comb from KINKO.",positive

"What I mean is, one of the main characters has a talent that the main character in these types of stories (don't want to spoil it) and the focus isn't really on him (I can't remember if it's in the description or not), at least not in this first book.<br /><br />The characters were well-fleshed (I wanted to smack a couple of them, which is a good thing. It means I got caught up in the story) and the plot was well-written.",positive

"The bear-shaped board book ""edition"" is NOT the Corduroy story. It shouldn't even be listed as the same book. The original story is cute and poignant, and I highly recommend it. But the board book has no real narrative; it is just a list of things that Corduroy does one day. There are no other characters, no dialogue, no conflict or issues, no rhyming, nothing but ""Corduroy is mailing some letters."" and ""Corduroy takes a bath. Look at all the bubbles.""  The illustrations, while nice, aren't original -- they were culled from other Corduroy books.<br /><br />The book is cute enough, and my 17-month old daugther loves it because it's oversized and bear-shaped. But I was disappointed not to get the actual Corduroy story, and would not have bought it if I'd known what it was. All that said, if your child already knows and likes the original Corduroy book, this might be a nice companion.",negative
"I am new to Sharon Shinn's writing and loved the four books of the Twelve HOuses.  This is the first of the angel books I""ve read, and while the concept is interesting, i found the heroine to be so irritating it was hard for me to wish her well. Which is why i rated the book so low. Still better than many fantasy books but I like her others so much better.",negative
I do not like books that go back and forth and only feed a little bit of the background information at a time. But that is me. I thought the book would never end.

"This is a lovely, depressing and highly readable book about the devastating loss experienced by a family when their older daughter Kathy dies just before she graduates from high school.  Espach writes it from the point of view of Sally, Kathy's younger sister.  Together, they shared confidences, particularly about Billy Barnes, Kathy's crush from fourth grade on.  Their parents were loving and had a good marriage and their life in a coastal town in Connecticut was picture perfect.  Each family member and, oddly, but for good reasons, Billy Barnes go through the next fifteen years experiencing this loss in different but deeply painful and life-changing ways.  Each is stuck on some aspect of the loss, the perfection gone, but life goes on, but what does life look like when it goes on?  This is also a love story between two sisters, the sisters and Billy Barnes, parents and children and husband and wife. Kathy is ever present in one way or another -- in dreams, in stories, in her casket, at her grave, as a storm.  The arc of the story is so perfectly drawn, the writing emotional and  sometimes funny, particularly when it comes to getting into the brain of a growing teen (Sally) and her romantic escapades and adventures with her  best friend Valerie.",positive
"Buyer beware. I guess I thought at $15 this would be a regular size book. Of course, shame on me for not looking at the dimensions. This is a small almost pocket sized book with limited information in it pages are small with large type most with black and white pics).

Disappointing, terrible purchase.",negative
"I will not go into a lengthy diatribe about why I did not enjoy this book. To do so would be to reveal all of the quirks it has and include a lot of spoilers for those who have not read it yet. What I will say is that this is one of those ""Oh come on, no one is going to believe that!"" kind of books. I found myself rolling my eyes, shaking my head and asking myself why I was even bothering. I got 2/3rds of the way through and realized these were moments of my life I was never going to get back. I moved on to another book.",negative
"Maeve Binchy has always been in my top five authors. I loved her previous works enough to start collecting them. When i bought this book I settled down with a cup of tea and prepared myself for an enjoyable afternoon. Boy was I wrong. This book was nothing like the previous novels I had come to expect. From the very beginning it was confusing, boring and overwhelmed me with too many characters with no real value. I kept hoping that it would start to make sense and the storyline would emerge, but it just never happened. I finished this book on the stupid rule I have about never leaving a book half read and gritted my teeth through the pain. the book had a beautiful cover and an interesting blurb on the back, but just as I have seen with theater previews...that may have been the best part!",negative

"If you absolutely have to &#34;read&#34; this, based on bad-accident syndrome, for your wallet's sake pick it up at the public library.  I have seldom come across worse writing - the whole thing comes across as generated by a computer on Ativan.  ZERO character development, dismally bad &#34;plot&#34; development, huge gaping holes in what presents itself as a narrative line, and lays the trail for the inevitable book three so blatantly as to be offensive.  Ms Trussoni has some interesting ideas but no skill at all as a writer, and whoever posed as editor either for this or its predecessor needs to be sent back to school.  Not even engaging enough to be depressing, just BAD.",negative
"I was unfamiliar with the ""My Encyclopedia of Very Important"" series by DK. My kids grew up on the bigger, thin DK books that were filled with photographs. I immediately noticed that this wasn't the same as the other series. However, it's still an excellent, quality book aimed at younger readers. There are illustrations as well as photographs. Text is larger than in the other books with basic, to the point information. The material is interesting and engaging. I found my 17 year old daughter reading it for over an hour the other day, so it can appeal to a wider audience. I would recommend this title and others in the series.",positive
the 14 year old in the family did not care for the ending - he said it didn't fit with the first 140 pages. I read it first and felt that everyone got gypped -it was like a slap of realism on top of a tragedy that had potential to be terrific.<br /><br />Publisher's Weekly and Kirkus reviewers loved it.,negative
"These are bright, cheery bookmarks for students. The librarian at the middle school where I worked last year kept a display of bookmarks for the students to take and use. These are comparable to the ones she would buy in bulk. They are lightweight and not particularly durable, but they do the job of marking one's place in a book. The edges are smooth without any perforations. These are perfect for school or classroom use and are appropriate for readers of all ages.",positive

"This is a pretty interesting book about Method Acting. It has been often used to define American acting in the 1950s and 1970s, my favorite decades for acting. The 1960s had it wane then begin gaining strength with Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. I miss the love of acting and see most mass market movies as not being acting at all but humans just augment the special effects. The book is most interesting at the beginning and the end, the middle is more of a confusing muddle, which I believe happened The Method.",positive
"Several of my friends from my book club recommended this book to me and I finally had some free time to sit down and read it. It was an engaging story about a young woman in the 1770's trying to save her family farm. There were some religious references & lots of prayers to God, but it wasn't preachy by any means. The story was fast paced & had plenty of adventure as well as romance. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The characters were likeable & I am looking forward to reading the next story Feeding on Ashes.",positive
"Earlier this summer, I ordered the excellent &#34;[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general, especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form, this is an excellent, informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted, stir-fried, curry), dals, grains (pilaf, flattened rice, upmas), breads and pancakes, numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes, chutneys, and drinks, sweets and desserts. From what I can tell, &#34;Vegetarian India&#34; appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements, so if you already own &#34;Curry Easy Vegetarian,&#34; you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely, user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine; highly recommended.",positive

"There's a lot I could say about this book, but I think 'tried too hard' sums it up quite nicely. Tried too hard to be clever, tried too hard to be suspenseful, tried too hard to pull on the heartstrings, and all in the wrong ways possible. I should have closed the book after the first few pages. The big red flag for me was actually the part you read in the sample. Just take a moment and reflect on what you, as a normal human person, would so if some little kid came up to your door and handed you a letter from your SO. You'd read it, right? Just take it from them, open it, and give it a read. Even if you had some weird niggling feeling in the back of your brain that you're not going to like what's on it, you'd just read it. But no. Let's take how many pages for her to reflect on this letter, the absurdity of a little kid delivering it to your job, and what that all might mean. WHO DOES THAT? And she approaches everything with the same degree of laborious reflection. It's exhausting. Who lives their life like that? Plus, throw in the fact that you, and older, more sophisticated adult, understand little about technology. Come on. My 82 year old mother knows the difference between a pager and a cell phone. Just... ugh. Exhausting. Not even fun exhausting. Just exhausting.",negative
"So many good reviews I had to take it up.  Read in one sitting. Disappointed.  Borderline angry with myself.  So many metaphors for so many things.  It asks me to forget any wrongs committed by any race and has a notion that one race deserves a wrong, others have every right to commit a wrong and others will invite the wrong into their fold and become friends.  Sorry, if anyone wants my copy send me a note.",negative
"This is a fun book. My 4 year old is dinosaur crazy, so any book with dinosaurs is right up his alley. I expected more of a hidden picture type book. Like Where’s Waldo. But this isn’t that. It isn’t difficult at all. Nothing is really hidden, there are just specific things on each page to find that are right there in plain sight. For a 4 year old, that is awesome. For an 8 year old, it is boring and far too easy and simple. The book is a pretty big book. I think as long as your using it for a preschool aged child, they’ll love it. My 3, 4, and 6 year olds all liked this book. My 8, 10, and 12 year olds were too old for it completely.",positive
"This was my first Michael Palmer read, and from the accolades, I was expecting something exceptional.  Resistant had an exceptionally imaginative premise, a good story that moved right along, characters that were well-fleshed out, settings that transported, but, instead of enjoying the novel, I was distracted by the political aspects.  It was difficult to read without feeling disappointed that the author of a really good book had to make his political leanings so apparent.  I've read many a non-fiction book dealing with present and past politics - and I enjoy them for what they are.  I expect to deal with the political bent of the writer.  When it comes at me packaged as a novel, I don't anticipate feeling defensive while I'm reading!<br />So, I didn't finish the book, which is a rare thing for me.  If you don't share my delicate sensibilities, you will probably enjoy this book.  It is well-written, and I can understand why it was well-received by the publishing community.",negative
"I enjoy reading health books and books about healthful ingredients for the mind and body. This recipe book contains recipes ingredients that are designed to give a person a healthful glow and keep them looking younger. However, the healthy advice is really for the entire body.<br /><br />I read this cover to cover and made a couple of recipes so far. I usually prefer to eat my food and drink water most of the time. In essence, I am not really a smoothie person. However, the ""yellow"" smoothie I made (see first two pictures) came out good.  I should have used water instead of milk. It called for a plant-based milk but I used regular milk and that is not really a good idea when lemon is involved in the ingredient. Nevertheless it tasted good.<br /><br />I also made the miso with mushroom, sweet potato, and tofu soup (last two pictures) and that was delicious. I would have reduced the miso paste by half, however, because I found it salty. Of course for these and the other recipes I will be trying, I had to buy all sorts of stuff I did not have in my house, like tofu, dried mushrooms, miso paste, vanilla powder, ginger, etc.<br /><br />After reading the recipes, I would make about 15% of them. To me a book is a keeper if I find two good recipes in it and there are more than that in this text. However, these recipes are not for everyone. I had to be willing to go beyond my comfort zone in mixing all these ingredients together. I normally eat very healthy but Asian-influenced and smoothie-based staples are not something I carry in my house nor am I use to eating at home.",positive
"The Last Resort was not at all what I expected. I have been swept up in the psychological thriller genre recently and was expecting something along those lines. This is more of a drama/thriller. It seems like it could easily be a made for TV movie.  It takes on serious subjects such as #metoo, mental & physical abuse, and more. It was fast paced and easy to read within the space of a couple of days. I liked most of the characters except for the villain. There are some unexpected twists that keep it interesting. Overall, I enjoyed it.",positive
"When I ordered FIRST PERSON: A NOVEL, I thought that the book-publishing aspect sounded interesting, and that it was a mystery/thriller.  Whatever book list I found it on, it was badly misclassified, because it appears to be a serious attempt at writing literature.<br /><br />It’s a first-person narrative, written in long, rambling sentences.  There is minimal punctuation--for example, conversations are reported on without all the bother of including quotation marks. The story is something about a ghost writer who’s failing at extracting information for an upcoming memoir from an infamous con man.  In all honesty, the book makes as much sense to me as James Joyce’s [[ASIN:0394743121 Ulysses]].  I cannot make head nor tail of it.<br /><br />Neither the narrator nor the prose is interesting enough to justify the effort it would take for me to figure out this book--what it’s about, or what the author’s intentions were in writing it.  I leave this much-praised novel to all the students of English literature who particularly enjoy reading “difficult” novels with expansive, all-encompassing literary themes.",negative
I am a chef that is always looking for plating ideas techniques and thought by the cover that it may do that.  This book has a lot of wasted space and does not provide very many things I had not seen in other cookbooks.  I would look at this in the store beofre buying it without seeing it.  Very nice idea though.,negative

"I found this to be a light, engaging story on a fresh subject. I loved the idea of the yearbook with all the mysterious notes inside it. I liked most of the characters. I especially liked Jeremy. Geneva was over the top, but a bit amusing at the same time. The chapters were short which made it easy to pick up and read in short bursts of time. I would classify it as part comedy, part mystery, a dash of drama, all with a little bit of romance.  I was a little disappointed in how the whole yearbook thing ended. I didn't feel a lot of resolution with that. However, I did enjoy how the story wrapped up. This was my first book by Elinor Lipman and I would consider reading more from her in the future.",positive

"This is an entertaining story about the life of a single woman and her experiences with online dating. Most of the chapters begin with some kind of texting or messaging with prospective dates. The dating life angle was fun and interesting. I did get a little confused at times with all the different characters. I had a week long break from the book at one time and had to go back an reread some parts to figure out how some of the people were. In addition to the many guys Alison dates during the year, there's also several friends, a brother, and co-workers to keep straight, too. I respected Alison and her dating limits. Overall, it was a cute story.",positive
The Be More Vader book is a cute DK book that has all kinds of tips and advice for the adult world. A lot of it is geared toward work/business. It's an official Star Wars item. Each piece of advice is a 2 page layout with a photo from a Star Wars movie on one side and the advice on the other side. My husband has been a Star Wars fan since the start and he found it to be amusing. I think this would make a nice graduation gift for a Star Wars fan.,positive
"This is not a review of the book but rather the format.  Not only is it huge, like 7x10 inches, the printing is like that of a textbook with double columns on each page.  I lost immediate interest in reading it as it is too cumbersome to fit in a purse and the text is so tiny, it's not an any-day-by-the-pool read either.  Also, the publication is The Two Columns of Hercules, and now I fear finding the same ill translations in this print edition as reviewed in the Kindle version. I expect this will sit on my bookshelf while I check my local library for a more traditional format.",negative
"SURRENDER, NEW YORK is a 604-page tome, densely packed with long, long sentences and flowery language.  The opening sentence is almost worthy of a Bulwer-Lytton award:  &#34;The case did not so much burst upon as creep over Burgoyne County, New York, just as the sickness that underlay it only took root in the region slowly, insidiously, and long before the first body was found.&#34;<br /><br />I like historical mysteries, and I'm generally not bothered by a 19th-century writing style that's adopted to create a period atmosphere.  However, the narrator in this novel is a psychologist who delivers lectures on the need to restore psychology and profiling to the &#34;positions of respect&#34; they occupied before forensics took over criminal investigations in the early 1990s.  To me, it's simply not credible that a 21st-century narrator would talk like Trajan Jones.<br /><br />I wanted to read this novel because I'd heard that the author's earlier work, THE ALIENIST, was very good.  Unfortunately, this one is simply too daunting for me.  Mystery/thriller fiction is my bedtime reading, and the sheer weight and length of the book makes it inappropriate for that.  While the writing will no doubt be effective at putting me to sleep, it will take me several years to get through the work. I give up, and I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative

"""My journey with Farrah"" is a book about how Farrah's best friend Alana helped Farrah during her battle with cancer--from the time she was diagnosed until her death.  It is written in diary form as if you were reading Alana's diary.  From Alana's point of view, you get an inside peek at Farrah's cancer battle.  The book demonstrates to me the love Alana and Farrah had for each other.  The story will humble you as you gain insight into how an extraordinarily beautiful and down-to-earth woman could be ravaged by such a disease.<br /><br />I've read most of the negative reviews about this book, but did not have the same reaction as the other readers had.  Although at times Alana can come across as selfish, I don't think this book would have been ""true"" had she not revealed her innermost thoughts that make Alana a human being like anyone else.  I commend Alana for voicing those thoughts even though most might recoil at them.  Since Ryan (Farrah's significant other for 30+ years) supported Alana in the writing of this book, I believe Farrah would approve.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book about Farrah's life, this is not it.  However, if you want to know all about Farrah's battle with cancer these last few years through Alana's eyes, then this book will give you a glimpse of Farrah's struggle along with what Alana's life was like during that time.",positive

Then 'Jade' (hmm, how many FBI agents are named Jade when compared to the same name of exotic dancers?). Anyway, she goes to her new position and we get more names! I guess I fell for the monthly 'Amazon Reads' again, choosing a most likely self-published story that I lost interest in by page 20. One easy tell about novice writers is that they choose such ridiculous names for their characters. And names are only important if these characters will continue on through the story.",negative

"I like mafia books. I like enemies to lovers books. I like second chances books. All signs point to me really liking this book. I just didn’t. I wasn’t my jam. It wasn’t horrible or anything, if it was I wouldn’t have finished, but I just never got anywhere with the book emotionally.<br />Haven was annoying? Needy? I don’t know what she was. This whole I hate this guy but I love this guy, I’m just gonna jump on him thing was difficult for me. I mean every time he did something that truly broke her heart her response was hatred but also sexy times. It was just hard to believe which one was real. Neither of them read as super believable. I don’t know that he really ever hurt her that much because she moved on so quickly and even in her POV I didn’t find her super believable.<br />Luca was a jerk. Mafia books usually have the hero be an anti-hero; they tend to be super violent, more than jerks, the books in general tend to be dark. I felt like Luca was trying to be this way but it didn’t read as super believable either, like he went through all the violent motions but in the next breathe he saved himself for years for the girl he walked away from. He just has some weird contradictions that I didn’t really buy into. Also he was a jerk when he didn’t need to be and it wouldn’t get him anything so that I didn’t get.<br />Also I’m not sure I super bought into the world premise with the Dark Kings. I don’t know, j just didn’t love this book. It was decent enough to finish but that’s all I got.",negative
"The sometimes secret and shadowy world of puppy mills is exposed by this book. You will be shocked at the horrendous way that some breeders treat their dogs.  As sad as the situation was and in some cases still is, the book shows that with a lot of money, patience and care, some puppy mill dogs can be restored to reasonable health and happiness.  Some can never be restored after years of abuse and neglect.  The physical abuse is bad enough, but puppy mill dogs suffer immense emotional abuse as well.  Only through the efforts of caring people can these places be shut down.  Many have been stopped with stronger legislation and the efforts of caring people, but I think the book makes it clear that we have to be ever watchful and not do things that allow the puppy mills to flourish.  Adopt an animal from a local humane society and don't insist on a purebred.  Mixed breed dogs are often just as wonderful than full breeds.  They tend to be healthier and often have better dispositions.  The book is an easy read at just 200 pages in my advance copy.  It's a good book for high school kids who might want to get active in protecting animals.  Younger children might be able to read the book easily, but could be disturbed by the terrible treatment that is described in the book.  A must read for any adult who cares about dogs and animals.  At the end of the book is also information on how you can get involved and make a difference.  Very well written and hard to put down.  You may well read it in a single sitting.",positive
"This was literally the worst book I've ever read, and the most offensive! It's like the author set out to purposely offend as many groups as possible! This book is full of incest, rape, homophobia, racism and anti-semitic language. I only finished reading it out of pure morbid curiosity. Also the general flow is extremely stilted, and the author should have taken a class on punctuation and writing before writing this book. If you really want to waste money on offensive filth, it's your dime, but I strongly recommend putting your money elsewhere. This book is also incredibly boring and rehashes the same point over and over until you just want to scream! A five year old could write a better book than this! SERIOUSLY!!  The only reason I gave this book one star is because it wouldn't let me give 0 stars!!!",negative

"I had never heard of Martha Gellhorn before this book. She was a war correspondent, journalist, and writer in the 1940's and on. She was also the ex-wife of Ernest Hemingway and a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. This book is a compilation of letters to and from her lawyers, lovers, editors, etc. It is amazing what one can learn from reading their correspondence. I found her letters interesting and it gave me a good breadth of the actual person behind those writings. <br /><br />This book took me several months to read in increments of 30 minutes to 2 hours per day and that is the best way I find this is read. For me, this is not one of those books I could read right through.",positive

Also, the print is so small, it makes it very hard to read.<br /><br />I'll try it out, but so far, I'm not impressed.",negative

Great book to use with children when talking about the power of positivity. Helps children realize that they can overcome challenges when they stay positive as well as make others day better when they spread positive energy. I used this book with 3rd and 4th graders.,positive

"This is a timely story with its app development theme. This was an easy read, but it was a little boring at times. The characters were alright, but I didn't love any of them. I think the premise was good and it had a lot of potential, but in the end it fell short. I did like it (not love it).",positive
"This is my first experience with grayscale coloring. As far as the coloring book goes, the paper quality is adequate. The images are okay - some are definitely clearer than others. It's hard to tell if some of them are blurry or if it's the result of the creature's scales, but some of the images have a pixelated look to them. I think the whole concept of grayscale coloring is neat. I just used colored pencils for my first attempt. It was alright, but I didn't have the results that I was hoping for. I plan to play around with other mediums. I think something that is blendable will be good.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My thoughts and opinions are my own.",positive
"I picked up ""Basket Case"" after reading about it on Amazon.com and I wasn't disappointed! I finished it over the weekend and look forward to reading more of Carl Hiaasen's works.<br />""Basket Case"" combines the gritty world of rock and roll and the recording industry with a pinch of romance, whodunit and death...lots o' death. Our leading man Jack Tagger writes obituaries and is obsessed with death, going as far as memorizing what celebrities died at what age, then seeing if he will outlive them.<br />At times ""Basket Case"" requires suspension of reality, but there are many enjoyable moments (the dead lizard in the freezer being one of them) as Jack searches for the truth about the death of Jimmy Stoma, lead singer of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies. Hiaasen obviously has a handle on modern pop culture as he drops current band names and trends every few pages and doesn't miss a beat. Carl introduces us to the newsroom, ravers, Ecstasy, photo shop girls who make secret duplicates of naughty amateur photos, industry scumbags with L'Oreal hair and thug bodyguards, a Courtney Lovesque widow bent on building her career at the expense of her deceased husband.<br />The plot moves along at a steady pace, and Hiaasen includes enough twists and turns to make things interesting every few chapters. Being a musician, I enjoyed the musical descriptions and aspects of the book. Lots of memorable characters and moments.",positive
"There is nothing good to say here...<br /><br />The artwork is bad for starters.<br /><br />There are 2 bookmarks per page and they are tear apart.  I don't think that this is acceptable for a bookmark.<br /><br />Plus, they are kind of short for a bookmark (only 5 3/4 inches, I should have paid more attention when ordering).<br /><br />The list price is $1.50, so not a bargain here.  It is currently on a 4 for 3 deal which helps if you like ugly, short, tear apart bookmarks...",negative
"This is the second of two American Girl stories about Maryellen. She's a 10 year old girl living in 1954. The story starts with Maryellen and her friends planning her upcoming birthday party. During this time, in world news, a vaccination for Polio has been created. Maryellen's family also takes a cross country trip over the summer before her sister's wedding. There's a lot going on in the story, but it is interesting and entertaining. The illustrations are beautiful. There's the usual historical info in the back of the book.",positive
"We are not trying Keto so much as we are trying to find more and better ways to use our inherited air fryer. I like the Keto angle though, it has brought up a number of good ideas.  Unfortunately a lot of the family is vegetarian so we are limited about most of the recipes (expected) but we knew this book had a vegetarian section and it lived up to our hopes.  We were immediately inspired to make buffalo cauiflower and it was an immediate hit. We are also excited to make eggplant lasagna once we can find decent eggplant... as well as frittatas, fritters, stuffed mushrooms.  This is great since mostly we have been french air frying sweet potatoes and potatoes and that is about it.<br /><br />The cookbook itself has a number of illustrations.  I wish all recipes had quality food photography with them, and this one has some, in fact more than most I have been looking at, but still falls well short of what I would like.  But the recipes are good, I feel inspired to get a lot more out of our air fryer, and as the meat eater in the family, I am a little jealous of a lot of the Keto options. All in all it is a good cookbook, and very good for our needs.",positive
"I think the American Girl books are great for elementary aged kids. This one takes place in the 1970's which is when I was growing up, many years ago. It covers some historical information about that time period. It deals with divorce, which was pretty new back then as well as women's rights. I liked the story and found it engaging as well as entertaining.",positive
"I ordered this book many years ago and reviewed it then. However, Vine tells me that I did not review it.  I am sure it was a perfectly acceptable YA book for teen girls, but to be honest, I cannot remember it.",positive
"If I could give this novel a 0, I would. It was not that the subject matter was not interesting (we have all read E. Lynn Harris), but it was disjointed and frankly not well written.  King spent most of his novel preaching about ""coming out because of all of the heterosexual women at risk"" and yet in his own sexual encounters, never mention taking precautions to protect himself, his lovers, or their spouses/other lovers. I found that he was a hypocrite and insincere.  If you want to talk the talk, walk the walk.<br /><br />Kings writing style also crippled the novel. He jumps from event to event, sexual encounter (his own and others) to sexual counters, preaches about God, coming out and the truth, while not really telling a clearly written and coherent story. At least E. Lynn Harris gives you a story, although it may lack finese, but it flows. Perhaps if King was not so arrogant he could tell a story that would mean something to the readers. He could have really given the public some real knowledge on the subject, while making you sympathize with him and others like him.<br /><br />If you are just compelled to read it, get it from a friend or the library....I definately wouldn't spend money on it.",negative

"It has taken me over three weeks to read this very large guide. The text covers many topics in an easy-to-read format that every employee should be aware of with regard to their rights in the workplace.  The topics range from OSHA rules, tobacco smoke in the workplace, 401K and pension plans, privacy rights, pregnancy discrimination, medical insurance and COBRA, whistleblower laws, etc., etc.<br /><br />There are some interesting case studies that the author uses to make a point.  For instance in one case study a company denied workers the use of toilet facilities.  Although the employer was following the letter of the law (providing enough facilities but not letting them use it) OSHA's official ruling on the matter stated ""Toilets that employees are not allowed to use for extended periods cannot be said to be 'available' to those employees.""<br /><br />The author also provides a list of laws by topic for each state (where applicable) which you can research further.<br /><br />One thing I felt lacking in the book is an explanation of whether employees have different rights depending on living in one state and working in another.  I assume the law associated with the state they work in applies, but I am wondering if there are exceptions to this.<br /><br />Overall, this guide is good for someone who is unfamiliar with their employee rights.  Many of the items covered will be familiar to those who have been in the workforce a while and, except for some nuances of the law, this book will offer just a little bit more knowledge. What I've learned more than anything else is that in many cases you'll need to get a lawyer to protect your rights.",positive

"BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS: A NOVEL is a literary mystery/thriller, which is a genre that I generally don't care for.  However, the novel does a superb job of capturing the suffocating, claustrophobic, heat-infused atmosphere of a small Greek island (Hydra) during the summertime.  In a way, the island itself can be blamed for the ill-conceived burglary scheme that goes horribly wrong, and that produces disastrous consequences for the main characters (Naomi, Samantha, Faoud).  It is the stultifying island that nurtures the seed of rebellious Naomi’s dislike of her family's lifestyle, and that allows the seed to grow, flourish, and bloom.<br /><br />The story is told almost entirely from the viewpoints of Naomi, Samantha, and Faoud.  The three are thrown together by Fate--and confined on a self-contained island that is populated by tourists, wealthy expatriates, and year-round native residents.  The events would never have occurred but for the two young women’s chance meeting, their friendship born at least in part from shared boredom, and the continuing presence of the blazing, blinding Greek sun that can affect people's thought processes.<br /><br />The story is slow-moving, especially in the first third of the book that mainly paints a beautiful picture of Hydra during the summer tourist months.  However, the plot picks up speed once the burglary scheme is hatched.  Ultimately the novel succeeds at drawing the reader into the events, and in making the burglary plot seem almost reasonable--perhaps even inevitable--given the island’s limited options for entertainment and its smothering atmosphere.",positive

high quality - good clear lines,positive
"There are a few good sections in this book (mainly the chapters that deal with WebLogic and the appendices of primers and reference material that comprise Section 6).  However, considering that this book weighs in at over 1000 pages, its mainly fluff or glib (but not helpful), with too much material that states the obvious.<br />Much of the fluff is found in Section 1 (The E-Commerce Landscape), and Section 2 (Architecting Java-Based E-Commerce Systems) was, in my opinion, a glossed over, high-level overview that was used as filler.<br />Sections 3 (B2C E-Commerce Solutions) and 4 (B2B E-Commerce Solutions) have a few interesting chapters in each.  My main complaint here is that Section 3 is a mix of solutions and techniques, while Section 4 is purely solution-focused.  Section 5 (M-Commerce) is too light to be useful, and most of the material is already woefully out of date.<br />My recommendation is to pass this book up and, instead, seek out single-topic books that address the subjects in which you're interested.",negative

"I have all of the PW cookbooks and pre-ordered this one as soon as I knew it was being written.  I love watching Ree and think she is great, however this book was disappointing to me.  I spent time looking through the book and it took a while before I found a recipe I'd even want to try.  Like others have mentioned, there's a lot of basic stuff here and it felt like I could find many of these types of recipes with an easy online search.  And I'm probably unlike most here when I say that I think I'm over seeing 12 or 15 photos of each recipe.  I literally have thousands of cookbooks and I LOVE photos, but I'm sorry I really don't need a photo of each ingredient being added to a mixer or pan.  It seems distracting to the recipe instructions in this book.  Photos of tricky instructions are great, but the mundane, unnecessary photos are bothering me LOL.  I'm keeping the book but disappointed with it.  If I had seen it first in a store I would not have purchased it.  Sorry Ree, this one missed the mark.<br /><br />Edited to add that I've decided to return this book.  After going through it again I realize I will never use it.",negative
Most prominent thing on the cover of this book is the names of the 2 best selling authors.  Despite this the book is simply a collection of admittedly cute  Illustrations of children.

"This is a great mystery set in the south.The characters are fun but what I really loved was the side comments..like,&#34;recent escapee from the state ...wacky shack&#34; and when Melanie thinks about her hunky boss Jack, it's described as &#34;whenever that man comes around,it was like someone struck a match in my pants &#34; !!! How can you not have a lot of laughs reading this? There are quite a few suspects in this mystery and each character has their place in the story. The setting is in an old southern mansion with lots of secret passageways in the walls. Each chapter brings you into a new aspect of the mystery. The authors did a very nice job with describing the settings in this story so well that you can almost feel the heat and humidity of the deep south. I definitely recommend this book to everyone who loves a great mystery with wonderful characters.",positive
"This is most definitely the worst mystery novel I have ever read. The characters are not two-dimentional--but one-dimentional. You will not care about anyone. There is also too much padding of incidental material, and enough red herrings to stock a Shanghai fish market. Though the lead character is supposedly gay, there is only a token gay content. He might as well be a Buddist missionary. The hero and his lover share only a Jewish ceremonial meal, all other forms of intimacy in their relationship seems to have vanished. We read mystery novels to get pleasure in discovering who dunnit before the detectives. It is impossilbe to do this when essential information is not revealed to the reader until after the culprit is caught. I feel I have wasted my time here. With an eternity of reading ahead of you, the time would still be too short to bother with this one. Read Wharton's Ethan Frome instead.",negative
"NOT the cutest lift the flap book.  Under the flaps in two of the five sections are simply written words (like &#34;Yellow&#34;  or &#34;octagon&#34;) not actual pictures.

However, stories are not that deep or sensitive, like in ""Unwomanly Face."" I was crying when I was reading the first book. Reading this book, I was waiting for when I will finish it. There are some very emotional stories (about Leningrad), but the rest are not. I would say that about one out of five novels has a profound impact and shock. Maybe if I were reading this book first, I would give it five stars, but not after reading it after ""Unwomanly Face of War.""",negative

"But I found a new must read author. The first 100 pages where a breathless read, I simply could not put the book down the writing was so compelling. However by the end of the book I felt used.

She lives in a cave accessible only at low tide. During the day, she offers massages to tourists, battling her hunger one or two euros at a time. Her pressing physical needs provide a deeper relief, obliterating her memories of unspeakable violence. But slowly, the specters of her former life resurface: her adoring younger sister; her unshakably proper mother; her father, who believed in his president; her journalist lover, who knew that Taylor would be overthrown. Now Jacqueline must face the ghosts that haunt her--or tip into full-blown madness. Hypnotic in its depiction of physical and spiritual hungers, this is a novel about ruin, faith, and the devastating memories can destroy and redeem us."" ~ from the author's homepage",negative

"I was really disappointed in this book. I had read the first series by this author, which was excellent. complex yet flowing and full of color.  The first book of this series was ok, although it had a very dark element the first series did not . And some brutal way too graphic violence.  But still it had an interesting plot and characters. But this book was bogged down from beginning to end. A very dark heavy tone, again ,way too much graphic violence , and characters with names that got confusing. (the violence was unexpected, given that it was not at all part of the author's tone in her earlier books). The bones of a good story were there, but it just was not executed like the other books.  I did not enjoy it, and only finished it, hoping it would start getting better.  It did get somewhat more interesting right towards the end, but did not make up for the rest of the book. I rarely throw a book away, but i would not read this again, and i wouldn't give it to the library, because i wouldn't want someone else to come across that violence unexpectedly.",negative

I bought this recently and have tried several times to sit down and read it and just cannot get through more than a few pages of it here and there. The book rambles and is not at all enjoyable to read; I found it tiresome and boring. The recipes in the back are probably the only reason I'll keep the book. I know Charlie Papazian is revered in the homebrewing world so I really WANT to like this book. I'd have a look at the book in your local bookstore and judge for yourself before buying.,negative
"This American Girl kit is really cute! It has a book with craft ideas along with some paper/sticker activities. It also comes with a nice doll sized canteen. There are crafts for skiing, fishing, geo-caching, and other outdoor activities.

The kit states that some adult assistance is required, but that will depend on the age of the reader.",positive
"This is the second book in the &#34;For Your Love&#34; series. The book starts out slowly, but picks up in the second half. The story line is sweet, but there's an over use of the &#34;F&#34; word in my opinion. I think the word could have been used a lot less without changing the bad girl/bad boy image. There's a lot of explicit sex. I liked the characters, but I did feel that Emma and Sean were an awkward couple. I loved the birthday cakes and the meaning behind that. I do like the O'Malley family dynamics. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.",positive

Twenty words were required I wouldn't ever pay for a book like this one because reading about crochet without knowing how to read patterns or reading of this very subject the way the minimally did here isn't nearly enough information nor was this good information . Pictures are always the most helpful and for some reason beginners love books with pictures and ones that are full of colors. That's why shoppers pay more to shop at target vs Walmart even though they know they'd save money going to Walmart. Colors make everything interest and worth more than a glance in a book show one pattern with viberant colors and I guarantee you 175% more in sales and satisfied customers,negative

"The author is an army linguist who was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In this text, she elaborates on what got her there, her rape, how it was handled, and what it was like to be a woman in a man's world. In one sense, she had to become more masculine during the war by evolving into someone she did not recognize. <br /><br />Those who have been traumatized via violence, whether it be rape or war, will most likely be able to relate to this story and the turmoil it brings to one's life. Those who never have received justice when justice was due may also relate.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the book I did not want to put down but the last third takes the reader on a wild trip of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) that made me feel like I caught a case of it. The author is a gifted writer and draws the reader into the story for most of this book with the exception of the last several chapters.",positive
"Going to Rome later this month and needed a guide book for my visit. I had signed up for several tours which were meeting at obscure tourist points. I had googled the internet to try to find where these places were and was only able to find one of them. I had figured that I would need to get to Rome and ask someone in the hotel (in my very broken Italian) where it was that I needed to go. In comes the Lonely Planet guide to Rome. First thing I did was go to find the locations I couldn't find anywhere else. As it turns out, the meet-up places I had been looking for were actual 'local aliases' that if you were a Rome resident you would know. The Lonely Planet guide had these listed both ways and I was not only able to read about the locales, but also locate them on the enclosed street maps. Kudos to Lonely Planet and their terrific tourist guides. I had used them before in Paris and Ireland, but never had needed them like I did this time. And forgetting all this personal information I needed, rest assured there is plenty of other tourist info like entry times and fees for tourist sites and reviews on restaurants as well.

After another hundred pages, nothing had changed. I knew where, who, and when, just not what. And I really wanted to know what had happened. After another hundred pages, same as before, except that I no longer cared what had happened. And when the pictures came off the wall and started dancing. I decided to call it a day.

"A thrilling, post-apocalyptic debut by author Tyrell Johnson, The Wolves of Winter will have you on the edge of your seat. The story is very believable and could conceivably happen if there was a disease epidemic on the scale of the black plague. We already have to corrupt Government and the ever-threatening loom of war that could tip the world as we know it into perpetual darkness. I grew up on post-apocalyptic stuff and up until this book I haven’t really enjoyed the way most authors have taken it by adding loads of flesh-eating zombies. This book was a breath of fresh air to liven up this overdone genre.<br /><br />The main character (and our narrator) Lynn, is a real (and at times flawed), strong female lead that women (and men) will look up to and want to be, she basically makes Katniss Everdene look like a wet lettuce. Lynn is a sharp, perceptive young woman who has led a sheltered life after leaving the states with her family but by the end of the book she could give any survival expert a run for their money. She is so well written you feel like you know her, in-fact all the characters make you feel like that.

"This planner is so close to perfect. I am a planner nerd. I loves all things planner related. For the price, this one is awesome. It has half of 2018 and all of 2019. I do prefer a standard year to an academic year, but I am happy they put the entirety of 2019 in. Each month has a monthly page that opens perfectly with the tab. On the “front” of the month, there is a habit tracker page. Then you have your weekly pages. My complaints are about the weekly pages. They begin the weeks with Monday. I hate that. On the monthly layout, they begin on Sunday, then the weeklies, they begin on Monday. Next, the weeks have an inconsistent layout. They added some variety in the “notes” section. So sometimes you have lined note space. Sometimes blank note space. Sometimes quotes or “assignments “. I wish it was consistent. And I wish it was just lined note space. I also love that they didn’t duplicate days within the week spread. Whatever month the majority of the week falls in, it is inside that month’s tab. The paper is nice quality. I could have done without the excessive quotes. But overall, a really impressive planner.",positive
"I was lucky to get a free copy of this book and my review is voluntary and honest.This is book 3 in the series. Each book is better than the one before it. In this one there are so many plot twists and &#34;OMG&#34; moments. This is defiantly one that you will not be able to put down, so make sure you have plenty of reading time available. This author really knows how to get your blood pumping. The characters all have such different personalities which really make this a great story. the story line where Zanders mother needs a kidney transplant..and gets something &#34;extra&#34; is one of my favorite parts in the book...such a clever way to write this by a very talented writer ! another great one for K.M.

"I am appalled by this book and by the author's stance towards the children he taught. This is a book filled with his own failure, which he turns into loathing of poor black and brown kids. Most teachers have been in a tough position at some point. And the good ones find a way to master their own sense of balance, their craft, and to structure a class and day that inspires kids to do better. The portraits he paints of his students are caricatures of the ugliest kind. Worst, he fails to realize that fear and loathing will never bring kids around- only love will. Even more enraging, he uses his time with them to make more money.",negative
"One of the best books I have read in a long time. The summary accurately depicts the story but there is still so much more. The journey that Chase takes to belong and remain in this alternate universe is so detailed and honest. This is not the usual fantasy book and neither is it science fiction, it's truly a well-written and amazing book.<br />No descriptive intimate scenes, no overly graphic violence. There is quite a bit of spears in the head but it flows well.<br />Good character growth, loveable characters and a believable plot.  A worthy read.",positive

"If you want to read a book about sexual escapades, this is the book for you.  If you prefer a little plot with your books, pass on this one.  Had this been the first Laurell Hamilton book that I had read, I would never have picked up another.  The early Anita Blake books were excellent, however I think the writer has begun to believe that all we readers want are sex fantasies.  That has made up more and more of her latest books. The action was always the best part, there really was none in this.  This one was just pure trash.",negative
"I generally like the Kenyon books, they are USUALLY entertaining, easy to read and good. But this one just wasn't. I was really disappointed! I started the book several months ago, and put it down. That is so unlike me, and if you check out the reviews that I have made recently, you will see that I read SEVERAL books (LA Banks, Feehan, Nora Roberts, Charlie Huston, JD Robb, and countless others) in the time that I put it away, but I was determined to finish it, and finish it I finally did. The book really had everything that should have worked for a paranormal romance novel, a sexy dream God(Arik), a lonely but beautiful, intelligent PHD, heroine (Megeara ""Geary"" Kafieri), several other demigods/GODS who caused trouble (Hades, Kat, and countless others) and a story that many people would find interesting (the search for Atlantis), but what the story lacked was good character development and a plot. There were chunks of story that were boring and frankly stupid....we all knew what the ending would be, it just took too long to get there. There were also several hints that the main character or her teammates were not what they seem, but they never really explain what her dreams or ability to influence dreams really meant. Maybe this would have been better as a SHORT story, I am not sure. I know that I just find it difficult to get excited about reading another Kenyon novel. I have already purchased Dark Side of the Moon, and hope that I have not wasted my money. So although I am a Kenyon fan, I would not suggest reading this one! Trust me, all of the reviewers aren't wrong. And while I love to support, some things you have to well frankly believe others.",negative

"If I could give no stars I would. I have not read this nor would I ever. If you have read any news of late, then you know that people have been calling the police on people of color for doing the most basic things: swimming, cooking outside, breathing! Well this author is no different. He, a supposed man of God, kicked a black family out of his church (though I’m sure he doesn’t own it) while they were having a funeral for their deceased loved one! The crime? Accidentally knocking over a chalice. Not on purpose, not in malice, by accident! So he cruelly kicked them out, but then to add the racist cherry on top, called the police. Why anyone would purchase a book about faith, compassion or understanding from this “priest” is beyond me. I know I won’t be and I hope you will not either!",negative

Also, the art wasn't that great either.",negative
"This second cookery book from London-based Comptoir Libanais focuses on speedy, healthful veggie-friendly dishes like a spiced mushroom and pine nut omelette, a hot halloumi pilaf with broad beans, peas, and herbs, vegetarian Comptoir lasagna made with chili, yogurt, feta and tahini, za'atar and chili devilled eggs, saffron, butternut, and red pepper pilaf, and lemon-marinated halloumi in pita. Carnivores are also amply represented; whether a mixed grill, skewered lamb and pepper wrap, grilled fish, burger, or fried chicken, you're sure to find something that delights. Desserts include a rose tea-infused compote, pistachio and almond cake, and baklava-style nut pastries.The graphic layout is particularly impressive and fun to cook from; you'll find loads of ingredient-specific tips and tricks. And a large cocktail and drink section doesn't hurt; spiced pomegranate and yogurt smoothie or Lebanese spiced hot chocolate, anyone? (Note: this is the original UK (metric) edition)",positive

"Book 2 in this series was extremely good, and temped me into trying the next story.  Sadly, the same narrative style Ben White used in book 2 became a huge liability in book 3 and soon turned a fun and interesting narrative into a complete disaster.<br /><br />Ben White tries to start this tale with Charlotte having lost her memory, but having a need to keep up her journal as she struggles to escape from a situation she understands is a major problem.<br /><br />The problem is that since Charlotte has no memory and even less of an idea of what is going on, the chapters contain even more teen angst than I found in book 1, and the problems are made worse by a complete lack of character interaction.  Charlotte appears to spend half of this tale whining about not knowing what's going on only to spend the rest of the tale being manipulated into hurting herself and her family.<br /><br />Frankly I hated this book.  Charlotte was turned from a dynamic and interesting (if angsty) young girl into a near robot who wrote because she felt she had to.<br /><br />The plot itself seemed equally uninspired, and by the end I found that I just wasn't interested in what was happening.  The lack of information and the fact that Charlotte had been almost completely wiped away as a character left this story with too little.<br /><br />I'm sure many will enjoy this story, I just don't count as one of those who do.",negative
"I read this book some time ago, but remember it as a well written, tight and interesting book that deals with a very sensitive subject in an eye-opening way.  To ramp up the drama, the book is set in rural america. It's a very good read, but if you like your books light and fluffy, this book isn't for you.  Also, if you hold very conservative political views, be warmed this may challenge your beliefs!",positive
"I really tried to like this book. I wanted to, but honestly, after getting more than half way through it, I still wasn't impressed, nor compelled to keep reading. I finished it, but it felt like a chore rather than a joy.<br /><br />The writing isn't bad and the premise is interesting, but I couldn't get past everyone being referred to by a nickname. It got confusing really quick and since I couldn't feel close to the characters, I really didn't care what happened to them.<br /><br />I guess this one just wasn't for me. You should still check it out though, as it might be just the thing for you.<br /><br />This review is based on a galley copy from netgalley, courtesy of the publisher.

"I have read numerous other Jen Lancaster books and find them fun and funny.  I thought this was going to be a nice treat for a Friday off work, but I was wrong.  I am halfway through the book and I'm pretty bored.  I am debating on wether or not to even bother finishing it.  There is no spark, no lightness in this book.  It all feels forced and hastily written.  I have yet to laugh out loud, like I do at every other book she's written.  Mostly there's just a lot of groaning in my head over bad jokes and thinly veiled references to her own life.  Please Jen, no more fiction!",negative
"Melody Gardot's impressive jazz debut Worrisome Heart channels the retro piano jazz of Diana Krall and Holly Cole while remaining uniquely original. I loved the album, but wasn't sure how the sheet music would translate.<br /><br />Published by Alfred Music, Worrisome Heart features nine of the ten album tracks (the album closer Goodnite was more of a sonic unwinding than a song) in the same sequence, beginning with Worrisome Heart. The song translates well to a piano-only medium, retaining its bluesy vibe (the piano picks up the bass part along with the piano melody). The acoustic guitar melody of All That I Need Is Love translates to the right-hand melody, while the Norah Jonesesque acoustic guitar of Sweet Memory is again picked up by the piano to impressive effect. The chilling cascade of notes opening Love Me Like A River Does is preserved, closing with the playful Goodnite. The left hand has some tricky rhythmic sections that mark time, so you may have to resort to a metronome to capture the exact timing that gives the songs their jazzy flavor.<br /><br />Overall, the piano transcription retains all the original character of the recorded tracks, with the right hand picking up the various melody lines of the acoustic guitar. The piano-only versions are impressively complete (complete with clearly marked tempos and bluesy grace notes) and blissfully easy to master (I would rate this as intermediate). Lyrics and guitar tabs are also included (there are also violin and other solos marked on several songs). There's not a lot of artwork other than some black-and-white photos of Melody in the endpieces, putting the focus squarely on the music.",positive

"This is very basic and takes too long to make any real progress.  More problematic is the Spanish is so rigid it comes close to incorrect.  For example, the constant use of ""Yo"" in front of the first person verbs.  This is not the way Spanish people speak.  Using ""Yo"" is for emphasis, and is not used generally... it is assumed by the use of the verb.  So if I want to say ""I speak Spanish,"" I would say ""Hablo español"" and not ""Yo hablo español.""",negative

"This book starts slowly, but gains speed to the point where it's hard to put down. My daughter and I both read this, so this includes thoughts from both of us. One thing that I found interesting, is that different things were revealed as the book moved along and it answered questions that I didn't know that I had. The love story wasn't satisfying in the sense that I didn't care for the boyfriend and preferred another guy in the story over him. As a parent, it was a little off putting that the characters were smokers. There's also some sexual content. The sex wasn't just a reference or a quick glossing over, but longer than I expected. It's not explicit though. My daughter says that she wouldn't recommend it to anyone under high school to read it. The details about free diving were interesting and my daughter want's to try it now. We both liked it and found it entertaining.",positive

"This piece of historical fiction is very engaging! It takes a difficult subject matter and presents it in an interesting, yet honest story. The story goes back and forth between two different times, but it wasn't too difficult to follow. I was initially turned off because of it being a YA book, but I'm so glad I kept at it!

This book is great, though, with pictures and maps and is great for a first time visitor to France. As expected, a lot of the book is dedicated to the Paris area.

"I used Cantarino's ""Civilización y cultura de España"" for some of my classes in Burgos, Spain, and found it to be an excellent supplement to the material that we were studying in class (from prehistory and Atapuerca to post-Franco democratic Spain). Each chapter covers a specific period in Spanish history, along with notes on art, architecture, music, literature for each time period. I found the level of Spanish to be very easy, although it might prove a bit challenging to second or third year Spanish students. The look of the book is a bit outdated (colour photos would have been nice for the art photos!), and the ""history"" ends at 1996 or so. Overall, a worthy investment, complete with maps, a timeline, a glossary, and plenty of useful, compact information about the most important events and people in Spain throughout the ages.",positive
"I live in Georgia and found this guide book to be okay, but not comprehensive. For it's size, there's no way it could include everything, especially since it covers 3 states. The book is a good size, but the paper is thin and not very sturdy. Guidebooks used to have heavier, glossy paper, but this does not. The information it provides is good, but there's so much more that's not included in it. For example, Savannah is one of my favorite places to go and two of my favorite restaurants, both of which have been there for years, aren't mentioned. I do like the idea of having just one book if I was traveling the three state area, but if you are just going to one state, I would suggest a more comprehensive guide book.",positive

"THE RISE OF ATHENS:  THE STORY OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST CIVILIZATION is &#34;narrative history&#34; that attempts to relate the story of Athens as it was experienced by the ancient Athenians who lived through the actual events described in the book. Because Athenians believed that the stories told about Theseus and about the events of the Odyssey and Iliad were actually true, author Anthony Everitt's narrative incorporates these fictional accounts into this &#34;history&#34;, right along with the more factual accounts of important events in Athens' history that were described by ancient historians.<br /><br />The book is extremely readable, but it's &#34;dumbed down&#34; history that cannot be relied on by any serious student of the history of Athens.  Fact and fiction get hopelessly mixed up in a presentation like this.  I like this book for its entertainment value, as &#34;a rollicking good yarn&#34;, but not at all as a history book.  The ancient Athenians were fascinating people, so the book is worth reading for pleasure, or as a young person's introduction to Ancient Greece, but I can't see it as a serious work of history.",positive

"I was very high on this book at the start, however as I read, it fell more and more out of my favor. The historical stories and war time fiction were strong, but her characters are so weak, that I almost stopped reading it halfway through.  I ended up hating Bess and I doubt that was the author's intent.  Her selfishness is beyond belief for someone we are supposed to like, her sister's character is real enough but she is written out too soon and leaves us only with her spirit.  I would rather have read this book from the point of view of Tom. He seemed more real than any of the others.  The time period being what it was, the controlled environment of her childhood makes Bess's choices even harder to swallow.  I think she was supposed to be this headstrong girl with a mind of her own but she ended up seeming like a hurtful piece of selfishness.<br /><br />The under story, The struggle between nature as she is and nature harnessed for use was a wonderful storyline and again I was filled with disappointment over the lack of power to the story.  We are talking about Niagara Falls for pity's sake it should have some power to her words about the struggle to ""use"" it.  Fortunately I am done with the book and maybe the selfishness of Bess will be forgotten as well.",negative

"This is one of those items that no one really needs, but is just pure fun.  It's a great gift item for anyone who was a fan of Warhol or just anyone who does desk work.  I suppose there is a certain amount of usefulness in the set as well as the quirky fun aspect.  Who doesn't need a pencil sharpener, an eraser, a ruler, note pads and some stickers.  Everyone needs a banana bookmark and a cow head eraser!!!!  Not sure what I would use the sand timer for, but someone might have a use for it.  Kids might enjoy it too, but the box says not intended for children and says 14 years old and up.  What kid wouldn't love a cow head eraser or a banana bookmark?  And every kid loves stickers.  There are not a lot of stickers here though.  The sand timer might be only thing you wouldn't want to give them, as it is glass and could break and cause cuts.  The box itself that holds everything is a nice sturdy flip top box--nothing chintzy about it.  The box is worth keeping, unlike cheap boxes that fall apart quickly.  It is made of very heavy cardboard.  Just a great fun item to own or give as a fun gag gift.  There aren't many gag gifts as useful as this.",positive

"I have to admit that this was one of the darkest and most depressing novels that I have ever, in my entire life (well maybe ""The Warmest December"" and ""Sybil"" were as dark, just better written with better story lines)...anyway, this novel was so depressing...I think I said that already..that it was difficult to read and often you were so turned off by the writing style, the subject matter, the characters (obese mother, triffling/raping father, rape, incest, AIDS, Social Service Agencies, Broken foster/Social care system, etc) that you did not want to finish it. The only interesting thing that I found about the novel was that it was written in the voice of the victim, an uneducated teen (kind of reminded me of the Color Purple, although that was a better story). And as things progressed in her life, the writing did improve. The most redeeming thing about the novel is that you can see how people by nature, especially children are SURVIVORS and are shaped by their circumstances. One would learn that you can either deal and live, or simply give up and die. So no matter what I thought of the novel, Precious (symbolism in her name) was a survivor and made the best of her circumstances.

"Please note that my review is based on the ARC and I am not sure that the last few chapters were included as the dialogue ended abruptly and I was expected more stories to be told than the ones that were in the book.<br /><br />None-the-less, the novel is premised on a group of nine individuals who were unfortunate enough to be trapped in the basement of a building after an earth quake on the west coast, that much you were told.  To past the time and to take everyone's mind of the situation, each person had to tell a story of 'one amazing thing' that happened in their life.  The preamble into the novel was a little disconnected for me; but I loved the individual stories that were told in the ARC - very well expressed and I was emotional involved with the characters.  I only wished the preamble into the start of the novel was as eloquently written.  I am going to have to get the final and published copy to finish reading the rest of the stories - they were very well written with each of the characters in mind: teaching us a lot of life lessons where some characters only started their own healing once they told their story.  Each story that was told was realistic enough and life like enough for me to understand the life lesson.  the stories were beautiful.",positive

"STRANGE MUSIC: A PIP & FLINX ADVENTURE is my first “Pip & Flinx”, but it works fine as a standalone. It’s a treat for classic sci-fi fans who harbor a special liking for aliens.  Alan Dean Foster creates alien environments, races, and cultures economically with words, packing enormous amounts of vivid detail into each page of this entertaining novel.",positive
It follows the classic tale yet it has realistic children and realistically illustrated animals. There is a twist of course at the end because the dolphins get to leave the sleigh. We found it funny and entertaining.,positive
The story makes no sense is sort of disturbing the way it's been chunked to fit the format of Golden Books. I haven't seen the movie but all of the adults feel uncomfortable reading it verbatim.

"I'm so disappointed in this book. I thought it would make a great gift for another dog lover friend of mine, one who is always sending me cute dog cartoons. But I thought I would pick up a used copy for myself first so I could actually read them. Perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough for the New Yorker brand of humor. Most of the cartoons contained in this book do not resonate with me at all.  Perhaps I'm exceptionally slow, but some I don't even understand. I find very few of them at all funny. Some, seem to me, to be at the expense of dogs. I doubt if most of these are actually written and drawn by dog lovers; it feels more like insensitive people trying to appear witty. There is a fairly large variety in this book, so you might find something that you like. I found a couple. But overall, I found this collection extremely disappointing. I will not buy another copy for my friend, and do not recommend it. I was going to purchase the New Yorker book of cat cartoons, but am now rethinking that. Thumbs down on this book!",negative

"This recipe book is easy to follow: and when you are talking about just add ingredients into an instant pot - it is then an easy recipe even though if some recipes do detail a lot of ingredients.  The recipes cover both meat lovers and vegetarians , stews and soups, mexican meals, sides, and desserts.  We have loved how easy it was to gather a meal - and again, the only complexity is gathering all the ingredients.  Many of the dishes we tried were simply delicious and you can change up if you are gluten intolerant - we used non-gluten pasta and reduced cooking by 20%.<br />greta layout with one page recipe and one page color photo of finished dish.  if you are like me - you cook because of the finished photo!",positive
This guy is #uc!^g nuts! Ok here is the problem some lazy parents use tv as a babysitter. If you let your children watch a show and don't talk about it with them then what they do is your fault not the shows. That being said how do you have a plot with no conflict? You can't have the rangers in vite the monsters over for tea and cookies that would be really boaring. Implied sexual inuendo? I haven't seen that when I watched.

"Love the Dover scores, love the fact that I can view it on my iPad, BUT the pages are actually images embedded in the pages, with large margins, even when you change the settings to do one image per page. When you enlarge an image so you can read it, you can't turn the page, so you have to close the image, then turn the page, then zoom in on the next image, which is obviously useless when listening to a rehearsal or recording.<br /><br />Hopefully Dover will fix this issue, because it's wonderful to have scores on my iPad.",negative
"The first 50 pages are a waste if you know anything about mental health already. It is just basic info about health and wellness. The journalling comes in on pages 51-173. Then, 173-end is just note pages ""for my final reflections"".<br /><br />I had been under the impression that the whole book was as pages 51-173 are. I did not need the extra stuff--i could google ""tips for health and wellness"" and get the same results for free.<br /><br />The author often quotes herself among quotes from greats like the Buddah and Dali Lama and Einstein. It is laughable, and kinda pompous. The book is cheesy and kindergarten level to anyone who has taken any class involving mental health before.<br /><br />Overall i am disappointed. Does not seem like it is worth $15.99.",negative

"This is a novel that shows alternate choices made over and over again, to show the different outcomes.  Centered around our main female character, she meets a boy as she is out walking dogs in her neighborhood.  While there is quite a bit of information about her relationships (because there are those in the past and present), her relationship with her brother took front and center for me.  I get that she has romantic angst, but compared with her family issues, it felt shallow to follow her feelings about the different guys in her life (or that she wanted in her life).<br /><br />Her younger brother suffers from drug addiction, so her relationship with her brother is explored and built on.  I really liked this story line, and like many Americans, have dealt with this issue in my own family, so it felt timely and personal.  I appreciated the nuance of that relationship and would have liked more with her family.<br /><br />Although I didn't care for the book overall, I think there is a younger audience who might really understand her angst over her love life.",negative

"This is the first book for this author. I think she wrote a great book with a fun storyline. This is a fast and easy read and I enjoyed the main character, Sam. She was very vulnerable in the beginning, but developed confidence in her search for the killer in the story. There are some yummy recipes at the end that are from that chapter. The only issue I had with this book was that I thought in some areas there was too much unneeded details. This is not a bad writing issue,it is just my opinion. All this said, the author did well on her first book.",positive
"In reality this is kind of an inane book, but it is visually stunning and brings back lots of memories, good and bad, about the franchise.  From remembering what it was like in 1977 watching New Hope for the first time to wincing through anything Annikan related.  It was a walk through the last 40+ years for me, and as long as a fan keeps their expectations in line, I think anyone can enjoy flipping through this book.  Perhaps the lists are meant to start a little debate and a little hard core fact checking.  It's a fun book for the Star Wars fan.",positive
"This is an interesting introduction to coding. It's not going to teach you how to code. Instead it gives you a historical journey through the world of coding. I'm not a coder.

If you are an expert in the field, then this might not be the book for you, but for someone with very little prior knowledge, I enjoyed it.",positive
Great book.  Quick stories before bed!,positive
"I have a hard time placing my finger on why I disliked this book so much. I will try, but overall, I disliked it much more than I can even convey. So much of the book was just the author talking about herself. I felt like the first two chapters were spent with her trying to tell you why she is the expert, despite her not having much to say. When you finally get into the “meat” of the book, all the advice simply boils down to clean eating, with some Bible verses thrown in to make it a Christian approach and not the approach of most other diets on the market. There isn’t enough information in the book to consider it more than just a basic intro to clean eating, which you can probably get for free from bloggers if you just look up the term “clean eating”. There are some recipes in the book but none that are really revolutionary or even more than basic.<br />If you’re looking for this info, Trim Healthy Mama does a better job and has a more unique approach.",negative

"I tried this disc in 4 PC CD players, 1 progressive scan JVC DVD/CD player and a PS2. On the PC's you saw a graphics page with areas in yellow. Lower right section had two areas to click. One for a video of Ms. Gertrud Huber playing the Harry Lime Theme by Anton Karas. The other had web site links. The tracks would not play. The (20 tracks) would be visible as blocks in the PS2 screen, but each had to be selected and there was no play through. There was the addition of dialogue at the beginning of each track (following the film/music structure). As the CD would come up (on the PC) you would hear the Harry Lime Theme playing. Amazon replaced it with another disc that did the same thing, which helped me decide to get the movie (I would have preferred to have a vehicle for hearing the soundtracks that would work in a PC, or a CD player). I am not qualified (or sensitive enough) to 'rate' the movie. I will say if you have never seen it, rent it and fast forward (treat yourself) to the last 2 minutes (see [...] Play it back with no music, then with music. Play it back at different times and through different moods and you will appreciate one of the finest works of film in existence coupled with one of the finest pieces of music ever produced. No single 'scene' can show you the promises of the past and let you feel the horror of regret. A mystical view that soon reveals Anna walking toward the camera, through the tree lined road, passing Holly is a statement and genius unto itself. The Karas compositions are brilliant, but this one is an everyman's masterpiece. What a gift (of course see the film. It is after all - superb!).",negative

"Bess Crawford, a WWI army nursing sister, genuinely cares about people.  So when she returns home to London from the French warfront on Christmas leave, and finds a battered wife with a concussion in the doorway of her flat, Bess quite naturally agrees to accompany the injured woman to Sussex to ensure her safe return to her family.  After arriving in Sussex, Bess accidentally learns some dark family secrets, and her already delayed Christmas visit to her parents in Somerset is further delayed by the murder of a houseguest in Sussex.  Ultimately, Bess is charged with a virtually impossible task to accomplish upon her return to wartime France:  locating an orphaned French child who may be the love child of the army officer husband of the battered wife.<br /><br />A BITTER TRUTH is the third book in Charles Todd's ""Bess Crawford"" series.  The story unfolds in a leisurely fashion, the murders are civilized (without gory descriptive details), and the backdrop of WWI England is well drawn.  Author Charles Todd (a mother and son team) writes extremely well, and has a wonderful knowledge of the WWI period that is incorporated in all of the Todd mystery novels.  Even when the plots, like this one, are a little far-fetched, Todd holds the reader's interest and wraps everything up in a believable fashion.<br /><br />A BITTER TRUTH is a little bit lighter on the WWI historical detail than usual, so I was a little disappointed.  This novel works fine as a standalone, but I would still recommend that readers new to the series begin with the first ""Bess Crawford"" novel, [[ASIN:B003JTHR6O A Duty to the Dead]], in order to better understand Bess' situation and her particular family relationships with her mother, the Colonel Sahib, and Simon Brandon.",positive

None of the stories and characters were interesting. None of the stories build tension or create atmosphere. None of the stories are scary, multi-layered, or intriguing. Everything was a sore to look at and boring to read!<br /><br />It was a pain getting through this because it was so bad.

"Apologies to the author I tried for nearly two weeks and I just couldn't get into the story. Nothing grabbed me and made me want to find out more. I was told that even though this is part of a series it was readable as a stand-alone novel. Not knowing the back story though truly did hinder my understanding of who the characters were, why they acted the way they did, etc. The story jumped, repeatedly in the portion I was able to read, between a fantasy realm and a modern Earth setting and threw a lot of characters from previous story lines.<br />Some of the characters felt like cookie cutter fantasy novel characters. The humble and understanding hero type. The good guy who's gone angsty and is going to get the rest of the good guys. The older, wiser mentor of the good party. It's all been done to death.<br />I honestly found nothing here to recommend. Maybe if I'd read the previous books? But I was told this would work as a stand alone and it just didn't.<br />I received this book in exchange for my review.",negative

"Oddly strange little book that somehow manages to be quite moving on its own terms.  As much (maybe even more) about Todd Slaughter's somewhat magical life than his Elvis connections.  He writes of his childhood and beyond in clear-eyed, just the facts, ma'am fashion, and the Elvis stories he reveals serve to bring a different, less legendary Elvis to the forefront.  This very human Elvis is much put-upon, manipulated, and taken advantage of; not just by the usual (and genuine) villain, Colonel Tom Parker, but by just about all the suits he has to deal with (from RCA, MGM, music publishers, booking agents, etc.).  At times, even his father and members of the Memphis Mafia are suspect.  All told with compassion and a genuine sense of affection by Todd Slaughter.  Truly, it's a wonder that Elvis didn't flame out even sooner, going by Slaughter's recollections.  The usual self-published boondoggles (poor editing, etc.) apply.  Still, a good read all-in-all.",positive

"I ordered this with my friend's severely autistic son in mind. This very thin book introduces the concept of five love languages that can be used to ""love"" your spouse and your child or children with disabilities. <br /><br />The five languages are:<br />- Words of Affirmation<br />- Quality Time<br />- Gifts (or ""Receiving Gifts"")<br />- Acts of Service<br />- Pysical Touch<br /><br />Two helpful child development categories ( attachment and cognitive development) are also introduced because it is helpful to know where your child stands with regard to these categories. For children with unhealthy attachments, understanding their type of attachment helps the parent to implement these love languages to provide healing.<br /><br />These love languages are used between the parents and also between parent and child. For example with regard to physical touch, one father would rub the cheek of his child when in the NICU to provide physical contact and express love. When that disabled child began to talk, his son would beg to have his cheek rubbed as it would soothe him and let him know he felt loved.<br /><br />In summary, this is an resource for parents with disabled children. The entire premise of this text is to introduce these five love languages and then provide parents with examples of how others implemented them with their children and sometimes with each other. At the beginning there are tests the parent can take to determine their love language. Those tests are also available online.<br /><br />I believe this book is not only good for those who have disabled children but for any adult in a relationship or with a child. However, I did want more. I would have liked five full case studies on each of these love languages in addition to the many unrelated examples.",positive

"This hurts.  I've admired Dr. Longo's ingenuity, creativity and genius for a while now.  Loved one of his documentaries on FireStick...watched podcasts and interviews.  Loved each and every single one of them.<br /><br />Then I bought this book.  It all fell appart for me.  I'd have returned it if it wasn't because I had earmarked a few pages.<br /><br />First few parts of the book are mostly autobiographical.  Call me crazy but I was not that interested in that portion of the book.  I mean, he's lead a very rich life, I just don't want to pay to hear about it.  Tell me all about it over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, for free.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a huge sale on his Prolon FMD product.  Which is fine.

Also, there is another great documentary about fasting, etc. called The Science of Fasting.  Both are great.<br /><br />IF you are unable to fast for health or weight loss due to health issues or social issues or whatever, then sure, you can pay to get the FMD Prolon info from his book ...or...you could get it for free on his website.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone not waste their hard earned pesos.",negative

"I am angry. Angry that all these 5 star reviews couldn't possibly be about this book. I read the reviews and thought this would be a real page turner. The characters are so one dimensional that a reader couldn't possibly care about them one way or another. The title is misleading. It should have been 'Aubrey & the strangler'. The 'lineman' in this story is Gil and except for a brief excerpt from Glen Campbell's 'Wichita Lineman', you have no idea what Gil really does in his job. Not any insight into this lineman's life unless it is with Aubrey. It's all about Aubrey. As for the characters. they have no emotion, realism and depth. I have never been negative when it comes to writers, because I know how hard it is to be published (well, it used to be hard).<br />When reading a book, the reader should be taken inside of it, feeling what the characters feel. I could not have cared less about these characters. As for being a page turner, they turned whenever I dropped the book as I dozed off while waiting for the emotion, the thrill, the anything. The title totally deceived me and that angers me that I paid for this based on reviews.",negative
"This novel is certainly light reading and full of cliche phrases that made me laugh. I listened to it on Audible. It was actually fun to listen to when I was ill recently; it was a very good stress-reducer. I would hardly call it good writing. The characters are rather flat, corny, and silly. This is a book for teenagers, or possibly, young adults with limited experience of history or good writing. Obviously, Sarah Woodbury borrowed some ideas from the Outlander series, but she does not write nearly as well as Diana Gabaldon.<br /><br />Okay, I changed this from a one star to two stars, since it is rather fun. Young teens would like this book.",negative
"Disappointed. Started listening to an audio version of this in the car and after about a minute became so emotional I thought I had better not listen to it driving and bought the book.

I found it concise, colorful, chock full of information and containing loads of maps and visitor site information. I typically use Frommer's guides when I have gone to Europe in the past, so this was my first use of the Lonely Planet series. I would highly recommend the book for anyone traveling to the Emerald Isle as an alternative to what I feel can sometimes be the complexity of Frommers. I have also obtained the Lonely Planet guide to Italy which I have not, as of yet, been able to use. Hope to travel there in the late Fall time frame and will be reviewing that one as well upon my return. However, I am fully confident that the book will serve me as this one on Ireland did.",positive
"As a sci fi fan who cut his teeth on the flood of nuclear armageddon stories that flooded the sci fi world in the 1950s, I was very much looking forward to this book. Having read, watched, and listened to more end of the world tales than I can count, a new take on the apocalypse is always welcome. Sadly, Last Day was a total disappointment for me. One quarter of the way into the book, all I've encountered are damaged characters ranging from the unlikable to the forgettable, each of them as boring as their lives are. Nothing in the narrative drew me into the story or gave me any reason to keep reading. Instead, I was forcing myself to continue for the sake of this review. When I got to the part about a rich guy floating bubbles of mouse pee in a weightless space station because he had so much money he could get away with it, I threw in the towel. Perhaps this book eventually does something interesting with these folks. Personally I don't care enough about any of them to stick around any longer to see. Peace out.",negative
"But not much romance. Laura Matthews, wants to bear a child, she believes her hectic London lifestyle is the cause of her infertility. She and her husband, Dan the man, buy a cozy cottage far from the madding crowd, in Wales. Hubby heads to London for the week while she plans to pamper herself and paint. Rhys, the hunky neighbor with a issue of his own regales her with stories of Merlin, Megan the maid, and Lord Geraint.<br /><br />Not a lot of Merlin and Laura makes some decisions that are a romance killer.",negative
"All in all, this coloring book is okay. I wouldn't purchase another by this publisher again due to how thin the paper is and the blank border around the doodle images. There are much better books for close to the same price. The book has 17 pictures plus two &#34;bonus&#34; pictures from other editions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Interesting doodle pictures - I attached some examples<br />- Fun patterns that will be nice to color<br />- Pictures are single sided to help with bleed through<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Paper is crazy thin! Even though the pictures are single sided, using my markers it bled through to the next image (see attached). You definitely have to remove the page from the book if you are using markers.<br />- Another con, the pages aren't perforated - so removing them from the book cleanly will require some scissors, luck, or a xacto knife.  Not a big deal, but quite annoying.<br />- The pictures don't take up the whole page, there is a lot of border around even the &#34;full page&#34; images. I prefer the pages to reach all the way to the end.  It will be hard to get clean borders on the square images.",negative
"How refreshing to read a rock musician's autobiography that is exactly that -- his life story, his words, not 'as told to' or ghost-written.  Even more refreshing is the fact that Chris Hillman story teller is just like Chris Hillman singer / songwriter/ player -- low-key and straight ahead, no flash or fake fireworks.  I've been a fan since 1965 when I won a copy of The Byrds' Mr. Tambourine Man LP from NYC's WMCA Good Guys.  I have the complete Hillman discography in my collection (with a few compilation exceptions) and I've found something of value in all of them, even though there've been some missteps along the way.  Time Between recounts his family and musical life with warts and all honesty, and, perhaps even more importantly, he shares his spiritual journey and his road to contentment with the reader as well.  It's a fine ride, a journey worth taking, for sure, like a long talk with an old friend.  I'd have liked an index included for quick reference purposes, but that's a minor quibble.  Highly recommended.",positive
I am not the least satisfied with this book. I think the exercises in it are lame. I was hoping for several ideas to perform in the office over the next 12-18 months but honestly I cannot find ONE worthy of trying! I'm sorry to say that this book is a complete waste of money and time.,negative

"CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS: A NOVEL is written in economical prose--not the kind that Hemingway produced, but the dull, uninteresting kind. Even worse, the plot is all about slow-developing, slow-moving relationships among characters that are neither memorable nor compelling.  And of course, as a debut novel, it’s written with a first-person narrator.<br /><br />I ordered this book because of the Dublin setting (which hardly matters) and the advertised “best book” selections by Vogue, Slate, Elle, etc.  I have no idea why this novel would make anyone’s “best book” list, or why anyone would say that it doesn’t read like a debut novel.",negative

"I discovered Debbie Macomber through her [[ASIN:0373892136 Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove Cookbook]], which was in our small local library in Central Japan. After returning home from six months with no kitchen (and having spent the previous Christmas overseas), I was thrilled to see her Christmas cookbook, and made numerous dishes from it for my first Christmas back home with family and friends, including the three-cheese scalloped potatoes and numerous sweets (triple ginger chocolate chunk cookies, almond joy to the world, cappuccino snickerdoodles with mocha glaze). The only real miss was the scalloped potatoes, which turned out far too watery. The recipe calls for 3 cups whole milk but no flour or other thickener, and the starch from the potatoes wasn't enough to hold it together (the milk is simply heated before being poured over the potatoes and baked).<br /><br />The recipes include traditional favorites alongside international additions like Spanish tortilla, green pea hummus, Provencal tomatoes, and tzatziki dip, so you can mix and match influences if you so desire. Tucked between the recipes you'll find cute, easy decorating ideas and crafts. If you could wrap up the sights, smells, and tastes of everything wonderful about holiday season, it would look a lot like this! ""Debbie Macomber's Christmas"" would make a wonderful gift for family and friends, and it's also a great cookbook to cook from together as a family (some of the simpler recipes would be appropriate for young kitchen helpers).",positive

"I've read other books by Joel Selvin (his Rick Nelson biography is my favorite) and this one's right up there among his best.  Well-researched, written with wit and economy, Selvin takes a deep dive into the 1960s version of the popular myth of Cali that we all bought into back in the day.  Surf's up!  All aboard the tidal wave!  Lots to swim into here, and Selvin makes a fine tour guide: Jan & Dean, the Frank Sinatra Jr. kidnapping, Jan's near-fatal car accident, the emergence of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, Brian's tortured genius, California's rise as the center of America's recording industry, and on and on.  It may not all be new to you -- it wasn't to me, an avid reader of all things '60s pop culture -- but it will grab your attention and hold your interest throughout, as Selvin is a master storyteller.  Highly recommended.",positive

"This book was disappointing.  It plodded along like the mule in the story.  I felt like I was binge watching episodes of an old TV series that necessarily contained a drama in every episode.  No real climax.  No epiphany moment.  No twists or turns.  Just strung along until the next episode.  Boring and at the same time, really depressing.  Sad thing is, it had all the makings of being an inspirational story based on real history, but instead, the author turned it into a series of melodramatic, virtue signaling drama, which was overdone and completely lacking in inspiration and hope.  So many evil nasty people!  And all of them religious bigots.  Imagine that!  I have no difficulty reading about hard places and hard times, but if it isn't edifying or uplifting, what's the point of reading it, really.  I could find none.",negative
"How disappointing. I thought the first book had some possibilities for development into a good series. But this second book took a major step back in terms of quality.  It's basically a girl resists boy,  girl can't resist him any longer, girls has to tell him lies for his own good plot.  with a little sideline hastily dashed in about an evil sorcerer who hypnotizes people.  It's almost like this should have been a few chapters or something-not a whole book. The plot developed way too fast and not in a satisfying way. And i'm getting tired of a prince/now king who pretty much does nothing but stare soulfully with his beautiful blue eyes.",negative

"Frankly, I was disappointed with this book. I actually had to force myself to finish it, which is a very unusual situation for me. I have read every single other book about Kit several times, and enjoyed them all, mainly due to the fact that they were set in the Great Depression.  Well- written historical fiction is my favorite type of book to read. This book makes only one reference to the Depression, literally only one sentence. If I was not familiar with Kit's character already, I would not have known what the setting was, due to the lack of historical references. There is very little continuity between the events and characters in the former books and this one. Lastly, the concluding &#34;Peek Into the Past&#34; section, always present in the other Kit mystery books, has been reduced to two pages and no historical photographs. If this is what the content and format of the &#34;Beforever&#34; books is going to be like, I doubt seriously if I will buy any more.",negative

"This book was absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />firstly thank you to NetGalley.com and Black Rose Writing for giving me a copy of this book.<br /><br />I have always loved history and in particular, have developed a penchant for military history. This has drawn me many times to the American civil war, of which I have read so many books over the years I have lost count. However, this book stands out from all of them and will have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf forever.<br /><br />Where Eagles Dare Not Perch is a riveting read from start to finish. It does not sugar-coat the horrors of war with glory or honour but rather shows it for the hell on earth that it truly is; that it makes wraiths of even the strongest people, that it destroys lives, homes, communities, faith, and hope. Nobody escapes unscathed from war, be that physically, mentally or both. This is truly a study of the human condition as it follows three intensely dark journeys - the main characters own journey as a soldier returning to a brutal and hopeless war; his sweetheart’s journey as she seeks absolution; and the brother of a murdered man, whose quest for revenge propels him into the most violent of worlds. It is a story of lust, revenge, forgiveness, and acceptance. I cannot recommend it enough and will be reading more by this author for sure.",positive

"My top three favorite books of all time include Hannibal by Thomas Harris with the correct, original ending. I didn't love Hannibal Rising, but I was happy enough with it. So I was excited about Cari Mora enough to pre-order the Audible version. Sadly, I'm left disappointed and a little bored after listening to it.<br /><br />The first problem is the self narration by the author. This can be wonderful, but usually doesn't work out well and this is one of those times when a professional voice actor should have been hired. The flow is not as smooth as it could be and there are awkward pauses here and there.<br /><br />I was in no way expecting a recreation of Hannibal Lector or Clarice here. Yet there are faint, very watered down echoes of both characters - for example the weird use of ""okeydoke"" here. The story includes similarly graphic, violence and vile predilections from several lead characters as well as a grim backstory for Cari. Unfortunately, these all lack the deeply thought out, twisted nobility and underhanded charm of Lector or Clarice or even Inspector Patzi. Instead, Hans-Pedro and Cari feel like cheap imposters. There is no honor or even appreciation for anything in life within these characters. I just found the whole book felt like an after thought and slapped together - even the gold as the focus of the plot, never seemed important. There are no iconic lines from Cari Mora to wiggle into our lexicon either - Mr Harris left his wit on the editor's floor I'm afraid.",negative
This is the first book that I have read from the author. I can say I was truly hooked from the first chapter. This is one of those sit on the edge of your seat stories with so many twists !

"I would give this book 2 1/2 stars if I could. My biggest problem with the book was the poor writing. There was NO editing for this book. Unless someone's talking, all you have to do is skim and you'll get the idea of what's currently happening just fine. Don't bother reading every word.<br /><br />Most of the book is very repetitive and not very much happens. Blah.<br /><br />When someone is talking, the author uses &#34;you see&#34; waaaaayy too much, and often without a comma after it. She uses the word &#34;Ok&#34; instead of &#34;Okay&#34; or &#34;okay&#34; or even &#34;ok.&#34; No, it it's always &#34;Ok&#34; even in the middle of a sentence. Also uses &#34;of course&#34; too much, and &#34;anyways&#34; is not a word.<br /><br />ANYWAY, I liked the story well enough by the end of the book, but it's not really enough to keep me going so I probably will not buy the next book.

"Elena Maldonado has done something to get her savagely beaten, but the guy that ordered this didn't reckon with her father, Ray Cruz.  Cruz is a retired jack of all trades fixer for bad guys, extremely dangerous to anyone who hurts his family.  This is a violent, well plotted novel that would appeal to many people.  Because it was so well written and fast-paced, I read it in a sitting.  But it definitely is not for the faint of heart. Some people complain about the ending.  I think it fit the scenario well.  There are tons of gory murders, threats, near misses and resolution.  We know what Elena did, who was involved and what happened to them.  Sadly, one guy gets away with his bad behavior, but hey-- life isn't fair.  Do NOT read this if gory violence that is usually senseless is not your thing.  I don't mind it, but would not choose it.

"This is a well laid out book. There are plenty of pictures, even step by step pictures helping you wade through the unfamiliar territory. You'll need more than the average American kitchen contains, though. You'll need a meat grinder. For many recipes, you need a separate meat curing fridge. You'll need a sausage stuffer. None of these recipes will make your kitchen more efficient or save you money. This is more of a hobby cooking type endeavor. (Telling you his first few hams didn't turn out, so don't worry if yours doesn't won't fly when you're counting on that ham for dinner.)<br /><br />You should also be aware that this book, particularly in the introduction, is quite crude and contains a few profanities.

"This is a slightly quirky, dysfunctional family, mystery set in 1968 Laguna Beach California.  Matt Anthony is the strangely stable kid with a brother fighting in Vietnam, soon to come home, and an older sister Jazz who is still in high school.  At sixteen, he can drive his Mom's van but usually travels by bike to go fishing and precisely deliver papers for a little much needed cash.  His mother has a big drug problem, barely pays the rent waitressing in a pirate themed restaurant and is tuned out of her children's lives a lot of the time.  His father left long ago and contributes nothing.  He's politically right wing, very into guns and pretends in phone calls to his son that he's there for him, but he never is.  Matt and Jazz both do some work in an early version of a New Age bookstore and gallery.  This is the summer that his long time crush has a crush back at him but another girl, who attends meetings at the retreat occupying acres on a hill also catches his eye.  And along the way, Jazz disappears, the police say she's a runaway, odd factions in town seem to have unexpected connections, his mother moves the family to the part of town that is known for free living and drug use, and Matt's loyalties are all over the place, with one exception:  He knows his sister did not run away.  He knows she is being held somewhere against her will.  And he will do all he can to save her.  This is a cool pastiche of the era, with various points of view represented through  fairly quick sketches but sufficient and engrossing.  Matt is a great character.  Enjoyed.",positive

"THE WAND CHOOSES THE WIZARD (Harry Potter) is a rather silly interactive book that may amuse a child for a little while.  The book is battery-operated, and it comes with a battery-operated plastic wand.  (Fortunately, the appropriate disc batteries are included and already installed.)  The child needs to be old enough to know NOT to poke someone in the eye with the wand.<br /><br />When you read through the book, which summarizes the way that Harry Potter used his wand throughout the whole series of Potter books, you come to diagrams of various wand-assisted spells.  If you like, you can use the wand to perform the wand motion that accompanies the spell.  Then if you press the button on the wand and touch the wand to the diagram in the book, the book plays the spell (e.g., “Accio”) as pronounced by Harry in the Potter movies.<br /><br />The book isn’t very expensive (about $10.50 on Amazon), but a child will probably tire of it quickly.  A child who has read the Potter books won’t need the explanatory text in the book at all.  As an adult, I lost interest as soon as I realized that the spell recording would play whenever I touched the wand tip to a spell diagram and pressed the button--there is no need to actually wave the wand in the appropriate pattern to activate the recording.",negative

"Although dated (1971), Philip J. Klass's SECRET SENTRIES IN SPACE is a good introduction to U.S. (and Soviet) space reconnaissance systems. While I had heard about this book a few years back, what peaked my interest and led me to purchase it was the fact it is mentioned in a recently declassified (September 17, 2011) Top Secret National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) publication, A HISTORY OF THE HEXAGON PROGRAM (April 2012), available on Amazon.com. Of note is this paragraph:<br /><br />""One of the magazines continually publishing articles on the progress of this nation's reconnaissance programs is AVIATION WEEK [or AVIATION LEAK, as it's jokingly referred to it!] Other publications have sporadically covered this area of government activity, but the most prolific writer on the subject has been AVIATION WEEK'S Philip J. Klass. He did a thorough job in summarizing his knowledge of the United States reconnaissance program in a book titled 'Secret Sentries in Space'. Although lacking in some details, and slightly inaccurate in others, little is left to the imagination of our nation's adversaries. What is really damaging is the impact these public revelations have on people involved in reconnaissance programs. After each public announcement of the newest advances in this country's space reconnaissance activities it is necessary for program management in both government and industry to caution their personnel not to discuss or confirm these stories.""<br /><br />Enough said!",positive

"An eleven-year-old girl and her sisters are traumatized by a murder which takes place at a convenience store in their neighborhood. Maggie actually becomes very OCD after this incident The story is told from her viewpoint.  She begins to repeat things in her head twice, count things and has to have the number even, checks constantly for the robber. Maggie thinks he is literally everywhere and will &#34;shoot her in the head or heart, any minute.&#34;<br />Overall Reaction: This book is disturbing. The description on Amazon was better than the book turned out to be. Maggie is portrayed as a child that is experiencing serious mental health issues. Since it's written in first-person, her anxieties and rituals overwhelm the story. The character development was also lacking. Each character has one trait pointed out about them, and what is revealed is not flattering. For example, the author hints at the mom being fat, the dad has skinny arms and is short; little sister has a ponytail she nervously chews on. The older sister is  portrayed as being only a very moody teenager; even friends are not written about in detail. I would best say the writer's style is rather blank and empty. This book left me feeling anxious.<br />One More Thing: Usually minor swear words don't bother me too much, particularly in Y.A, fiction. However, the F-Word is a huge turn-off for me, in life as well as in literature. This book had a child saying F-Off several times. Even though abbreviated with a hyphen, I found this very inappropriate, especially since this supposedly geared toward younger readers.",negative

"Of course I knew I wouldn't become an iPhone developer in a day, but I hoped that I would get a good grounding from this book.  It didn't happen that way.  When I tried to work on the examples in the book I got errors and nothing worked.  I got frustrated and never went back to it.  Upon reading other reviews I see that there's a lot of typos & bad code which explains at least some of that.  A technical book like this has to be proofread to a higher standard.  No one wants to pay that much for a book then have to scribble 500 corrections into it.<br /><br />And of course, this version is now out of date.  Look for other options.",negative
"I had submitted an earlier review on this Author warning of an overly aggressive r-a-c-i-al undertone in this book, but it was rejected so I will stick with the facts of this book.

"What a disappointment!  The first-person narrator in THE SILENT PATIENT is a damaged, self-absorbed psychotherapist who should never have been allowed to treat patients.  He is not quite an ""unreliable narrator"", but is very, very close to one.  The much-admired plot twist is contrived and unbelievable.  The ending is a total letdown, and would be stronger, in my opinion, if the perp were allowed to get away with everything.  The writing is competent but plain.  This isn't really a mystery, and I regret wasting both time and money (Kindle $10.99) on it.",negative

"A very good, if one-sided read.  Would love to hear Jim (Roger) McGuinn's version of events.  Ms. McGuinn has triumphed over a lot of adversities, and comes across as a good and honest woman who was betrayed by her own naïve ways as well as by the rock 'n' roll lifestyle her then-husband embraced.  She found her strength though, rose above it, and raised her two sons as a single mom.  Inspirational in many ways.",positive
"PISTOLS AND PETTICOATS is kind of an odd duck--an historical survey of female detectives both real (e.g., Kate Warne of Pinkerton fame) and fictional (e.g., Dorothy Sayers' Harriet Vane; Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone), and of  female detective-story writers (e.g., Anna Katherine Green, the mother of detective fiction).  The survey is presented more or less in chronological order, so that factual biographies and fictional plot summaries are kind of jumbled together in the chapters.<br /><br />The text is thoroughly researched, and the catalog of female detectives seems complete--at least I couldn't think of a famous female detective (or female detective-story writer) who wasn't covered.  The text itself is very readable.  However, I quickly tired of reading plot summaries (especially when I'd read the novels already), and of working to separate the stories of the genuine female detectives from those of the detective-story authors and of the fictional detectives.<br /><br />To me, PISTOLS AND PETTICOATS seems like the end product of a lot of research that the author decided to publish so that the work wouldn't go to waste.  The book is footnoted, and has some great photographs of the real detectives and detective-fiction writers.  Overall it's a good job, and I think it could be used as a textbook in appropriate college courses (e.g., women's studies, contemporary culture, writing detective fiction).  Also, mystery fans interested in female detectives may be able to use it to find some detectives they've overlooked.  However, because PISTOLS AND PETTICOATS didn't contain any real revelations for me, I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",positive
"Readers who love sexy reads with a hero who makes your jaw drop with every smile and every word out of his mouth...who love strong, independent women who believe in true love and love fiercely will adore this book by Monica Murphy.<br /><br />Eleanor Murray is so tired of going out on awkward dates, blind dates and never connecting romantically with any of the men. She has always believed in true love and just wants to find her HEA. So when a close friend sets up a profile for her on a new dating app. She doesn’t want anything to do with it. But after promising to try it for thirty days, she connects with a guy that seems almost to good to be true.<br /><br />After years of playing the field Mitch Anderson is ready for something serious and real. He wants someone that will like him, not what he does. So when he meets Eleanor through a dating app he is pleasantly surprised. But Mitch is keeping a big secret from Eleanor.<br /><br />I loved Eleanor and Mitch getting to know one another. It was super fun and I immediately liked them. They were so adorable and flirty. But when these two meet in person they sizzle! So if you want a story that’s going to make you happy, that’s entertaining with a heaping amount of steam and filled with a generous topping of romance, this is it. Left me satisfied and smiling!",positive

"This book was recommended to me by my brother. I added it to my ever-growing “to be read” list and forgot about it for a few weeks. Then, as if the book desperately wanted to be read, every shop that I went into there it was staring me in the face. Finally, I came across a copy in a second-hand shop and figured I had to get it.<br /><br />This book grabs your attention from chapter one, or should I say, day one; seeing as the main protagonist Aiden will wake up each day as someone new. This got a bit confusing to start with and took me a while to get my head around the concept but by “day three” I was totally emersed and couldn’t put it down.<br /><br />The book opens with a dark and rainy night in a forest where you are thrown into the action and introduced to the narrator, a man with amnesia; lost and alone in the woods and one name on his lips…”Anna”. The only problem is that he doesn’t know who this Anna is, no matter how much he wracks his brain. His friend? His wife? His daughter?<br /><br />He glimpses a woman in a black dress, running for her life with a pursuer crashing through the foliage after her. He tries to chase after them but her cries for help are cut short but a gunshot that rings out in the darkness. He is too late. And so begins the incredibly original and unique “The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle”.<br /><br />This book is full of more twists and turns than an Agatha Cristie novel. This is author Stuart Turton’s debut novel as I cannot wait to see what else he has up his magical sleeves.",positive

"I think this book is strictly the set up a series. That would be fine except...nothing happens. There is a lot of yammering about why to prep for catastrophes, but no actual catastrophe happens.

"The parts that you are supposed to paint on are not fit for purpose, you will need to use some decent quality watercolor paper sheets to achieve the results in the examples.

"I purchased this book when it first came out.  I was initially pleased and made place mats by using one of the patterns. They came out well and I had no problems.  I recently completed a warp to make Serendipity, one of the more attractive patterns featured in the book. I reviewed the directions for threading but counting up the number of ends I would need and comparing the count with the pattern in the book I had a different count. I recounted several times and even tried several ways of adding things up but my end count remained the same. I assume that I misunderstood the sparse directions which were not clear.  It would have taken little effort to include clear instructions. I will not waste the warp, I will use for another project but it won't be from this book.",negative
"I almost put this book down after the first chapter for its rambling writing but eventually hung on for the whole ride. There really isn't any plot to this book, just the main character, Vivian and all of her thoughts and feelings past and present. She isn't very likable, she's destructive, she's mean and yet is also narcissistic and sleeps around. The last two chapters show she may turn herself around but I never cared to begin with. Author sounds like she shares some of these thoughts her character does, or turn it around and gives some dirty jabs to white women. The problems she describes belongs to all races and for her to separate it by black and white shows a lack knowledge and empathy for anyone other than the black race. I am not interested in reading anything else that she writes.",negative
"I found this book difficult to keep straight. There are several main characters and there's a lot of jumping around from character to character. The Muslim boy was my favorite character. He was the only character that was approachable, genuine and had good intentions. The whole story takes place over approximately one day, so it was slow moving. It requires a lot of descriptions to cover such a short time span, which the author does pretty well. The beginning of the school day, each character has a secret that doesn't get revealed until the end, so it appears that everyone is suspicious. The actual motives behind the bombing were a little unrealistic in my opinion, however, the topic is timely. Overall, it was interesting and entertaining.",positive

"This is the second book I have read in the Roy Grace series, and I honestly wish I has begun at the beginning.  So many of the characters have histories in previous books of the series, and knowing about each one would make reading this one a richer experience.  Still, I enjoyed this book very much and will gladly read more.<br /><br />In the current book, Roy Grace is given the duty of protecting a superstar singer and actress named Gaia in the usual locale, Brighton.  Gaia is in Brighton to shoot a movie in which she plays the mistress of King George IV, and she has been getting death threats.  In one attempt on her life, her assistant was murdered.  In an apparently unrelated event, a murder is committed at a chicken farm, and only the torso of the victim is found.  Are these related?  This is a mystery, so of course they are, though the reader is not let in on the secret for a long time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on a personal level, Roy's fiancee Cleo is pregnant, so he is trying to get his long-missing wife, Sandy, declared legally dead so he can marry Cleo.  Another woman comes to Brighton to look at the home Roy and Sandy shared.  She, too, has a child--is it Sandy's child with Roy?<br /><br />This book has a lot of twists and turns, and some questions are left unanswered.  It makes me want to read the next book, but in the meantime, I will read the previous ones in the series.  I enjoy Peter James as a writer and give this book four stars.",positive
"This book is an amazing collection of knowledge, use, and cultural history of the Native American flute. Its discussion of flute construction, fingering, scales, ornaments, and care and maintenance is excellent. The book expects the reader to have a basic grasp of musical notation and concepts.<br />An added bonus: eighteen of R. Carlos Nakai's tunes transcribed for flute. These are: December Snow, 12/13/82 song, Wioste Olowan Inkpa taya, Wioste Olowan Tokiya, 11/3/82 song, Death song, 11/11/82 song, Zuni song, 12/20/82 song, 12/13/82 no. 2 song, 11/20/82 song, Whippoorwill, Whirlwinds Dancing, Coventry Carol, Rainy Nights in Taos, Omaha song, The Colours Fall, and Crow Wing.<br />There is also an excellent chapter at the end of the book regarding R. Carlos Nakai's recordings and his influences. Ken Light, the maker of Amon Olorin flutes (R. Carlos Nakai plays an Amon Olorin Sonoran) also contributes. This is an indispensable guide to the Native American flute and is worth the cost.",positive

"The concept of easy 3-ingredient meals is good, but....<br /><br />If you're a picky eater like me, forget about it. I don't like onions, tomatoes, peppers, salmon....or many of the other things that take part in so many of the recipes in this book.

"A really easy flowing book that transitioned between two periods of history, located in a little hamlet in Provence, France.  One period covered the previous family that owned the farm, and the other period covered the lives of the people who had just bought the farm.  Both sets of families had dramas that you could genuinely see happen in the real world, so it was so believable the events and frictions that the author had bought out amongst the family members.  The novel kept you guessing on might have happened and all was revealed in its own time, yet there were mysteries left for the reader to conclude upon!  I really enjoyed the flow of the book and the events were not far fetched.  Well done on a first novel.",positive

"After a slow start, things picked up and it got to the point where I couldn't put this down. The story was original and new. A divorced couple go on a holiday vacation with their new romantic partners and their daughter. Early in the story, an accident is hinted at with the occasional foreshadowing in the form of police investigation interviews. I didn't really care for either of the men in this story, but the women were likeable. The daughter's imaginary friend grew tiresome and I was glad when that was resolved. It took me a couple of weeks to make my way through this because of the slow start, I just wasn't interested, But I'm glad I persevered and finished it because it was entertaining.",positive

"Reading the cover, one would think that it was about Kit Carson, and his role in the development of the west. You would be, like me, terribly wrong.<br /> This disappointing masters thesis is about everything other than Kit Carson  and the opening of the west. It's about Pres. Polks sly Manifest Destiny ruse, throwing Native Americans off their land, bullshitting Mexico into believing that they have ben beaten in the war, and unbelieveable amounts of ink and paper regarding some Navaho Chief, and his misadventures in the desert of the southwest.<br /> The author's failed attempt to awe his readers by using difficult language and big, but utterly useless words, shows him to be the sophmoric wannabe as opposed to someone who is supposed to have the ability to create cogent sentences.<br /> All in all, Sides missed the boat on this one. Try again, and try to stick to the outline.<br /> A waste of ink, paper, and money when so many other volumes exist that really address Sides missed points.",negative

The whole premise of the eccentric billionaire leaving behind a treasure hunt is pretty original. There were times where I couldn't put the book down, it was so exciting. There were a lot of descriptive paragraphs. I tend to gloss over things and then I discover that I've missed something and have to go back and reread. There is a ghostly presence in the book, but I didn't find it too supernatural or wacky. Overall, I did enjoy it!",positive
"This book is about an Instagram star who was raised in poverty in a religious cult environment. She did not have the upbringing that many of those who are successful have. As a result, she had to use her tenacity to succeed as an instagram star and find a way to build a house with her husband on what amounted to a shoestring budget. For instance, she used Instagram to partner with a door company and porcelain tile company to get their products for free and then feature them on her account. She had to get creative.<br /><br />In the next to last chapter she does provide some educational tidbits on how to use social media, but for the most part this book is purely inspirational. I absolutely loved it because it affirms how much a person can succeed if they have the tenacity to persevere and ignore all the naysayers and negative feedback. I do wish the book had more photos of the finished farmhouse in it. Other than this, it was a great read. Kudos to Noell Jett for her success both in her personal and professional life.",positive

"DROID COMPANION is a decent book, but it doesn't cover my Motorola Droid Razr (Model XT912).  Because the book is made up of screen shots with instructions that walk you through the use of specific buttons, it wasn't helpful to me.  For example, it discusses the  ""Menu"" button (with 4 squares) as an important navigational aid, but my phone doesn't have that button. (The equivalent, I think, is the permanent icon with the lines at the bottom left.)<br /><br />The Droid Razr is my first smartphone (okay, call me a Luddite), so I wanted a Droid phone manual that was pretty basic.  Mainly I wanted to know which buttons did what, so that I wouldn't run up unexpected charges or fail to use good features out of ignorance.  This book probably would have done most of what I wanted if Motorola hadn't completely revised the Droid display.  But the book teaches by taking you step-by-step through pressing buttons, so it's not a fast way to learn about your phone, even if your phone is covered.<br /><br />Because of the slow step-by-step method, I rate DROID COMPANION at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  Be sure to check your Droid model before ordering:  this book covers the Motorola Droid 3, Motorola Droid X2, HTC Droid Incredible 2, and the Samsung Droid Charge.",positive

"I was fond of the Choose Your Own Adventures when I was younger, so I was excited to give this a try. I have only tried a couple of variations so far, but they were both fun to read. The characters are very similar to literary heroes, such as Mr. Darcy and Jamie Fraser. The banter seems like it came right out of the classics, but just a tad racier. The story lines that I have read so far, were familiar, but I did enjoy having some control as to what directions it went. I found the wording of the choices given was humorous and witty. I do plan to read it again and try different routes.",positive
"Self-centered author, stupid story - really not worth the bother, and massively out dated as to the poseur techy references.",negative
"I really enjoyed this book and the only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I was really peeved that from the start (and this isn’t a spoiler as it says it pretty much right away) you are told that one of the main characters is going to die. And it’s not just a vague hint that it could be any one of them. No, the character in question is named outright. So I then spent the rest of the book waiting for the inevitable to happen which ruined it for me as if I hadn’t known exactly who was going to die it would have been a real plot twist and one that would have sky rocketed this book to way more than five stars.<br /><br />Anyway that little niggle aside the book itself was a cracking read and I loved it. The writing flowed and the characters were so engaging that I found myself flying though it and having a hard time putting it down. The ending wrapped up incredibly well and bought the whole story to a close whilst still leaving the reader wanting more. Plus there was a great reveal at the end which I won’t spoil. I’ll be ordering copies of D.O.G.S and F.O.X.E.S as soon as I’m done with this review as I really want to read more by M.A Bennett as I enjoyed her writing immensely.<br /><br />Overall S.T.A.G.S was a thrilling read and one that I will be recommending highly!",positive

"I used to read every Lincoln Rhyme novel and then got out of the habit.  That was a mistake.  ""The Midnight Lock"" is a very satisfactory entry to the series, with a clever, clever villain dubbed, ""The Locksmith,"" whose voyeuristic behavior terrifies women he has watched on the Internet; a blunder on Lincoln's part that gets a mobster off of a murder rap; a parting of ways between Lincoln and the NYPD; a conspiracy theory blogger called Verum; and the tie in of a famous scandal rag to the Locksmith's crimes.  Add in a few particularly dysfunctional families, several fires; a disgraced cop from Albany who is head of security for the scandal rag and there's plenty of fodder for the forensic criminalist and his team.  I'd forgotten what a master Deaver is at putting every clue WE need out there while weaving together multiple subplots through the primary case.

"I try to remain objective when reading. Some of the books I now love the most I didn't care for many years ago. Some of them start out slow or overly wordy or just don't appeal to me but they get better as they go on. This book, however, does not get any better. I almost think this book should be required to have a warning label that if you are expecting it to suddenly shine, you should perhaps get out your umbrella and brace for the messy rainstorm coming your way.<br /><br />My main problem with this novel, if one can call it that, is the word choices. This almost sounds like technical writing in places. The conversations are stiff and I never felt like I got to know the characters. By the half-way mark, I no longer cared what the characters were doing, or frankly, if they even survived. The writing never took me out of my reality and allowed me to settle into the story.<br /><br />Overall, I just found this entire book to be really disappointing, and though it pains me to say it, I do not feel it is worthy of a recommendation.<br /><br />This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review. All opinions are my own.",negative
"So disappointing to see such a fun series end on such a dull uninspired note.  If Ms. Flewelling was done with the series, as she indicates at the end of the book, she should have saved us all the price of this book, and written something else. Or maybe her contract necessitated this final installment. The saddest thing was that the two main characters could have been anyone--they had very little of the qualities or charm that had been developed in them over the past few books.whatever the case, for those of you reading this series for the first time, try some of the earlier ones--this is not indicative of the quality of the rest.",negative

"Bruce Feiler was one of the first JET English language teachers in Japan, and chronicles his experiences with his Japanese students, supervisors and colleagues with an observant eye towards Japanese society and culture. Bruce-san takes us along on his eye-opening hospital stay, on learning how to pick up Japanese girls at bars, on seasonal trips for fall viewings, skiing, and more.<br /><br />One obvious advantage in Bruce's camp was the fact that he already spoke Japanese and had previously lived in Japan, easing his transition. Although the portrait of Japanese society is somewhat dated (late '80s, much has transpired since then with the Japanese economy), his portrayal of a country at odds with its unique culture versus globalization, of the schools serving as parents and educators combined, and of the group, rather than the individual, as a unit captures the Japanese spirit. This was a delightful book in the vein of Will Ferguson's ""Hokkaido Highway Blues"" and Dave Barry's ""Dave Barry Does Japan.""

"I love DK books. When my son was younger, I used to buy him all the big DK books I could find at the local book store. They occupied and entertained him for hours! He had the original Star Wars Encyclopedia which he still has, but it's quite battered. He's 19 now, but I got him the DK Star Wars Encyclopedia for Rogue One this past Christmas. This edition is thick and heavy. It covers all of the Star Wars movies up until this point. It's full of beautiful, color photos from all of the movies. Details and descriptions go along with the photos. A lot of the information is more general, but it's informative and interesting.If you are looking for more technical and detailed information, you may want something more.  My 50 year old husband has been perusing it right now since our son is still away at college and has been enjoying it. Even my teenage daughter who isn't into the whole Star Wars thing has enjoyed skimming through it. This would be a great gift for any Star Wars fan!",positive
"This book is great to learn some basic spanish words.  Some of the words are a bit difficult to write for preschool-1, but is a great tool for teaching the basics of the language.  I recommend this book as a start to learning Spanish.",positive
"I really enjoyed Susan Vreeland's Clara and Mr. Tiffany.  It was a very well-written historical novel and provided a really interesting peek into the lives of women at the turn of the century, as they began to enter the male-dominated workplace and assert their independence.  Little snapshots of everything from the simple pleasure of riding a bicycle ('wheel') and romance at the turn of the century, to being a part of a creative team bringing to life an artists conception and contributing to a viable product.  I have always admired Tiffany Lamps, but have a whole new appreciation for them now.",positive

"Peter Bowler presents a synopsis of Charles Darwin's contributions to science, history, and culture. This book tries to provide a quick summary of the important periods in Darwin's life, touching briefly on each significant aspect.<br /> Much of the book is written in a somewhat technical way and is a bit too wordy. I had a difficult time maintaining my interest while I was reading some of the chapters. Certain areas deserved more coverage, like the reaction when Darwin went public with his theories.<br /> On the positive side, this book does give some good insight on Darwin's relationships with the other prominent scientists of his time and there are some moments where the slowness of the book becomes more interesting, like the section that covers Darwin's voyage of discovery aboard the Beagle. Overall, however, Bowler does not really present anything new or profound that we haven't heard before.",negative

"I've read and ejoyed many of Dean Koontz books.  This one, however seems to have been written by someone else.  Koontz tries to make the characters of this story interesting by pouring on lots of colorful dialog.  Unfortunately, the dialog is more corny than colorful.  I listened to the audio version of this book and found myself turning it off time and time again.  I just couldn't stand listening to the long-winded rants and multi-adjective descriptions that pepper much of the book.  Koontz tries hard to make his characters ""hip"", but he does not succeed.  One tip off to this is the unbelievably lame character names.  Leilani Klonk??????  C�mon Dean... what were you thinking.  I was very dissapointed in this offering from a writer who has proven he is capable of much, much better.",negative
"This is a beautifully written story that covers the span of more than 100 years. In each of the time periods visited, connections are discovered that intertwine. I found myself trying to figure out some of the connections and was delighted to learn of ones that I had not expected. It was a little difficult to keep everything straight with the jumping from era to era at first, but the more I read, the easier it became. Although this is a long book, I found it hard to put it down and read the whole book in just a few days. There's some mystery, romance, heartbreak, and more. I was a little disappointed with how it ended. I felt that it was a little abrupt and I wasn't satisfied how some things were left. It left me with a lot of questions.  I read The Secret Keeper by Morton a few years ago for my book club. I think I liked it a little more than this one, but this was good, too. Morton is a creative and gifted storyteller.",positive
"This book is very disappointing to me as a workbook: the exercise is EXCEEDINGLY repetitive. Please note I that I understand the importance of practice, but this one is going overboard, and it did so without really improving the understanding.<br /><br />As a trig book, it also misses a very important topic: graphing the sinusoidal functions, identifying period, midline, and amplitude. It has NONE of those. All in all, I think this is a LAZY collection of exercise and has 1/10 of the value that it is suppose to have.",negative

A very good book",positive
"Most of the books in the official ITIL series are required reading if you are implementing or pursuing ITIL certification. This one can, in my opinion, be safely ignored.<br />The key theme of the book is promotion of the ITIL and its benefits, and a high-level overview of implementation issues.  The areas covered include: describing the ITIL vision, helping you to determine your 'As Is' posture and your 'To Be' per the ITIL.<br />It also provides a roadmap to get from 'As Is' to 'To Be', checkpoints, and advice on how to maintain momentum during the implementation. This guide also gives an example cost-benefit analysis supporting for service management process implementation, a process maturity framework, and a glossary of terms.<br />A more detailed book that will easily supplant this one is &quot;IT Service Management: An Introduction&quot; (ISBN 9080671347).  It contains all of the information that this book provides, plus an in-depth look at each of the ITIL's key process areas, how they relate to one another, and better implementation advice.",negative
"Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store and I feel like she totally got ripped off.  Not at all reusable like the cover claims.  The stickers are less sticky, so you can reuse them once or twice at best.  But still, 75 stickers for this is still seriously overpriced.  And I especially don't like how many of the stickers are the exact same, over and over again.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a reusable sticker book, search amazon for the Melissa and Doug reusable sticker pad.  Totally awesome and a far better value since it's around the same price.<br /><br />If you want just stickers, search for the ""THOMAS' STICKER EXPRESS (Thomas & Friends) (Super Stickerific) [Paperback]""  with over 700 stickers.  A little bit more, but seriously a good value for the money.  If you don't have a thomsas/train lover, I'm not sure if Golden Book makes any other 700+ sticker books.... but I sure hope so, because this Thomas book is awesome (and I'm super stingy, so if I say $10+ for a coloring book/sticker book, believe me) :-)",negative

"When you finish this book and put it down, you can not help but feel for the author on her discovery of her parents: the part they played in history, the personal sacrifices and yet the author found all these pieces after her parents have passed on, unable to communicate to them her feelings.  It is hard to write about history objectively and let alone one when it involves your parents: brilliantly told and objective as much as she could be.  History told with a human touch and. It will certainly touch you at some level of your soul. Great read.",positive
"Super religious so a miss for me.  If I had dug a bit deeper I would have noticed the reviews that mention this.  I think the concept is decent I just don’t relate to the idea of Needing Jesus to direct me.  I mean no disrespect to people that believe  and people that are genuinely Christians, But as more and more Christians are openly hostile to many people that has turned me off completely to the concept. I believe in tolerance but I am intolerant of the intolerant.  It’s an OK book, well enough written but if you were like me and not religious or Christian in anyway you may find it a bit hard to wade through.",negative

"This book is very deficient in many aspects of palliative Medicine.

"The Wolf Wants In is a well written, page turner. I had a personal connection with this book. An old friend of mine recently died from addiction. She left behind two daughters who really didn't know their mother as she was absent most of their lives. While reading this, I couldn't help but think of my friend. The book actually gave me a little clarity and understanding to what my friend's life may have been like as an addict. The book alternates between points of view and timeline. The timeline was a little confusing for me. One POV was set 4 months earlier than the other POV. The timelines eventually catch up. But there were many times when I would have to work things out in my head before moving forward.  The book was labeled as a thriller, but I would classify it as more of a suspenseful mystery. Overall, I enjoyed this book.",positive
"The whole premise of this book was so insipid, like the writer was noodling around for a cute idea to write about as she sat on the train to work. And she started writing and wasn't at all sure where to go with it so she tried making the characters intriguing, but they weren't. Many of the voices were so similar you couldn't tell who was speaking except by looking at the very pale gray label at the top of the page. The people she portrayed were really pathetic, totally lacking a raison d'etre in life. I finished the book because I had nothing else to read at the moment.",negative
I have read and loved every Patricia Cornwell Scarpetta novel.  Flesh and Blood is fascinating for the first 85% of the book.  I read through her details of bullets and fragments because I know how well she researches details of every aspect of her books and because I was looking forward to the exciting ending we have come to expect.  I now know how to put on a scuba wet suit perfectly.  I am waiting anxiously for the climax.  Then Cornwell seems to think we are all satisfied to read a two-page encounter.  Then Cornwell wants us to wait until the next book to find out how the “epilogue” ends.  Very disappointing.,negative
"I went into this thinking I would like it, especially with the special introduction from the author that gave it such a personal twist and connection.  However, the story lost me pretty early on and I didn't finish it.  I hate to say that I gave up on it, but I realized that the approach wasn't what I expected and I think it needs a different audience.  If you like more fantasy elements mixed with current issues, this might be more up your alley than it was for me.  I wish I liked it more, but I had to move on.",negative

"I really liked ""The Historian"" and approached this book with enthusiasm, to be deeply disappointed.  The story is lackluster and essentially pointless, and worst of all the 3 supposedly different voices that tell what passes for a story are completey indistinguishable. It's a trivial, insignificant project best suited as a stand-in for Ambien (unless, of course, you're a painter, in which case PERHAPS the endless navel-gazing about painterly suffering might possibly be of interest to you).<br />If you HAVE to read it, borrow it from the library, don't waste money buying the thing.  It's just not worth it.",negative

Really a shame: it could have been so much better.",negative
"Six months ago Clare Lancaster discovered the body of her brother-in-law, Brad McAllister, and quickly became a suspect. A human lie detector, Clare knows or senses that all is not as it seems with those closest to the investigation. Clare, the newly discovered illegitimate daughter of Archer Glazebrook is considered an outsider and an unstable sensitive. Sent to discover just what is going on in Arizona, the very sexy/mysterious J&J Agent, Jake Salter, must dig deep and get to the truth about Brad's death, a mythical drug believed to enhance psychic powers, all while struggling to understand his growing feelings for Clare. As the body count rises, so does the passion between the two driven together by danger. When the killer is revealed, you won't be extremely surprised but mildly amused. I had a great deal of hope for this series, but now am not sure if I will merely read it to see how the eventual plot unfolds or if I will read it just to finish the series. I have two short criticisms, I am not sure I can take another Krentz book that mentions ""long leather coats, and high-heeled black boots. While this is only my third Krentz novel, more specifically the Arcane Society, I definitely see a varying theme....instead of giving so much detail about the beautiful heroine's clothing, maybe give a little more substance so that when certain plots are revealed, you will savor them. Also, some of the plots end abruptly and while I know that there is going to be a sequel, the way it is done leaves me feeling a bit unsatisfied.",negative

"I really wanted to enjoy this book and thought I would especially with the jacket cover quoting Stephen King &#34;A suspense master&#34;.<br /><br />I found the book to have too many flat characters (emotion never came through) with too many POVs. The setting in the small university town in upstate New York couldn't makeup for the weird coverup of sexual abuse with a story so jumbled it was hard to find a plot. The actual writing is ok, but the story makes no sense.<br /><br />A lot of repetition of the tragic things happening in the town, but it doesn't make for suspense.<br /><br />Maybe the author was trying for a horror story?",negative
"Definitely not a great &#34;feel good&#34; experience - most of these stories end far from the garden path or glorious sunset.  There is no doubt that they are well-written - beautifully written actually.  If you enjoy reading a collection of short stories just to appreciate the writing style, this may be for you.  What drives me crazy about a lot of short stories, is the way they dwindle off, leaving the reader wondering what in heck they are supposed to make of the ending.  You'll find that here.<br />Sorry - I appreciate good writing, but there have to be fleshed-out characters, well-described settings, and a story that grabs me and holds on.  I didn't find that here.",negative

Great read, won't want to put it down once you start.",positive
"KNITTED TEDDY BEARS: DRESSED WITH HANDKNITS has simple patterns for small (10""), medium (13""), and large (17"") bears.  I purchased this book because I thought the clothes (including undergarments!) were cute.  Nearly all of the clothing patterns are modeled in the cover photograph and the ""Look Inside This Book"" feature, which show the jacket, coat, overalls, sweater (striped version), and pants.  In addition, the book has patterns for an undershirt, boxer shorts, a scarf, a charming lacy dress, and a delightful pants suit with a lacy tunic.<br /><br />The patterns are written in row-by-row instructions.  This means that if you use the same yarn and needles for the basic bear and the clothing, the clothing will be sure to fit.  The bears are knit on double-pointed needles:  for the large bear, size US 8; for the medium bear, size US 4; for the small bears, sizes US 1.5 or US 2.5.  For the yarns used in the models, the brand names are given, but not the specific yarn gauges.  You can substitute any yarn that states on the label that it is suitable for knitting on the needle size you use.  The patterns recommend stuffing the bears with wool (but I would at least try stuffing mine with polyester fiberfill).<br /><br />This is quite a slender volume:  just 68 pages (including two pages for ""Notes"").  Because the book is so short, and has such a limited number of clothing patterns, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive
"We have been doing a lot of research recently about trips for the next couple of years and we thought A cruise would be a good way to hit Scandinavia. I really like the guide in general, it was a good introduction to the area and what is offered and had enough photos to kind of fire up the imagination. It is a bit more than a fodors guide but maybe not as good as the Eyewitness series, but the scope is perfect.  We have not done a cruise and Norway just seems as good a place as any to visit via cruise.  This book gave a great survey of ports of call and probably will be the only guide we will need if we are going to go this route.  Right now it seems like a great idea and this book gave us enough to feel informed about that decision.  Highly recommend if you are thinking about this cruise.",positive

"I can't get past the feeling that I am *supposed* to like this book.  ""Literary fiction"" as it's called - and I'm a literary person, I appreciate a well-crafted novel as much as the next English major.  But I could never manage to muster the same kind of adoration that has been heaped upon this book by so many other reviewers.  In fact, I could never manage to muster any kind of positive emotion at all.<br /><br />This is one long generational line of messed-up women.  I think I'm supposed to believe they are layered and complex.  But they all just came off as selfish to me, living totally for themselves.  Leaving children motherless, leaving husbands who had lost their fancy.  That's not to say that women should only live for their children and husbands - no, in fact I think the most responsible character was the one who never married OR had children.  BUT, she also never reconnected with her brother, who was trying to reach out to her.  Why are all these women completely unable to care for other people?!  I did not find one likeable character in this book, and it felt like an ultimate waste of time.<br /><br />The book plays on the them of ""The Woman Question"" over and over.  My only question about this book is:  Who Cares?",negative

Not only is it loose leaf, but where the holes are the pages are perforated guaranteeing that I will lose some of these pages...so I had to purchase enforcers to make sure it doesn't happen.  This was such a big expense that there is no way I can honestly give it a better review.",negative
"I really liked this book. However, there were a few ways it could have been better. For one, there was never really an outline about how to actually have the initial sex talk with your kids. So many books just skim that part. The part about how to have those beginning conversations. I also felt like they skirted around some of the topics. Just told you to consider some things, but never really definitely made a statement about those subjects. Had the book been a little longer, it could have been delved into those topics.",positive

"My children really enjoyed this book, and the other Fly Guy books, for that matter. They are not reading yet, so I cannot say that it is a particularly good reader.

They really got into helping describe these words. Yeah, it is kind of gross, but it is a fun gross<br />I'm not a fan of dividing a picture book up as a chapter book. It seems silly and inhibits the flow.",positive
"Kaya has been a part of the American Girl collection for a while now.  The AG company has recently decided to go from 6 books to 2 books for some of their popular characters. So they've basically abridged and condensed some of those books to make this one. This is a pretty adventurous and exciting book, especially when compared to other AG books. Kaya is a part of the Nez Perce Indians. Her timeline is back in the mid-1700's. This book gives a lot of insight to what a young Indian girl's life would be like during that time period. The illustrations are beautiful. One of my favorite sections of all the historical American Girl books is the ""Inside (Kaya's) World""  which provides some additional historical details. This book is entertaining and fun to read!",positive

The information is presented in an interesting and captivating way. The illustrations that go with it are beautiful! I'm embarrassed to say that I wasn't familiar with all of these young women. My daughter is 17 now and she has enjoyed skimming through it and picking out bit and pieces. Maybe it will inspire her!,positive
"Amherst was a huge disappointment. I was bored with it within the first two chapters and forced myself to finish so I could review it. The only parallel between the two &#34;romances&#34; was how shallow & self-absorbed the characters were.

"A friend who is as avid a reader of fantasy as I am recommended this book with great enthusiasm. I have to say, I am now a little dubious of his potential to recommend me books in the future.<br />This book is very predictable. In fact, it's so predictable, that I found myself waiting for the twist within a twist to slap me in the face, because the truth behind the lies in the book is so obvious. It never came. Apparently, I was actually supposed to be fooled.<br />If you can't guess the ending of the book and spoil the &quot;suprise&quot; for yourself very early on, then who knows - you might enjoy this book.

But happily these recordings were made, they saved Presley's career and reputation, and remain in print 50 + years down the line to remind us what a truly great talent the great man was.

"I have been to the Tuscany/Florence region twice in the last year and have another trip planned for this October. I originally wasn't going to select this book, thinking I already knew everything I needed to about this most beautiful area of Italy. But I received this Frommer's book and I am finding it a tremendous read! I am finding information on little known towns (for example Livorno) which I had never heard about in my travels (it's called the Venice of Tuscany). The book is a perfect size for travelers, recommending some wonderful restaurants in the cities (some of which I will also be trying in October)and many little known towns and tourist attractions (in addition to the more well known Florence/Pisa/Lucca/Sienna attractions. The pictures are beautiful, maps are all inclusive and the guide is written in clear English (to assist when in the areas where some may not speak the language). Hours of operation of tourist attractions as well as entrance fees are all in there was well. If anyone is traveling to Italy and plans to spend any time in the Tuscany region, this is a must read and take along. I highly recommend for all!",positive

Of particular note is the artwork on the title page, a couple of seldom seen photographs of Northrop/McDonnell Douglas' YF-23 Black Widow II prototype, and of course, a wealth of great photographs of the star of the show - the F-22 Raptor - from the YF-22 and YF-23 demo/eval through recent deployments overseas. This book has something for everybody. Among my favorite F-22 Raptor photographs - the pictures of an F-22 and F-15 Strike Eagle in air-to-air maneuvers, the F-22 Demo Team Raptor in action, and the F-22 escorting a Russian Tu-95 Bear bomber flying near the Alaskan NORAD Region airspace. The variety of photos and great artwork make this a ""Must Have"" for F-22 Raptor enthusiasts and model airplane hobbyists!",positive

"Danny delivers the true Chicago story, as he lived it, in this hard-hitting, but also incredibly warm & humor-filled memoir.  He's as tough on himself as he is on his former band-mates.  But he's also as kind & forgiving as humanly possible after dealing with the bitterness of his betrayal by those friends (brothers, really) who fired him from the band he co-founded.  As Chicago membership has become something of a revolving door in recent years (PBS's recent Chicago II Live in Concert looked for all the world like Robert Lamm, James Pankow & Lee Loughnane playing with a tribute band), bringing Danny Seraphine and his great personality & drumming skills back into the fold might go a long way toward making it all seem real again.  We live in hope ...  I first bought & read this book back in 2012, and passed that copy along to a fellow Chicago fan (& friend).  Docked one star because I had hoped for an &#34;updates&#34; chapter or two; regardless, an excellent read.",positive

"I am amazed and baffled that such good writers who have the successful series going on with their truly grand character(Agent Pandergast), can come up with such lackluster book. And to make things worse.. they are trying to introduce a new character/series. I thought that Gideon would be introduced at such a grand level that people will forget agent Pandergast and he will become a thing of the past.<br />I think here lies a lesson for P/C, ""stick with Pendergast!"", as thats what they do best. I don't think I am alone here where I feel that we just can't get enough of Pandergast. I also think that the reason there is an overwhelmingly negative response to their introductory new series is for another reason as well, the fans don't want to share their love of agent Pandergast and they don't want the writers to waste half of their energies and time writing this series-- but they want the whole attention to be given to Pandergast. I think Mr. Gideon Crew will keep getting this ""step brother"" treatment.<br />If someone reading this hasn't started that(Pandergast)series, then that's what they should do instead of buying this book.",negative

"First of all, some readers have placed this in the ""fantasy"" genre, which makes no sense to me. It is middle grade fiction, best described as ""medieval,"" I guess, because of Kings and kingdoms and such, but there are really no elements I would associate with ""fantasy"" (magic, potions, mythical beasts, etc).<br />Second, the only reason this isn't a 5-star review is because I could see the slow, deliberate pace of the book being a drawback for many readers, even though I loved it. It's not necessarily ""thrilling"" like some reviews say, but I did find it very satisfying at every turn.<br />I found the writing tight, the dialogue clever, the characters complicated and enjoyable. There is a bit of violence and definitely some intrigue, but ZERO language or sexual content, with barely even a hint at possible romance. This book is about the STORY, and I think that's great.<br />Perhaps the only drawback for me was that some of the secrets and intrigue got a little jumbled up at the end and I found it hard to follow exactly what was happening. Sort of like the high points of a James Bond movie - too many intersecting plots and secrets make it a bit confusing. But this didn't override the fact that I really liked this book. I look forward to the rest of the series!",positive
"I am a chopped fan and thought this would be an interesting addition to my cookbook collection.  I would have preferred a spiral back.

"This is my second, and last, Kleypas book. The story was dull (dumb might be a better word), with the hackneyed ""they disliked each other, but it was true love really"" storyline yet again. Lots of sex though, way more than really needed to tell the story, so that must be how the author likes to fill out her story and titillate susceptible readers. I found the hero unlikeable, rude, and rather too domineering (taking the ""strong male"" meme a bit too far). And some of his actions could easily be seen as non-consensual fondling and fornication, although the heroine later says she liked it and wanted it. Somewhat gaggy, frankly, although I liked the feisty heroine.<br /><br />But it gets worse. There an abduction and molestation near the end, and explicitly threatened rape. Of course the villain goes free after a beating. And of course he appears in the next book in the series as a reformed rake, and his victim's friend becomes his mate-for-life. And everyone is just over the moon about it. Major gag.<br /><br />Clearly Kleypas lives in a different moral universe than I do. She has readers willing to join her there, too. Definitely not for me.",negative

"I’ve been progressively more disappointed with King’s offerings since Dreamcatcher and officially retired my Constant Reader title after The Outsider. I guess a misguided sense of loyalty and a huge number of rave reviews led me to take one more chance. Hard to believe that Mr. King wrote this awkward, poorly paced, and just plain bad novel! His characters have always been charismatic and complete; the reader’s entire experience hinges on feeling some interest in and attachment to, those characters. Lisey and her supporting cast evoked only boredom and annoyance. Nine chapters into the book, and we’re STILL hearing Widow Lisey’s internal musings over and over and over again. Now there are some teaser words in italics interjected to make sure you know that there’s more to the story than what you’re getting so far, but it’s crudely done and hard to care about. The cutsie nonsense words and insider jokes/phrases is likewise excessive. When you are 30% of the way into a book and you are STILL waiting for some kind of story to start, there’s a problem. All I can say is that IF SK REALLY wrote this book, I’m embarrassed for him.",negative
"Part mystery story, part inspired classic novel, interspersed narrative poem on life and love, infused with current themes made universal through come-to-life battles between 18th-centtury Puritans and Druid priestesses, Kaplan-Maxfield has penned a fascinating and beautifully complex oeuvre. For the literary, it's full of metaphorically rich prose flowing polished from his pen. For the young, it's a gothic mystery about love and longing and the quest to unravel life's mysteries while learning about love, ancestral teachings, power, and sacred truths--told through the eyes of modern-day Nikki and her ancestral mother Anne. For those not so young, it gifts the exciting rhythm of youth tempered by wisdom perhaps not yet acquired. It is also a tightly crafted contemporary novel with captivating depth about olden ways full of lessons for modern morass. Arcing through post-stormy-passages poetic rainbows reveal insights about men and women, science and religion, sacredness and truth, and learning to live with the constraints we are dealt.",positive

"I AM NO ONE: A NOVEL tells the story of an ordinary man (Jeremy) who runs afoul of the ubiquitous present-day U.S. government surveillance of Its own citizens.<br /><br />Returned to the U.S. after spending 10 years in England, Jeremy is teaching German history at New York University. However, something about his data profile captures the interest of his governmental watchers, and sets in motion a series of events that only confuse and puzzle their  oh-so-ordinary subject (Jeremy).  Jeremy is in danger, but doesn't know it, let alone the &#34;why&#34; of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the entire 341-page novel is told in first-person (mostly stream-of-consciousness) narrative.  It's a real slog, because Jeremy IS so ordinary.  The message of the book (I think) is that a world without personal privacy isn't worth living in.<br /><br />In my opinion, that simple message isn't nearly enough to justify such a long book about a nobody.  (You can read the publisher's product page description for a pretty good capsule summary of the actual events in the novel.)  I rate this boring novel at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative

I definitely prefer a visual guide for the start of planning just to get the dreaming going.  I prefer Eyewitness guides to Fodors, but there is a plethora of information here.  In fact, it looks like they may have broadened the scope too far.  We will be limited to Thailand so we do not need Laos and Cambodia.  I would have preferred more focus on just Thailand.  Reading through the travel basics was great and I learned a lot but it will take some time to digest the site and lodging descriptions.  I'm glad I got this book, but will need more.",positive

"I am a former elementary school teacher, but I am currently a paraprofessional in a middle school special education classroom.  It is a mild intellect class, so the kids have low reading levels. The reading levels are slightly higher than most of our students with lexiles in the 500-600s range, but for guided reading that's okay. There are 6 sets of 6 cards. Each card is heavy weight and laminated. I was impressed with how sturdy they are! They have lots of great photo illustrations which are interesting and engaging. The non-fiction subjects are appropriate. Half of the cards are science themes and the rest of social studies. There are teacher cards that go along with these with general questions to ask of the students. There are no answer keys, but the questions are general enough that there are several possible correct answers. These will help a lot with summarizing non-fiction text! The classroom teacher that I work with loves this set so much, that she plans to purchase some of the other guided reading sets available.",positive
"""It's a book!"" ""It's a game!""<br /><br />There is no story in this book. Just random pages with phrases written with numbers in the words.

"Austenland is the story of Jane Hayes, ""a thirty-something woman in possession of a satisfying career and a fabulous hairdo,"" who finds herself unmarried and harboring a dangerous obsession with the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice.  Her aged great-aunt figures out Jane's little secret and leaves something special for Jane in her will:  an all expense paid trip to Pembrook Park, Kent, England.<br /><br />At Pembrook Park, Austen's world comes alive with everyone taking on a different ""character"" and every detail of Victorian life painstakingly reproduced (right down to the corsets!).  It is quite funny to follow Jane's slow conversion to playing along with things, and read about her internal struggle between fantasy and reality.  I laughed out loud several times, and found myself smiling through nearly the entire reading.<br /><br />If this book hasn't been optioned as a film yet, it should be.  PRONTO!  That way I can eventually put the DVD right next to my own copy of the A&E masterpiece and have more outlets for my own Austen addiction!",positive

"For some reason, I can never warm to the Monkeewrench gang.  They’re the sorta-genius misfits who’ve formed Monkeewrench Software, and apparently you need to start with the early books to appreciate the personalities.  The three series novels that I’ve read are all police procedurals involving crimes that get solved with the aid of the extraordinary, almost magical, research capabilities of the Monkeewrench computer experts.<br /><br />In ICE COLD HEART: A MONKEEWRENCH NOVEL, a woman is found murdered in a bondage situation--suffocated by duct tape wound around her head.  The victim was married and well off; soon it becomes clear that she was involved in some sort of consensual relationship with her killer.<br /><br />As things develop, a picture emerges of a cruel serial killer with an ice cold heart.  By the end of the book, the detectives and the Monkeewrench crew are engaged in a race against time to save the lives of two additional women who’ve crossed paths with the killer.<br /><br />The book is well written, but the plot is thin. Much of the “story” is about the interpersonal relationships of the established characters, and about the amazing computer research performed.  Since I don’t particularly care about any of the characters, and since I am no longer awed by research feats accomplished with computers, I thought the novel was slow-moving and boring.  It was kind of all downhill after the opening few chapters and the crime scene.",negative
"I've read that John Ringo basically wrote the books in this series over the course of a few months of frantic writing.  I have not read the others, but this was a gritty description of commando style spy antics combined with almost BDSM sexual scenes.<br /><br />The military scenes and descriptions are solid.  However, they couldn't carry the story and the overall plot just felt a bit thin.  The sexual scenes felt almost forced at time and did not expand much upon the plot.  I could see a male reader wishing he was the main character with his almost mystical ability to pleasure a woman and win her adoration, but in a way the scenes detracted from the characters and their impact.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have read books 1 and 2 first so I could get more into the story, but I was able to figure out the basic personalities of most of hte characters, even if I did not know how they became friends and allies.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that will only be enjoyed by a select audience.  The sexual scenes will be considered offensive by some, but as always John Ringo's personal politics bleed into the politics of his writing.  As a writer he has a great talent, but his works can end up seeming a bit juvenile due to his style and politics.  This one fell into the juvenile category.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.  There are other better books out there.",negative

"This is a great book by J.K. ROwling. This books focus is not fairytale and magic of Harry Potter land but the harsh reality of classicism. She came from a very meager background and I am certain she used that as inspiration for this complex stories where most of the characters are flawed but complex. The story is not a far stretch from what it is like to loive in slums that are just a stones throw from the Upper Class and how the poor are marginalized and vilified. Many do not like the book because they want more of her Harry Potter writing but this book demonstrates her fluidity as a writer and her compassion, she is a very large philanthropist and has opened centers for disadvantaged children.<br />Book arrived to a friend first and it was nearly 24 hours after order placed.",positive
"I can endure the lack of indention, proper punctuation, and difficult navigation (basically impossible) in this large collection of Trollope's writing, BUT it's unacceptable the number of occasions that I move to the next page and the text is missing. I've landed somewhere nearby, but definitely NOT in the sentence I was in. It's impossible to truly know how much I've missed--a few sentences or paragraphs? An entire page? I could overlook this if it only happened once or twice, but it happens ALL THE TIME. It's infuriating to have to wonder whether you're going to turn the page and remain in the same sentence....or be randomly jolted somewhere farther into the narrative that may or may not be related to what you were reading on the previous page! SO ANNOYING! Don't bother with this version by Delphi. I'm going to take a chance on the $4 collection by a different publisher that includes more of Trollope's writings. It's fairly important to feel confident that you're going to remain in the same sentence from one page to the next.",negative

Nothing of great interest. Just boring.

"The idea here was one I had a ton of hope for.  There is a reason that games like Stardew Valley and Rune Factory work, and that is that people love the idea of helping rebuild a small community through farming and adventure.  And so the idea that a young man winds up falling through a portal and taking over a small farm on a rock floating in the sky seemed like a tale with tons of potential.<br /><br />Sadly, the three female characters here all were the type that I hate.  They existed as tropes and were lacking in much agency.  Each one was designed as a fantasy for the author, and it was clear he was seeing himself as the main character.  Some readers will love that, but for me it ended up lacking.  I want to read about people I'd enjoy meeting and chatting with.  I actually have a hard time putting myself in the role of the main character in most tales, and this kind of harem fantasy definitely is not a genre that draws me in easily.<br /><br />This was one of the worst of the genre in my opinion.  As I said, I disliked the three female characters due to their lack of agency and personality.  But I will warn, that my opinion is based on my personal preferences.  I expect someone who likes this kind of tale will very much enjoy this book.",negative

"Unlike some of these reviewers, I forced myself to read on to the end because I thought it would have to get better.  It didn't.  I just did not enjoy reading about this man who wastes all his gifts and opportunities, then goes on for years wallowing in self pity.  His whining seriously reminded me of what you hear at AA or ALANON meetings (with the addition of a few more interesting historical and artistic references).<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I am not really familiar with Rousseau? But shouldn't this novel have inspired me to find out more?  That is one of the most incredible thing about good writing; a great book sends you onto paths you might not have discovered for yourself.  Instead, this book left me with no interest whatsoever in the life and writings of the man J.J.Todd admired most.<br /><br />Then, after sticking with it for 475 pages, this is the ending you're given?  Maybe someone could explain it to me and I might change my mind in thinking that the author just ran out of energy and motivation to invent a satisfying conclusion to the story of this loser.<br /><br />I liked his book Restless, but I wouldn't recommend New Confessions to anyone.",negative

The first part of the book goes over wedding basics from flowers, stationery, dress basics, picking a venue date, etc. The second part provides ideas for the six wedding styles of romantic, lavish, modern, elegant, rustic, and vintage.<br /><br />As I was reading through this, I like the questions proposed that allows the bride and groom to decide what type of wedding they are looking for. This books entices one to dream and provides reasons for hiring a pro, deciding what type of calligraphy one might want on their invitations, etc. Obviously, this is mostly for people who have money to spend or at least what to dream what they would do with it if they had it. It is less useful for those spending less than $10,000 on a wedding.<br /><br />The only big negative is that some of the text in this lovely volume is written in white letters over pale pink or medium pinkish letters over pale pink making it very hard to read those sections--especially for my aging eyes. In addition, the front cover of my book was creased which distorted the word ""wedding"" as can be seen in one of my photos. It is mainly for these two reasons I took off one star. Other than this, this coffee table wedding book is just gorgeous and contains lots to consider before planning one's big day.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/4/2020 - I gave this to my upstairs neighbor who is a bride-to-be and she said she likes the way this book is laid out. She said this is very nicely done.",positive
"I have been an avid fan for many years of Ninjalicious's E-zine Infiltration ([...]), a website devoted to exploring the bowels of those places you're not supposed to go: city hospitals, hotels, subway tunnels, abandoned factories, the works. Sadly, Ninjalicious passed away in August 2005 from a terminal illness, but his love of exploration (and a good yarn!) lives on in Access All Areas.<br /><br />Urban exploration is not for everyone: it is generally illegal, dirty, claustrophobic, and can be downright dangerous, if not fatal (exploring subway tunnels when the trains are in use, risk of electrocution from stepping on the third electrified rail in subway tunnels, asbestos and other toxic chemicals in abandoned factories, drowning if drains flash flood, etc.). For me, I enjoyed reading Ninj's adventures exploring working subway tunnels, abandoned breweries, barging in on hotel swimming pools pretending to be a guest, and other hands-off areas of Toronto.<br /><br />Ninjalicous's writing style and down-to-earth pointers about Urban Exploration (he can most definitely be considered one of the sport's founders), along with the ever-present naughty thrill of ""will you be caught?"" makes it an exciting hobby (please note, I'm an armchair Urban Explorer -- I've never tried exploring Toronto's subways, hospitals, abandoned breweries, or hotels in person, I'm just a fan of Ninjalicious and the *idea* of Urban Exploration.) Rest in peace, Ninjalicious, and thanks for the years of thrills!",positive
"In today's world, the parent like the one in &#34;Love You Forever&#34; is known as a helicopter parent.  Bottom line, this isn't a good book, it's a very disturbing story about the extremely unhealthy relationship that a parent has for her child - a relationship that indicates that the parent is in serious need of psychiatric help, can ruin her child's life, and doesn't know the meaning of boundaries.  So as not to inflict any further harm, this book belongs in the trash.",negative
"this was a really interesting book, especially if you are a history lover.  However, I found the switching back and forth between characters and places very confusing.  Especially at first, when I was just being introduced to characters and situations.  It would have been better if the beginning had gone a little slower in that respect.  Once I got on board with the characters, I really liked it, especially the Smithsonian connection.  I highly recommend this book, and urge readers to stick it out, even if the beginning seems confusing.",positive
"I ordered this book as I was involved with operation Hickory.  I was only in country two months when my regiment was assigned duty along the DMZ.  At the young age of 19, I had no knowledge of what happened during my deployment in the operation.",positive
"So disappointed. I expected so much more than this dry, pedantic, with no suspense and the characters are like cardboard. From the first page you know who's going to kill whom and no one person in the book is likeable. This charmless piece of work is not worth the paper it's printed on or the time to read it. In my view, I would recommend mysteries by Josephine Tey, Georgette Heyer and even Agatha Christie.",negative
"I love John Grogan, he has always been one of my favorite writers. The Longest Trip Home is a book which almost anyone can relate to. Being from a Catholic-background family, I especially found the book to be relevant, heartwarming and brought me back to my childhood. There were moments I laughed and moments I cried, but most of all there were moments that brought me back almost 30 years to my childhood growing up in New York. Grogan sure knows how to tell a story. I absolutely loved The Longest Trip Home and will be making a stocking stuffer of it for my mom for Christmas!!",positive

"The Way We Fall by Megan Crewe is a pretty darn good read. Kaelyn, the main character, lives with her family on an island. The book is written as a journal or diary of sorts from Kaelyn to her former best friend who is no longer living on the island. Kaelyn is trying to make some positive life changes and open up a bit more when a virus hits the island. You follow the story as Kaelyn's world falls apart. You feel her hope and her despair along the way. It is definitely a worthwhile read. It could have been better. There could have been a little more attention to some of the details. Certain aspects of the story could have been a bit more dramatic. It felt a bit like Ms. Crewe was holding back a bit, perhaps for the sake of the intended audience (teens). But that holding back took a bit of the excitement out of the book. I felt the love interest in the book was a little bit forced. Who gets a boyfriend when everyone is dropping dead from a virus? The characters were well developed. The story felt complete. I liked it.<br /><br />Parental blurb since this is young adult fiction- violence, but not as graphic as it could have been. Some cursing. Mentions of homosexuality. That's about it. I don't have a recommended age, because that would really be up to you on this one.",positive
Alice Starmore is one of my favorite Fair Isle designers along with Marie Wallin. The patterns on the illustrations are impressive. This is an older publication so shapes of the sweaters are somewhat dated. The Fair Isle design can but used with a different type of sweater.

Features a  pattern for a beautiful pair of Fair Isle gloves that I plan on knitting.,positive
"CAN NEUROSCIENCE CHANGE OUR MINDS? is a political tract, co-authored by two neuroscientists.  They are concerned--as science unravels more and more of the functions of the human brain--that governments are unrealistically expecting &#34;brain science&#34; to solve all future human social, developmental, and behavioral problems.<br /><br />This is NOT a book for a general reader like myself, who has only a casual interest in neuroscience.  I mistakenly thought it was a popular science book about the latest research into how human brains work.",negative
"What a creative story.  I read this with my 4th grade class.  It started so many discussions and it was the number one pick for the end of the year raffle prize! Some of my students were so quiet this year, not really feeling confident about returning to school.  This story opened a door that many students walked through and they talked about being anxious, scared, or depressed.  I highly recommend this book and will be following this author.",positive
"This book is cute. My daughter loves it. She loves My Little Ponies. Not a hard sell, there. However, this book is written to be a Level 1 Beginning Reader. A Level 1 book should contain simple words, repeating letter patterns, and repeating phrases. This book has none of those things. Taking out words in the book and putting pictures in their place does not make it a Level 1 Reader. This book contains words that are very difficult for a beginning reader to read. This book is for the child fluent in reading, not a beginner. I'm very disappointed in the quality of Readers. They slap a popular character on the book and write a lack-luster story and say it is a Beginning Reader. It isn't. It is a cheap picture book with a lacking story line. Yes, my daughter liked the book. But no, she couldn't even come close to reading it.",negative

"Purchased this for my 83 year old Mom, she loves the author.  This is a series in case you're interested in checking into it.  I think it is actually #1 of 3 (?).  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6,000 reviews posted, viewed over 50,000 times, and over 24,000 likes.",positive
"I travel a lot. Have been to Rome three times and I am always looking for new places to explore. This National Geographic Traveler guide to Rome is incredible.

I am returning to Rome again in November of this year and this guide will be with me all the way. Kudos to National Geographic, best tourist guide on the market today!",positive
"Unfortunately I only received the flash cards for this set to review. From what I can tell from the flash cards it looks like a great program. My 5 year old granddaughter is finally getting the hang of reading so I was really looking forward to testing out this method with her to get her more comfortable. Without any instructions we just started doing the flashcards, one group at a time and I was surprised by how eager she was to keep doing more. We could have probably gone through the whole box in one sitting. My 8 year old grandson also enjoyed doing the flashcards and was stumped by a few of the longer more difficult words. I wish I knew how the flashcards fit into the program and how to use them properly.",positive
This is a joke. It's basically a bunch of printed pages stapled together. There is tops 15- 20 pages in the whole text. That's almost a dollar per page! It's not informative and is missing good examples. Don't waste your money. Get E squared instead.,negative
"2/3 of the way through I was enjoying this tale.  it had a few flaws and I felt that it was progressing a bit slowly, but I like Karen Hashimoto, and the rest of the cast was showing signs of development, something that you don't get with every superhero tale.<br /><br />Sadly, while the story was mostly fun, the last act was one of the bigger turnoffs I've run into in superhero fiction.  I don't think the disaster that was Seanan McGuire's Velveteen vs the Seasons annoyed me quite as much as the 3rd act did here.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine, but the way this story ended made me go from liking this tale to absolutely hating the tale, in just a few pages.  It felt wrong.  It didn't make any of the characters step up and be heroic, and sadly it felt &#34;cheap&#34;.  I can't say it was a surprise.  I saw it coming, but it still just left me feeling frustrated that I had read all those pages for that ending.<br /><br />There is an epilogue 2 based on a theoretical alternate universe.  It felt like S.J. Delos knew that the ending was likely to upset people and this had been thrown in to try to placate anyone upset with the ending.  To me that only increases the disappointment I had.  S.J. needed to believe in the ending they wrote, and I just didn't get a feeling that that was true here.<br /><br />Sad really.  But I can't give this more than 2 stars.  That is my level of disappointment with the ending.",negative

"This is a suspenseful story. It's about a young woman who has been dealing with a lifetime of nightmares. She gets married and then the day after the wedding she's in an accident. From then, the story is told in different point of views - the husband, the young woman as a child, her mother, and her father. The story is finding the truth behind the nightmares. It deals with some mental disorders, possibly bipolar, that makes it a little difficult to know what's true and what's not. I read the book in just about a day. It was very quick paced. I did feel that the author used way too many parentheses in the story. I get that it's a literary device, but it was overused in the book and I found it to be very annoying after a while.",positive

"I love the WunderKeys series.  I started with the preschool and continued into the kindergarten with my then 4 yr old student.  It was amazing how easy it was for him to understand and grasp the concepts.  Plus, he absolutely loved the games (with a few modifications). The games are a little tricky for someone so young so we simplified.  He loved them anyway and didn't know the difference and still grasped the concepts the games were teaching.  Each lesson is perfectly laid out and my little one rarely got bored, except for when he just would refuse to play ;)",positive
"Normally, I really enjoy a good Margolin story, but this one was lacking. I would have given the novel a 2.5, and I was not so moved to give it a 3. I loved some of the story, but most of it was silly. I work in law enforcement and deal with cold cases, so the whole evidence tampering was possible, but I thought the motive was silly. If someone did manufacture evidence, I don't think it would have happened like this. I thought that the Crime Scene Tech who began initially committing perjury because he believed the people were guilty, but he definately stepped over the line when he killed Mary, his partner. I think the fact that Amanda Jaffe and her father appeared was one of the most redeeming factors in the novel, but overall, I thought that it was lacking.",negative

"THE NOWHERE MAN is the second &#34;Orphan X&#34; novel, and it's a high-octane, page-turning thriller.  However, it's extremely brutal.  The Nowhere Man (aka Orphan X, aka Evan Smoak) unselfishly helps ordinary people out of serious, life-threatening trouble, but in the end he's nothing more than a highly skilled, U.S. Government-trained, freelance assassin.  He has been taught to kill people, and that's what he does, over and over again, throughout the novel.<br /><br />In the novel, a teen-age girl calls the Nowhere Man for help when she is about to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery.  Evan responds and takes out the mastermind of the human trafficking operation.  But when he is cleaning up some loose ends, he is kidnapped, and then imprisoned in a remote, snowed-in chalet.  His captor (Rene) is a genteel but ruthless villain who wants the $27 million held in one of Evan's many concealed bank accounts.  In managing his escape, Evan leaves many, many, many bodies behind.<br /><br />The plot is reasonably interesting, but it's almost entirely driven by well-written, high-action, bloody fight scenes in which Evan dispatches guards and old enemies by working with minimal tools (e.g., a napkin ring, a trash bag), and by coming up with creative plans to gain just the slightest advantage over his captors.  I found this book entertaining--in a horrid fascination sort of way--but one &#34;Orphan X&#34; novel is definitely all that I ever want to read.",positive

"I received a sample section of this book and I have to say that it does have some intriguing qualities.  The art work is spare and not the most masterful, but definitely works well.  Combined with spare text, the reader is pulled through the pages and I was left at the end of the sample way too soon.  I only have a hint at the plot but I am interested enough that I would love to finish the book when it comes out.  I am a little disappointed to have just a little taste of the book, but it holds promise.",positive
"Costa Rica is a destination that my family has seriously been considering. And now after reading through this guide book, we're even more excited about going there. The book is a good sized travel book. It's an average book size not a pocket size. The pages are not as high quality as some travel guides, but they are colorful and chock full of information. There are plenty of maps, photos and tips all focused on Costa Rica. There's a pull out map in the back that's made of a sturdier glossy paper. While no single guide book can contain everything, this does cover a lot.",positive
"This book covers several types of dementias (Alzheimer's disease, Lewy-body dementia, vascular dementia, & frontotemporal dementia); however, it predominately concentrates on Alzheimer's. Each chapter is designed to stand on its own but I read this cover to cover and find it is comprehensive. It talks about dementia tests, drugs, what scams not to fall for, day-to-day care, reality orientation and validation therapy for those with Alzheimer's, what to look for in a caregiver, etc. It focuses more on the caregiver side and soft skills associated with dementia and less on the scientific aspect of the disease.<br /><br />This is a comprehensive text but is not the only text that is needed in my opinion, especially if one has a dementia other than Alzheimer's. For instance, I have a friend who I suspect has Parkinson's with Dementia (PDD) of the Lewy body kind and I feel [[ASIN:193260393X A Caregiver's Guide to Lewy Body Dementia]] is a much better resource for that disease.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a great Alzheimer's for dummies book and a good demenia (of any other kind) for dummies book.",positive
"The Amazon description and the back cover made this book sound much more exciting than it actually turned out to be. Any historical fiction book about WW2 usually holds my interest, but I had to make myself finish this one. The writer simply doesn't do a good job of making the story flow well. Harlow uses words and dialects peculiar to the region, but offers no glossary or explanation as to what they mean. Her writing style seems very flat, for lack of a better word.<br />My overall reaction was that I was glad I only paid $2.99 for this in a used bookstore, because it was quite a boring read.",negative

"This is a very believable backstory, and well written.  It stands well on its own and fleshes out the relationship between Catwoman and Bruce Wayne very well.  I feel like the table has been set for a very good Catwoman series.  It is raw and gritty, but definitely for a more mature audience.  There is a good amount of swearing and adult themes, and a kitten is killed by abuse.  Also there are themes of child abuse, so it may not be great for very young or sensitive readers.<br /><br />The illustration is strong and there is obviously a very gifted artist behind it.  The story reads very fast and keeps you engaged, as do the renderings.  Very good start to the series, and I plan to keep an eye on it.",positive
"One Extra Corpse is the second entry in Hambly's Silver Screen mystery series. Emma's husband died in WWI and, after losing her parents and brother as well, she eventually ends up in Los Angeles with her sister in law Kitty, a gorgeous and untalented star of silent film. This is a light and a well-researched, well-written and well-plotted mystery. Without risking spoilers, Hambly examines the early days of the studio system where stars were made because of how they looked.  We learn about the common practice of ensuring notoriously gay actors appear in public with ""romantic"" people of the opposite sex.  Extras were were so expendable that they risked life and limb to appear in crowd scened involving guns or explosives.  The casting couch entry to the profession was definitely in place. Hollywood was a small, small town when it came to knowing everyone's business. Hambly weaves in famous actors and directors whose backstories are known to  us. Emma has a cameraman boyfriend, Zal.  It's been four years since she left England and this budding relationship has potential,  but she sometimes longs to be back in England continuing her studies at Oxford. In addition to serving as Kitty's assistant, Emma has work as a screenwriter. This could be problematic as her knowledge of ancient history is frequently set aside when, for example she's instructed to make a character Christian in a period falling eighty years before the birth of Jesus. I enjoyed this enough to buy the first book in the series so I can fill in the back story. Fun characters, fun geographical background, fun locale, interesting resolution to the murder. Definitely recommend.",positive

"THE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN is an occasionally amusing, but wholly inconsequential cartoon book for adult women.  It's a riff on historical misconceptions about females, as propounded by famous men such as Darwin, Ruskin, Freud, Picasso, and Rousseau.<br /><br />The humor is marred by the hyperbole and generally bitter tone of the text.  For example:  &#34;Marie Curie is the only female scientist since women began.  Girls weren't allowed to study science because their reproductive organs made them irrational, and abstract thought doesn't get the curtains hung,  They were allowed to collect insects as you can do that in your own garden.&#34;<br /><br />For a book that takes about 20 minutes to read, it's pricey (hardcover, $12.99).  Probably quite a few feminists will find this in their Christmas stockings.  However, the reaction of this feminist to the catalog of erroneous historical assertions is: &#34;So what?  People know better now, and it's a waste of energy to harangue a bunch of dead men.&#34;<br /><br />For the above reasons, I rate THE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative
"EVERYTHING I loved about the actual Peter Grant novels is absent here - the nuanced text, the skilful character development, the short- and long-frame story arcs tightly linked, and the depth and grace of situational observation.<br />NONE of that is present in this cartoon snippet.

First let me say I review a lot of cookbooks. Rarely do I ever have any that don't grab me in some way. I got all the way to page 85 in this one and hadn't marked a single recipe. Not one.

"This book is perfect for those who do not want to plough through volume of data about a trip, but is looking for a quick review of key sights, best time to go, some maps and general transportation details and off we go!<br /><br />the trips vary from walking around a city to real rural locations where a car is a must.  We loved this book for all of the above features to plan for a long weekend trip: found it allows you to change the order of sight seeing point.  Some of the trips can be as long as 7 days, but there were many trips in the 2 days region.  it also gives you a section on which places are best to visit during the 4 seasons!  You could even cut one of the 7 day trip into 3 days just focusing on the sights that you really want to see; or even link two 2-day trip together as the book provides a number of trips within a local area.<br /><br />easy to carry and we love the freedom to roam as we wanted and this book gave us some focal points as we felt like doing.  Not too many rules!  So if you are like us, short of ideas for a little get away, dont want a travel book that tells you everything, but enough for you to discover things yourself then this is the reference book for you.  this is great if you are local in the NE as there were all these wonderful places that I never heard off and also great for those who are here for a vacation and want to get away from the usual tourist traps.",positive
"I've been a fan of DK Smithsonian books since my kids were young. This one is just as incredible as the other ones we have purchased over the years. The pictures and diagrams are detailed and interesting. I personally spent over an hour perusing through it when it first arrived. It gives thorough explanations on how our bodies work. I learned more than a few things about the human body from this book. The book is geared toward 4th - 7th grade, but I think it is appropriate for older grades and adults, too. I like that it has a &#34;matter of fact&#34; approach to our bodies and doesn't try to make it cute and funny.",positive
"First, let me preface this review by saying I am not a big science fiction fan.  So, if you are, you may like this book.  I found it incredibly boring and repetitive.  As with all of Stephenie Meyer's books, they have sections where you are gripped and want to find out more, but the vast majority seems to just drag on.  I think most of her books could be cut in half and make them more readable.  I liked the Twilight Series, but this one I didn't really care for at all.",negative

I've read hundreds of books but this one is just ridiculous- not the story itself but the sheer number of different characters will constantly keep you confused.  Also, I don't understand why she portrays her mother as a saint when she did absolutely nothing to protect her children!  I didn't feel badly at all about what happened to her mother because she deserved it.  I'm a mom and I would kill someone if they hurt my child.",negative

"Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey in the fall of 2012 and Money Island and Bay Point located in the Bayshore area of Cumberland County, New Jersey were never rebuilt. Instead they are like ghost towns with only a resident or two remaining as of 2019.<br /><br />I never heard of these shore towns on the New Jersey side of the Delaware Bay. I also thought it was mostly the ocean-side communities that were hardest hit. This author grew up in the Bayshore area and then left and came back to write this story. These towns were forgotten during Sandy's rebuild mostly due to the fact that it did not make economic sense to put money where tourism dollars were unlikely to be spent. Instead many homeowners sold out to the Blue Acres program that bought up the properties to turn it back into nature.<br /><br />What I found very disconcerting was that the Health Department in Cumberland County started issuing violations to Sandy victims for septic failures that were either the result of years of decay or Sandy's storm damage. How can these poor victims pay for daily fines and fix issues when they do not even have the money to rebuild? We can always depend on the government to destroy a person further when victims are homeless due to no fault of their own. Although, I can understand that the cost benefit analysis of investing in infrastructure for ""ghost towns"" does not make economic sense, it also does not make sense that these towns were not even known by the bureaucrats when allocating funds. One has to be aware of a problem before it can be fixed.<br /><br />In summary, I found this story to be very interesting and also sad. I am amazed at the fortitude of the couple of homeowners who remain behind and did not sell out (particularly Mike and Kate).",positive
"""The Professionals"" by Owen Laukkanan will appeal to many who enjoy the suspense and crime genres.  The novel is almost exclusively plot-driven, with little or no atmosphere, characterization, or psychological insight.  However, plot drives many novels of this kind, and they are wildly popular.  I predict that this novel will find a wide audience, too.<br /><br />The story begins as four college friends, unable to find well-paying jobs, turn to low-payout, high volume kidnappings of wealthy businessmen.  The kidnappings are solely about money; no violence is ever involved.  For two years, they move from ""job"" to ""job' until one day they kidnap a repellent man with mob connections through his wife.  For the first time, their carefully planned routine goes awry.  At the same time, the law, represented by State Investigator Kirk Stevens and FBI Agent Carla Windermere, is taking an interest in this kidnapping and others that are at first seemingly unrelated.  The bulk of the book concerns the efforts of the four young people to evade both the law and the mob.<br /><br />This novel is easy to read and moves along quickly.  At 370 pages, it has 93 chapters, many only two or three pages long.  I would classify this book as escapist reading.  There are many implausible situations that will leave readers wondering how this or anything even remotely like it could have happened in the real world.  The book will not satisfy fans of authors like P. D. James, but James Patterson fans will be happy for another writer to fill their bookshelves.  The author's note suggests that the he plans more books featuring Stevens and Windermere, so perhaps their characters will be more developed in later books.  They are likable people--maybe a made-for-TV movie is in the offing?",positive

"Abigail Jones, Nabby for short, is a headstrong young woman whose sole desire is to be apprenticed to a pewterer in colonial revolutionary Boston, an ""unfit"" occupation for a young lady. Recently orphaned, Nabby is saved from becoming a seamstress's apprentice when she is hired to care for a pewterer's crippled daughter. A female answer to literature's beloved Johnny Tremain, Nabby offers a colorful commentary on colonial Boston: its crusty sailors, British soldiers, new streetlamps, and pewter shops. Although not as politically involved as Johnny Tremain, Nabby and her charge Emily play a fateful role in several important events. Pencil illustrations serve to bring Nabby's story to life. Well written, humorous, and educational, this is the female answer to the male derring-do of Johnny Tremain and all too often male protagonists of young adult colonial historical fiction. I had such fond memories of Touchmark from numerous readings in high school that I finally tracked down a used copy. If your daughter enjoys the Felicity American Girl books, she will likely enjoy Touchmark; there's even a touch of puppy love.",positive
"THE FIRE THIEF (A DARK PARADISE MYSTERY) gets so caught up in wordy descriptions of (1) Maui’s beautiful settings, and (2) Hawaii’s spiritual traditions, it is a very tedious novel to read.  The barely-there mystery plot isn’t capable of sustaining the novel.  The author has great credentials as a travel writer--so the details about the setting and people ring true--but the author lacks the storyteller’s gift.<br /><br />In the novel, a teenaged surfer’s body is found floating in a Maui cove.  It looks like a surfing accident where the surfer hit his head on undersea lava rocks.  But that doesn’t explain the shark’s tooth in his head wound, or the coroner’s finding that the surfer was dead before he went into the water.<br /><br />Detective Kali Mahoe, the police chief’s niece, must investigate and find the murderer.  Kali is on the path to becoming a spiritual leader, a kahu.  She suspects a ritual murder, in part because of recent sightings of a noppero-bo, a malicious, faceless spirit.  Kali must use both logic and her knowledge of Hawaiian legends to solve the mystery.<br /><br />This is apparently the first novel in a planned series.  It is more of a cozy mystery than a police procedural, because of its emphasis on the locale and the characters’ backgrounds and ruminations. As much as I generally enjoy both cozy mysteries and mysteries set in exotic locations (e.g., Hawaii, South Africa, Italy), I’ll be passing on the rest of this series.",negative

"First of all let me say the author does not say this will cure mental illness and it makes no disclaimer to that affect. So, to the reviewer who wrote all the blah, blah, blah get over yourself. That is basically what this book is trying to convey in a funny, quirky and lighthearted manner. I mean just look at the title and use common sense. Anyway this journal is small and that was the one negative it should be notebook size to really get the full use and this is why I deducted a star. With that being said I found this book as funny as a fart in church. If you can't laugh at that, then this book is not for you and you should probably move along and find a sense of humor.",positive

"At first I was not impressed with this book because the initial pages (up to about page 20) rambled on as sort of an advertisement as how this book would help the reader. I also had trouble understanding what he meant by conditioning until I read further.  Eventually, as I read on, it got better and better and now I love the advice within and understand why he used that word.<br /><br />I believe writing this text was incredibly cathartic for the author in addition to being filled with great advice for the reader. For instance, he had to learn to be his true self. Although, he does not specifically say when he came out as a gay man, it is obvious he was living a life that was not really his.<br /><br />He highlights many thought-provoking excerpts in this book. Here are two such thoughts:<br /><br />""It's amazing what insight comes when we stop long enough to listen and how fulfilled our path becomes when we use what we've found to live authentically.""<br /><br />""...one of life's most valuable lessons: to stop putting off till tomorrow what you have the opportunity to do today.""<br /><br />In summary, this text is food for thought and is designed to get the reader to live their life authentically, in the moment, be grateful for what one has, take care of yourself, excercise, eat right, etc., etc. Although this may seem like common sense, most of us do not follow this path because we are ""conditioned"" into being someone other than ourselves. From page 20 on, this text is a complete gem and an enjoyable read!",positive
"This is my first Julie Garwood book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a fast paced, engaging story that I didn't want to put down. The first chapter was a bit confusing to me. A lot of characters were introduced and I had to keep rereading parts to keep them all straight. But once I got into the story, I didn't have that issue any longer. There's a lot of FBI action. There were several different conflicts taking place.  It is pretty steamy at times, but that's not the main focus of the story. I started reading this one evening, but stopped after a couple of chapters. I picked it up the next day and didn't put it down until I was done. This is a great summer read!",positive

"Let it be known: I am a train nut. A VIA Rail nut, to be more specific. So when I heard about this great little mystery about a murder aboard the Canadian from Winnipeg to Vancouver, I had to read it! ""Murder on the Canadian"" was a short read, but a very enjoyable one.<br />Protagonist Tom Austen wants to become a detective like his idols the Hardy Boys. Tom knows all the techniques: fingerprinting, poisons, collecting evidence and interrogating suspects, but when his vacation turns to a real murder investigation he gets more than he bargained for.<br />The beautiful Catherine Saks has been murdered in her room, apparently by her drunk, jealous husband. There are a number of suspects, and Tom has to move quickly and carefully to avoid being caught. The case takes a number of interesting twists and turns, including Tom nearly being abandoned in a small town, a poisoned omelette, and a fight in a railway tunnel with the killer.<br />Vivid descriptions, steady pacing and plenty of great conversations, as well as several action-packed sequences make this an enjoyable read for mystery and train fans of all ages.",positive
I've been getting into graphic novels here lately and wanted to check this one out. Totally not my cup of tea. I felt it was hard to read as there being several styles and approaches when telling the stories that made following them impossible at times. Not only that but this novel contains historical facts that aren't even included in the stories but instead are given outside of them in which you need to pre-read before even reading the actual stories. Just a mess of a graphic novel that is not very good.,negative
"**I was given an advanced readers copy. All opinions expressed are my own.**.  every so often I like to mix things up a bit and read something different. I usually read cozy mysteries,and an occasional light romance....but this is not either of those! This is one that I was referring to about mixing it up, I fell in love with the characters in the first book called &#34;Red on the run&#34;. This book will keep you in suspense from the very beginning...and at times it will make your heart start pumping...( I actually found myself reading faster as the excitement was escalating,lol)..... thinking that the syndicate is fading away after 17 years,Jason is writing a book about them and the corruption they bring ,until dead bodies are being discovered and he realizes that the syndicate has never really stopped ...they just have been regrouping and are coming back even stronger...and &#34;they&#34; want control of what Jason is writing about them in his book... this is a real page turner. another great suspenseful read from a great author...I highly recommend this book as well as the first...and I cannot wait for the next one.",positive

"I just could not finish this book. That's really rare - even with the bad books, I try to sludge through and finish them. This one I finally just gave up on half way through, having decided the world would have to end or not without me.<br /><br />The dual writer format just did not mesh well in this book - they seemed to stop and start. The author's voice did not flow smoothly and I clearly felt I was hearing/reading two seperate thought patterns, it was distracting. Then there was the irregular flow to the story itself and the fact that bouncing from various perspectives was done badly. That worked brilliantly for Stephen King in ""The Stand"", but in this book every switch felt like I had missed an entire transitional paragraph making the change from one character or place to the next. Finally.... we did not need to know EVERY SINGLE TINY DETAIL about EVERY SINGLE character in the book even the minor players. Their eyebrow color, the thickness of nostril hairs, the color of the paint in a room from childhood, a pilot's personal feelings about the uniforms of the flight attendant, on and on and on and ON AND ON AND ON with trivial minutia.<br /><br />The trivial irrelevant details with no real forward movement of the end of the world plot is what finally prompted me to toss the book aside.",negative

"The year is 1822 and the three wild and beautiful Swan sisters land in the small isolated town of Sparrow, Oregon, full of hope for a new life. Roll on a year and the townspeople tie rocks around their ankles and drown them in the wicked deep claiming they are witches. Quite understandably, the town has been cursed ever since.<br /><br />Every June following their drowning, the sisters return to the town to possess the bodies of local girls in order to lure boys into the wicked deep and so to their deaths. This becomes known as ""Swan Season"" and every year tourists flock to the little town of Sparrow to witness the boy's bodies get pulled from the ocean (yes morbid tourism is actually a thing). As “Swan Season” rolls around for yet another year, our narrator, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot, wants to have no part in the festivities (if festivities is even the right word for this kind of morbid ritual). Easier said than done for Penny when a new boy arrives in town inadvertently pulling her into the darkness of the curse as she fights to keep him safe.<br /><br />The Wicked Deep is a thrilling debut novel by Shea Ernshaw, a dark tale of murder, revenge, curses, teens doing stupid stuff - and, possibly, the redeeming power of love.<br /><br />I won't say the book is without flaws, but those flaws were very few as compared to all the things I loved about it and they were certainly not significant enough for me to give it any less than five stars.",positive

I don't live in a cave - I know that's out there, but as a mom to a teenage daughter, I was hyper aware of it. For the most part,  it was entertaining and I enjoyed the fabulous trip they went on.

"The Family Upstairs is a suspenseful and fast paced story. A young woman, Libby, who was adopted as an infant,  inherits a house upon her 25th birthday. The story revolves around the happenings and mysterious circumstances that led up to the early abandonment.  The chapters are told in different perspectives, with one of them being Libby's. The other point of views are told by others who lived in the house during that time period. Part of the fun of the story is trying to figure out who those people are and what their involvement was. I did get a little confused with the jumping around. I wish the chapters listed the name of the POV or location/time period to help me keep things straight. It's not really a scary book, but I would categorize it as a suspense with some thrills. I read it from start to finish over the course of a couple of days.",positive

"This is a very interesting book about the author's experience with birds, many of which she rehabilitated or raised from fledglings. The author is also a good sketcher and sketches many of the birds she handled peppering the book with many of these delightful images. Sometimes she temporarily ""borrows"" wild birds from their nest to sketch. This is not something I agree with but this practice seems to have litte affect on the birds according to the way she justifies it.<br /><br />It is obvious that Julie has a dislike of free-roaming cats who injure birds and several of the birds she rehabilitated or attempted to rehabilitate were mauled by cats.<br /><br />She talks about phoebes, starlings, chimney swifts, a titmouse, grouse, etc., etc.  She also included a very interesting story about a turkey vulture which throws up in her car.  Apparently turkey vulture vomit is awfully fetid--not that other vomit isn't but this is worse.  I like how she ends her book with Charlie, her parrot.  I did not realize parrots were such bad pets.  She defines a pet as an animal whose emotional needs can be met by a human being and a parrot does not fit this definition according to Julie.<br /><br />Her sketches throughtout the book are wonderful and her bird stories kept my interest.  She named many of the birds and when rehabilitated always released them if they could live on their own.  Julie is definitely a ""bird mother"" and from my perspective her husband Bill is a saint to put up with it all.  Although I'm not a birder, it was great to read about Julie's experiences and I'm am thankful their exists all forms of people in this world who take care of orphaned animals avian or otherwise.",positive
"SOME CHOOSE DARKNESS is a professionally written novel, but it’s just not my cup of tea.  It’s kind of a cross between a police procedural and a cosy mystery, in that:  (1) the main investigator (Rory Moore) is an expert doll restorer (!), in addition to being a terrific forensic reconstructionist (an independent contractor?); and (2) the story depends heavily on the characters’ personalities and their inter-relationships with other people.<br /><br /> The plot is intricately pieced together out of chapters told from different characters’ viewpoints (e.g., Rory, a woman with hyperthymesia (superior memory), the perp aka “the Thief”), and from different time periods (1979, 1981-1982, and 2019).  The slow-moving chapters, packed with description, just dribble out the clues that are supposed to keep the reader reading.<br /><br />Sadly, I haven’t the patience to slog through a mystery/thriller novel that is constructed like this one.  Generally I dislike multiple-viewpoint narration--for escape reading, I prefer police procedurals with fairly straightforward investigations.  Also, I really dislike plots where the main investigator (female, of course) gets personally sucked into the crimes being investigated (against women, of course), and ultimately gets nearly killed by the main perp.  These plots always require a lot of coincidences that totally destroy my reader’s willing suspension of disbelief.",negative

"Though I prefer reading non-fiction books, this spy novel reads pretty well. It is the first in a series about a retired CIA officer, Mark Sava, who is teaching when he becomes caught up in the intrigue of a complicated plot involving the US, Iran and Azerbaijan. The main reason I was drawn to this novel is because Iran is in current day's focus, plus the US has a history of complicated undercover stuff with Iran dating back to the Arms for Hostages stuff during the Reagan Administration. So, the novel, though fictitious, seems somewhat believable, plus gives a reader thought-provoking ideas about what might take place, sort of, in the region, if not already underway. Even, independent of current events, the story held my interest and moved along pretty fast.",positive

"I am a fan of historic novels--many of them either medieval or renaissance mysteries, some other forms of historic novel.  This is one of the best series I've read yet, well-researched and so much more than just a 'murder mystery'.  They give a good appreciation of specific times and events during the later years of King Henry VIII's reign, provoking a desire to learn more about the times (even though I've read a lot about the Tudors in factual detail) -- such as a biography of Thomas Cromwell, whom I'd never thought to be interested in before, as well as the dissolution of the monasteries.  Henry, himself, is not painted in a sympathetic light in any of the novels, which I believe, for this period, is quite accurate.  As a young king, Henry was much more admirable, but became increasingly self-serving, avaricious and disinterested in his people beyond how they could contribute to his aspirations to conquer and his greed for luxury.",positive

"For an O'Reilly book, DESIGNING FOR WEARABLES: EFFECTIVE UX FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVICES seems a little short on technical content.  About half of it is a fairly comprehensive, descriptive catalog of existing wearable devices (e.g., FitBit, Jawbone, Pebble smartwatch, Google Glass, Lumo Lift, GoPro, Pokemon Go, Thync).  The remaining half is devoted to to actual designer's thinking, tools, problems, and methods (e.g., service design and machine learning, embodiment and perception, prototyping and prototyping tools, selling the invisible).<br /><br />The author points out that wearable devices offer &#34;services&#34;, so that designers must focus on UX (user experience), and create interfaces that translate the data gathered by the devices into things that are helpful and meaningful to the users.  For example, an activity tracker that records steps is a mere pedometer, unless the tracker does extras, such as tabulating the wearer's daily, weekly, and monthly activity, heart rate, calories burned, sleep time, etc.<br /><br />For a wearables designer, an important consideration is figuring out what sort of technology is available to gather the data that can be reported in ways that the user will find helpful and motivating.  For example, the Fitbit Charge HR uses a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor to measure heart activity, and a gyroscope and accelerometer to count steps.<br /><br />If you're not an actual designer, but happen to own one (or more) of these devices, it's interesting just to read up on what it's intended to do (from a designer's perspective), and how it actually works.",positive

"This was not my favorite Robert B. Parker book. For multiple reasons, this book reminded me that some times author's get too big for their proverbial britches and lose sight of catering to their fans. This book was weak. Anyone who has read the previous Parker books knows that he can write a seriously good mystery and has the ability to thrill and please his fans. This book was a pathetic excuse for a mystery. it wasn't the slightest bit mysterious. I liken this book to going to Starbuck's for a hot cup of strong coffee and getting one coffee bean that has been ground into an Olympic sized swimming pool of water. Really, the cover looked good and the jacket blurb was exciting, but as in the case of movie previews, those were the best parts.

"This book is nothing more than a bunch of big words with long winded sentences, clearly it makes the author feel important. This book teaches the reader nothing. It confuses more than educates the reader.

Please look in to other books before purchasing this one.",negative

Dr. Suess has a great way of &#34;speaking&#34; to imaginations.  Highly recommend all.<br />In this particular story, he loves to point out and spell &#34;Go&#34; and &#34;Dog&#34; and &#34;Stop&#34;.  Not to mention the story. His personal favorite because of the cars.",positive
"A nice short romance. I had trouble with the dialogue, it just never sounded natural, it never flowed. You may feel differently.

"This is a sweet collection of short essays about our former first lady. Each one is short and well written. I was able to read bits here and there over the course of few weeks.

"The Haunted Mine by Carrie Bates unfortunately has an amateurish feel to it. It felt like a student had a school assignment to come up with a Haunted story. It sadly lacked depth and had hardly any character development. It was like some kid retelling a story he or she once heard. It was on the shorter side and didn't take much time to read.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was also pretty predictable with no real twists. Adam was nice but very one dimensional. You don't really get to know him as a person at all and the only other people you hear something about are Roy and Bill, Kathy and Sarah, and none are really drained out any real depth.<br /><br />This is sadly not even a real Haunted story since those should be at least a little scary, which you're is not, not even close. I really can't recommend this book at all, it is just too simplistic in every aspect.",negative
"New to me author. The premise sounds awesome, and I read a few of the postive reviews, but the story didn't live up to the expectations. Mostly I credit that to my dislike of the protagonist. As father's day comes around his utter disregard for his father over the last 18 years not to mention his deceit towards his sister adding to my disbelief that if he could find the money then why hadn't anyone else. Take those 3 elements away and you do have a really good read.",negative
"This was a good story. There are so many suspects who could be the murderer. It's a good thing Priscilla is a vampire, or she just might be a victim.I really like how the author talks about the old mansions and businesses. Definitely recommend this book. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book.",positive
"It's painful to try and read this book, it was either written by kids or someone who doesn't speak English- those are the only explanations I can think of because the things in this are just STRANGE and not really funny. One of the annoying things it mentions is a 6 year old and a 5 year old kid of theirs kicking each other (Very specific, not relatable for most of us) In fact- most of the ""annoying"" things in this book are specific to the author of the book and the whole book isn't relateable. It's truly terrible and I don't know whether to throw it away or donate it because the thought of some poor soul spending money on it and then reading the junk makes me sad. I'll probably just toss it in the trash.",negative
Not my style. Too graphic violence,negative
"This was supposed to be about a black ops unit formed to rid the area of drugs and those who sell as payback for hurting Katherine Anderson.  Its more of a giant matchmaking scheme for Joseph.  Yes there is a unit but that action is far between the romance of Brackish/ Erin and Carl /Avery.  Two weddings, Katherine’s surgery, Joseph playing matchmaker to Brackish and Erin.  An under over FBI unit would be more appropriate.  The black ops unit is too busy romancing to be a black ops.  Glad its a KU but wont read anymore.  Still dry and slow. Definitely false advertising the military aspect.  So disappointed in this series.",negative

"This was such a good book full of twists and turns.

"First, it's SMALL.  Small pages, and not many of them.  Second, the ""song"" is very short and the pictures don't really give you any more than the words do.

"&quot;An Island Like You&quot; first came to my attention as I was searching for books by Judith Ortiz Cofer. I was drawn in by the individuality of the characters, their day to day challenges and struggles, and the strength that all characters showed in the face of the unknown. I just received &quot;Una isla como tu&quot; last week after deciding that I wanted to read the book in the true language of the characters, and I wasn't disappointed by the translation.<br />The Spanish novel is every bit as compelling and graceful as its English counterpart, and great care is taken not to change any of the details. I believe that reading this novel in Spanish makes these stories of the barrio even more authentic, and this is an excellent translation that shouldn't be missed. The reading level of Spanish should be accessible to high school and university students studying Spanish.",positive

"I purchased the book for my college bound nephew who is a huge jello fan, as part of his Christmas bag.  He is quite good at inventing his own jello creations, but I thought he might like this for inspiration.  It's a lovely hardcover book with nice color pics.  He's going to love it. Only thing that would make it 5 stars would be a spiral back so that it stays open when you're using it.  Just a personal preference.",positive
The book reads more like it was intended for a teen audience. Kinda silly and unnecessary shock value that really does nothing.,negative
"I think our kids have all aged out of this book (sixth grade and above,) but this would be a perfect book for first through fourth graders, especially anyone that is dreading or thinking about the first day of school.  The humor is clean and young and the stories are straightforward and great for these early readers.  I really wish that we had this when we had some second graders in the house.<br /><br />The art is nice and colorful.  I can't say that I love this book, but those of us who read it liked it, just felt that it was for younger kids.",positive

"It is definitely not a watercolor book.  The paper bucked completely.  The pages honestly appear to be photo copies of other pictures. I say that bc if you look at the seal pics you can see the tell tale line at the bottom of the page.  As someone who has made many photocopies of pages in my time so I could try out different colors & mediums that black line is a dead giveaway to me. It’s on other pages too.  The entire book just seems off. Nothing is sharp & clear. There is what looks like toner dust on all the pages making them look muddy.  There are no sharp lines & there is no clear definition.  At least there isn’t in my copy.  And the Coloring Book for Adult on the bottom of the front cover annoys me. Why is it singular & not plural?  They usually say coloring book for kids or coloring book for kids & adults or coloring book for adults- plural.  Lol  Plus it would work for kids if you can get over the grey scale nature of it.  Personally I’m not going to waste expensive pens & paints trying to paint over the grey & black mess.  I grew up in SW Florida minutes from the beaches & I was really excited about the sea life in this. I hope the printers & designers figure out how to clean up the mess bc some of the designs are really cute. They just aren’t worth my time to hand trace & transfer them, but I’m sure there are ppl that will be up to the challenge.  This is one is a hard no. Going back. I tried.",negative
"I find this book pretty useless. For example, I wanted to get a look at Chugiak, which is 21 miles northeast along the Eagle River from Anchorage. It isn't even listed in this book. I wanted a good map of Anchorage and the outlying areas, like Chugiak, the only map is on the inside cover and it's glued to the spine so impossible to lay flat or mark in any way. The is Alaska by dummies if you ask me.",negative
"If you like literary mysteries that focus on characterization, rather than on the step-by-step solving of a murder, then you may enjoy A WELCOME MURDER.  However, this novel just isn’t my type of mystery-thriller.<br /><br />The murder victim (Rayce) is a despicable person whose death is welcomed by all who knew him.  But all five of the still-alive characters (Johnny, Sheriff Fran, Allison, Smoochie, Dena) are unpleasant people.  The story is told through the first-person accounts of these nasty folks (rotating chapters), and they aren’t people that I want to know anything about.<br /><br />The characters’ individual stories are deftly layered together, so that the “reveal” of the murderer is plausible enough.  However, the underlying plot isn’t that interesting, because I never cared what happened to Johnny or to any of the others.  I guess that Johnny’s terrifying, white supremacist, former prison cellmate is supposed to inject a comic element.<br /><br />I think that Steubenville, Ohio is probably a much nicer town than the one in the novel, which is a town that anyone living there should probably want to leave.",negative
"From a dirty cop and Hispanic drug dealers to an incredibly quick switch to a supernatural thriller under the full moon (if you get my drift) to. . . The end. There's no resolution, no closure or solution. The book just ends.<br />It's not badly written except for all the dialog being tabbed in and begun with a tilde (~) and never put in quotes. I've never seen this before and I've read thousands of books. A quick few searches turned up no evidence of the tilde being used this way. Other than that oddity it wasn't a bad novella, I'd more call it an idea that never fully panned out. I didn't hate it but I don't really recommend it nor would I read it again. I would, however, give the author another try if he's written/writes anything else.",negative
"I had high hopes for a fun, thrilling read. I found it rather tedious, and unfortunately underwhelming. The front end of the story was lacking in detail and development. I failed to feel building suspense. The back end of the story moved along, but was rushed in a manner that I never bought into any of it. I look for stories of this ilk to provide me with an immersive experience. With this I was waiting to be invited into the story but instead watched it flutter by.  Perhaps more history, more detail of every character, and more development (including back story) of the relationships. There were nuggets of interesting events, some really potentially wonderfully weird happenings, but it just didn't gel for me. The Ritual may provide a wonderful experience for you, but for me, the greatest pleasure was finishing/being done with it.",negative

"I have been waiting on this for weeks.  This was my favorite show as a kid and I even dressed up like Sophia for Halloween one year. I also have several kits like this from the same designer.  Every other kit contains a separate book, yarn,  notions,  and a hook within a large box.  This is what I was expecting.<br /><br />I am so disappointed that I am literally crying.  First off, the yarn is crap, but that's not a huge deal because I bought this mainly for the book.  However,  the stupid box is attached to the book!  It's not stuck to the back with annoying glue boogers ; it's smack dab in the middle of this big hardback book.  It's the stupidest thing I have ever seen.  To make matters worse,  the box is damaged and opened.  The yarn is incomplete and this book will be garbage soon because there is an empty flimsy box in the middle.  I hate this and I want a refund!",negative
"Just finished reading this book last night, long after I should have been asleep - it was a fascinating story of the Oaks first 30 years.  Now it's time for another one about the last 10 years!  They're a fantastic and devoted group of men, not to mention that they can sing their hearts out in an incredible performance, even in a not-too-big town like Prescott AZ, where I had a front-row seat for their most recent concert here earlier this year!!!",positive
"This book is poorly written. The author takes much time setting up scenarios and building characters only to have them fizzle out in the most uninteresting ways. Boring. The author gives you all this build up, and then there is this dud of a climax that leaves you thinking, ""This is it?"" The book is a giant bore.<br />I also did not appreciate the author's tone toward the former president. I mean, that in and of itself dated the book. I also did not appreciate the semi-spiritual but agnostic tone of the book. It was anti-Christian, which I do not like.<br />For parents: The book has no foul language. There are a few references to sex, but nothing in detail. It is anti-Christian and agnostic in its tone.",negative

"This novel was all over the place. I'll try to give you the gist of the story spoiler free.<br /><br />Rowan Van Zandt tells the story of his family. They live in a land of noir. He and his twin brother have no future after getting in trouble. His father had a nowhere job until an altercation at work put an end to even that. His mother, Umma, grabs at a lifeline for the family, testing a spaceship in Florida with another family. That does not end well either, resulting in Rowan on the run out west. Lots of macabre humor make this one interesting read, it just got to be a bit much for my continued enjoyment.",negative
"This series is such a great read. Each book in the series focuses on one main Thorne sister. I love how the other members are included without going overboard with same details from the previous book. This one is about Autumn, and her relationship with what happened 9 years ago between her and the love of her life Keaten. There are so many aspects of book that I love. The characters are so well written and described, that you can ""feel"" what you are reading . This smart author leaves you wanting more with her endings as well !  I would suggest that you buy all of the books before you start reading because,once you start,you won't want to stop to wait for the next one !",positive
"These cards may seem great at face value with its color reflective properties and all but they are really not. You cannot shuffle these like most tarot card decks. These are super delicate and almost seem like they are used for pretty show or display only. They also possess a very bad vibe & energy to them upon using them and sent them back. I even met Grace in person after the fact, and she was not a kind person at all. She is even not a part of the spiritual community. She admitted she only got into tarot cards and astrology as a bigger & better opportunity for her graphics art and app business. So there are far way better tarot card decks that you can actually shuffle and use than this one, and one with good intentions as well. This deck is just for clout and only for one person's selfish agenda.",negative

"I love Kristan Higgins books and this one did not disappoint. Let me start by saying that I read for fun. I want to be entertained. I am not nit picky about the depth of characters or details about the plot. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it started out slowly. But after the first few chapters it does pick up and I had difficulties putting it down. I stayed up late just to finish it. I found the characters to be likeable. That's important to me. The chapters alternate between the two sisters' point of views. I started out liking Jenny better than Rachel, but by the end, I grew to like Rachel, too. I follow the author on FB and the book sounds just like her! Higgins is quirky and funny and so was this book. Yes, there's a little bit of language, but it's not excessive by any means. I think it just makes it more realistic. Both sisters go through some personal growth and I was happy for them both in the end. I purchased this book months ago and I am sorry that it took me so long to find the time to read it.",positive
"I am reading this book for a book club, and if it were not for the upcoming discussion, I would not have read it.  I found the premise--historical fiction about the crusades, interesting, and I thought a woman as lead character would be a welcome change.  However, the writing is repetitive and the pacing of the novel is slow.  A good editor could have cut about 200 of its 500+ pages without sacrificing anything essential.  Something else that would have helped is a comprehensive list of characters and a brief description of each, and a set of maps of places mentioned in the novel.  Especially at the beginning, I found myself in need of both.  In short, this novel was a tough slog, and I recommend it only for fans of Anne Perry's writing.  We have two of those in our club, and they liked the book very much.",negative

I made the beef stew first and it was a tremendous hit with my family. Bravo Gabriele! You outdid yourself with this cookbook and I can't wait until the next one comes out!!!!",positive
"No. There is some helpful info to be gleaned from this book, but it lacks substance. This is more of a recipe book, and one without pictures. There aren't pictures! well, maybe 3-4. Not enough to be helpful. I want to see what the recipe looks like finished, and when it comes to individual items being dehydrated--if this is meant to be a learning source-- then why does it not have pictures of what much of this is referring to. So I would say, not for newbies.<br /><br />There is a page on best/safe practices. There is about 14 pages all told on the ""101"" of dehydrating.<br /><br />Had I been in a bookstore, I would have picked this up for the title, and then would have set it right back down once I flipped through it. I dont feel better informed after having read through this. Blegh,",negative

"Where do I begin?  I suppose with one star for a mere attempt of writing a novel !!  Unfortunately, I sent this book in hardcopy to a friend for her birthday. I also downloaded it on my Kindle so that we could read it together and discuss it when completed.  Midway, I texted my friend to apologize for the upsetting content of child abuse among the dominate three characters. (in three days, she still has not responded). Except for nutrition-starvation, the mention of all other forms of child abuse was dominant and described in almost every chapter. I do not find pedophilia entertaining ! A rape of a nine-year-old???? Seriously?? Nor is reading of severe physical abuse entertaining.  I was misled by the description of the plot...an adult medical doctor in search of her missing sister.  I stayed with it until the end because I kept looking for some redeeming shred. I will never gift someone a book ever again that I've not read myself !!  My friend is going through a difficult emotional time with dialysis and has always wanted a sister.  I thought this sister-to-sister tale of loss and forgiveness would be a pleasant read for her.  I was dead wrong.  Barbara O'Neal must be one twisted person to think that the contents of this novel would be entertaining.

"the barbarian in the tale is poorly defined and even when the story looked over his shoulder with him as the focal character.  he also despite being a barbarian who hates magic and yet has travelled to a magical school to try to control his uncontrollable magic, is just bland.<br /><br />The story does telegraph the fact that sex is going to be a huge part of the tale.  I have no major problem with the sex, but I still want a more fleshed out tale with a plot that draws me in.  This one somehow managed to repel me.<br /><br />Its mostly the same issue I have with too many ""harem"" tales.  The girls are more a collection of body parts and hormones than fleshed out characters.<br /><br />I can't say much more.  It was just disappointing overall.  It's definitely a product of the genre, but sadly, that means little in a genre that often fails to tell good tales.",negative

The few more or less moral issues that come up are not examined in any depth and certainly not resolved.  Of course, you would not really EXPECT a sci fi writer to have philosophy chops, but the author would have done better to stick to a more science and thriller theme and left the highbrow stuff alone.<br />The end result is failure on all fronts.

"I purchased both the ([[ASIN:0981994644 More Chat Pack Cards: New Questions to Spark Fun Conversations]] and the [[ASIN:0975580167 Chat Pack: Fun Questions to Spark Conversations]] (this set)  to add variety to my vacation time with my boyfriend. Both he and I liked how these cards stimulated conversations and allowed us to think and get to know details about each other that we did not know even though we have been together for 15 years.<br /><br />Each card is the size of a tiny Post-It note at 1 inch x 3-1/2 inches. In this package are questions such as:<br /><br />- Thinking back to all the great TV series finales that you have seen over the years, which show do you believe had the best final episode?<br />- If snow could fall in any flavor, what flavor would you choose?<br />- Which age, when you turned it, was the most difficult for you to accept?<br /><br />Some questions made us think on the fly and make stuff up. This means that if we were answering this question again, we would give a different answer because we never actually thought about that particular question. There are some questions that were difficult to answer. For instance, I do not watch TV or movies much so I could not answer any questions related to the best movie sequel because I did not know any. One is encouraged to change up the questions if necessary.<br /><br />Overall, we found this both fun and entertaining and only got though part of each pack.

"These ""successor"" novels are rarely at the level of the originals, but even with that lowered expectation, this is a sorry excuse for a detective story.  Rex Stout might come back from the dead to chastise this author.<br /><br />The writing is ok, but ham-handed and repetitive in its effort to use some of the amusing themes in the Nero Wolfe books: especially Wolfe's fondness for precision in language and Archie's insouciant (and sometimes sardonic) humor. The whole felt trying-too-hard and artificial, not at all like the Stout books.<br /><br />And then the plot.  Apparently the author had nary a decent idea about a murder plot, so it was this: ""man falls out of window, there are many suspects with weak motives, under mild pressure one of them runs away revealing his guilt"". Um. And all the while we're being bludgeoned with the idea that Wolfe is a genius, although there's scant evidence of that in this book.<br /><br />I haven't mentioned the sloppy writing, assuming that it mostly reflects the pre-publication nature of my copy.  But some of the lines made me cringe, I wonder how they'll improve those sufficiently.<br /><br />Anyway, avoid.  If you like this stuff, there are many fine authentic Nero Wolfe stories, and most of them are delightful.",negative
Much better than book one. I wasn't sure if i would like this series but it is surprisingly good.

Written very well.<br />I recommend and plan to continue with book three.,positive
"This book is a must for those of us who spent our formative years in Southern California!  I was born in 1945, and spent the first 20 - 30 years of my life in and around the San Gabriel Valley, so I recognize and remember so clearly huge portions of this book.  In fact, my father was a Helmsman for a few years when I was pre-school age and I can remember when he took me along on his route now and then, and how excited I was when he let me blow that famous whistle!  I've only read the first 35 pages or so (I want to savor it, slowly!) and dozens of the pictures have brought back treasured memories; some from my childhood and many from my adult years.  The Rose Parade, Pacific Ocean Park, Lake Arrowhead Village, Chinatown, Clifton's Cafeteria, Knott's Berry Farm, and of course, Disneyland!  My family went to Disneyland the first week it opened in 1955, and I've been back a number of times, although it's changed more than I like.  Progress, I suppose, but that's another story.  I'd love to share this book with friends, but I'd be afraid it would never come back, so I'll just tell them where they can buy their own copy.  I can absolutely guarantee they'll love it as much as I do!!",positive
"Rebecca is a newer historical American Girl character that I was unfamiliar with. The book is set in New York in 1914. It is about a Jewish immigrant family who is trying to raise money for their Russian relatives to immigrate to the United States. The story is engaging as well as entertaining. There's a glossary in the back to help with the Jewish and Russian vocabulary. There's also a section in the back called ""Inside Rebecca's World"" which gives some more historical information about that time period. Immigration is a current topic in our country and I think it's important to have some understanding about what immigrants go through in order to have a better life in our country.",positive
book was disappointing,negative
"I have read all of Ms. Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed them. But this one, I couldn't get through. Barr is an excellent writer, but this topic, and it's darkness, is not what I want to read about. I have heard Ms. Barr speak. She has a wonderful sense of humor, is an excellent speaker and had the audience in the palm of her hand. As others have said, please get back to the Anna Pigeon we know and love.",negative
"Really more of a string of connected vignettes than a novel, I was numb and bored by page 50. Again and again the poverty, the hopelessness and downright cruel meanness of the characters lives was like being beaten with a filthy pipe. Strangely, the descriptions could be by turns beautiful and touching, but the repetition was too much. This book just didn’t click with me.",negative
"Illustrative context made the flow and readability hard to follow and the legibility for me to see was poor. I bought two copies. one for me and one to gift. The person I gifted also felt it eas hard to read and follow. Something that a teen may have done in colored pens for themselves, but poor overall for mass market execpt to trend sell.  Sorry I wasted my money....",negative
"These were wet and smelly with some type of chemical.  They were in individual plastic bags which were sealed. The pillow cases were actually wet inside the packages and had a chemical odor. The outside packaging was dry.<br />I washed them by hand 5 times and each time the water was full of dye.  I've soaked them in vinegar and letting them air dry outside.<br />Even if they are alright now, I'd never use them indoors due to the unknown chemical.<br />Good chance I'll be returning these.",negative
Cute book,positive
"Obviously a talented author but I had to give up on it after the dog scene. Such vile images and such abuse of animals and women. Depressing and pointless. I can read the news for free and get the same feeling. The book I bought before this was so dull, and also depressing, I couldn't tolerate that either. Where is all the decent new literature that won't either bore you to death or give you nightmares?",negative
"My husband is a type 2 diabetic and we wanted to explore the vegan diet option to help... First I will say that this cookbook has NO photos.  I am always a little disappointed by this, but seems like more and more cookbooks these days are photo-less.  :(  On the upside, there is a very good informational (in my opinion as a vegan newbee) forward in this book with useful info about substitutes and options... The recipes seem to be fairly straightforward (no culinary degree needed or super special equipment) and tasty.  I really love the chilled watermelon soup - it's more delicious than one might think. Wish the book had photos and a spiral back to help keep it open while in use, but even without that I think this cookbook is worth owning if you are interested in trying the vegan lifestyle.",positive

"I got the First book as a gift, this swedish writer is so gifted, I could not lay the book down. I also had to buy book two and three, I love this series, you transfered in to the world of Germanic tribes and their customs, in the 1100 century and you get to go all the way to Jerusalem with the crusade, it has so many stories, about love and dead and war, I have to admire this writer. I read a lot but he must rank after 60 years of reading book in the top ten of writers. Excellent",positive
"Might have made a good short story, but way too long and boring. Still have no idea who Veronica is, how she supports herself, or even how old she is. All i know is she writes books she never publishes, used to attempt acting, and for a so-called amateur sleuth, she is clueless. And who in their right mind has ever used Ipecac to STOP vomiting??? This is the last book of Ms Manolakas's for me. Wasn't impressed with Lethal Lawyers either. Just hoped this one would be better. Unfotunately it was worse.<br />SPOILER ALERT: The tea plus the rat poison that kept showing up? Figured that out the first time it happened.",negative
"This is a very warped story about the author/Brenner having sex with a dolphin.  Yes, a DOLPHIN.  He has an &#34;intimate relationship&#34; with the dolphin...in every sense of the word &#34;intimate&#34;.<br /><br />Loving anything or anyone is different than having sex with the object of your emotion.  And having sex with animals just doesn't fit into the description of a &#34;relationship&#34;.  Just like having sex with kids, doesn't fit into the description of a &#34;relationship&#34;<br /><br />The author here writes a &#34;novel&#34; about his REAL love and sex with a dolphin.  In his twisted mind, the dolphin and he had a romantic relationship.  Yes, they shared love, attraction, and mutually consentual sexual gratification.<br /><br />This is more than the author wants to tell you about the book, and probably more than you need to know about this book.<br /><br />Take a big pass on this walk down a very warped path.<br /><br />However if you are into having sex with animals, you're gonna love this book.",negative
"As a big fan of 2019's Daisy Jones & The Six, I've been looking forward to Taylor Jenkins Reid's follow-up.  2021's Malibu Rising is a worthy next step, although I still give Daisy the nod.  Dense, cross-generational plotline and both in-the-moment and flashback-style storytelling technique seems very filmic -- not a criticism as it works very well.  Read almost like a screenplay, I found myself casting the film in my mind as I pushed on through.  After a bit of a slow start, I felt rewarded as I stuck with it and the pace picked up nicely.  The storytelling is strong throughout, the characters nicely drawn, and the ongoing action -- past and present -- true-to-life believable.  If, like me, you found yourself hooked on Daisy & The Six, I think you'll find Malibu Rising a most worthy follow-up novel.",positive

If you are just looking into options, this book is great place to start.  I loved that it was really easy to read - not a lot of excess - just down flat info.  Even though I don't think this is a road we are going to go, it was well worth the investment to look into the options.",positive
"This book has become one of my all time favorites.  I have read it over and over throughout the last 30 years.  It really fires your imagination thinking through the changes in times, and the relationships back and forth.  Imagine yourself going back 100 years and living with your 20th century knowledge, likewise imagine yourself coming forward those 100 years.  How does one survive the tremendous changes on both ends.  I just love to consider all these things.  I wish this book was on Kindle so it would be preserved forever.  Try it, you'll love it.

I figured it out right away, however, as the road between Puerto Penasco and Golfo de Santa Clara is missing. :-( I like the look of it and the paper is sturdy and tear proof, but it's in dire need of an update. As it is, it's not really worth it.",negative
Great book to read to and with your kids about compound words. And it encourages kids to make up their own compound words. A great read!,positive
"This story seems to have a premise that the author believed in.  Its not poorly written, although I think the MC was not relatable in any way.<br /><br />But its also about a strange female dominated world where men are kept in chains (in more ways than just physical) and with some strange fetishes that definitely weren't for me.<br /><br />I just couldn't really wrap my head around the premise for the world itself.  I could see the world building, and it was more solid than most I come across recently, but it was a world that my mind rejected quickly.  Unfortunately if you reject the world building, the rest of the story tends to fall flat, and that happened here.  With the foundation of the story not to my liking, I couldn't find the entertainment.<br /><br />Others will like the matriarchal society with the strange enforcement and history, but it wasn't for me and sadly, that leaves me giving the tale just 2 stars.  I find that I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.",negative

"This is a wonderfully illustrated book with a nice story concept.  We read it to a couple of nieces and they caught on to the fact that a story was going on behind the backs of the books characters and looking quickly at each page to see what new details they were missing.  It is a nice little deconstruction of a picture book.  Probably not a book to reread over and over, but a wonderfully cute book to go through.",positive
"MAKE IT, WEAR IT: WEARABLE ELECTRONICS FOR MAKERS, CRAFTERS, AND COSPLAYERS is more valuable for the general ideas than for the specific clothing design projects.  You have to download a lot of cutting patterns (e.g., for T-shirt, skirt), 3D printer files (e.g, battery holder from Thingiverse), and how-to videos (e.g., soldering techniques) to be able to make the illuminated fashions as described.  You will also need to order specific circuit boards, fiber-optic parts, conductive thread, etc.<br /><br />Although instructions for procedures like soldering and sewing are fairly general, there are more detailed directions for unusual procedures like 3D printing directly on fabric.  (You print a few layers of your 3D embellishments before you lay the fabric onto the printing bed and secure it.)  You will need access to a 3D printer or a laser cutter for most of the projects.<br /><br />The projects are as follows:  3D Embellished T-Shirt; Fiber-Optic Fabric Scarf; Fun Festival Hip Pack; Solar Backpack; Starlight Skirt; Programmable Sewn Circuit Cuff; and LED Matrix Purse.  Using them as inspiration, you can go on to make your own fabulous lighted-up costumes and fashion garments.",positive

"I didn't find any real meat here, if you know what I mean. For a book about being deeper, it was all pretty shallow and not all that helpful. I was hoping for some solid perspective shifting. Perhaps in a small group setting, the conversations this prompts could be more perspective changing and help shift that &#34;not good enough&#34; mentality, but by itself, it wasn't all that helpful. I mean, there just wasn't anything here that HELPED. Not that it was wrong or bad, it just wasn't helpful in an adult 30 something trying to find the balance between cultural pressure and real life. It was the things we say, but don't really take to heart all that much. Those things we tell tweens. &#34;It is what is inside that counts.&#34; Yeah, we all know that and have known for a long time and it doesn't HELP. I'm not saying the book is bad or wrong. It just didn't go deep enough into the subject to be of any help to me.",positive

I highly recommend this series be read in order because each book continues the story so well.. each book adds to the fun.",positive
"Not thrilled with this calendar. The paper is thin & cheap and the colors are cheesy. The best picture is the one advertised. It's the one from Nov and also used on the cover. And with good reason. I cut it out after November was over and stapled it over Dec.<br /><br />Not sure who all gave this the rave reviews, but I cannot concur.",negative
"I have a big pet peeve against books that end in cliffhangers. If I invest in reading a book, it needs to have a good ending, which this doesn't. I was not impressed by the character either. She just seemed to make silly decisions. Other books in this series have been great, but I was sorely disappointed in this book.",negative
Not very useful unless one applies GREAT imagination.,negative
I grew up in Carmel and thought this would be a fun trip down memory lane. The focus is primarily the beginning of Carmel and life around the late 1800s to early 1900s. The pictures were fun to look through. I grew up the 70's and would have liked to have seen more from that era. There were definitely some omissions that I felt were important to old Carmel. I do think this is a fun series of books.,positive

It seems like Foster is just coasting on his laurels here.  This is the only one of the books in the sequence that I own that I haven't felt any desire to reread.  He started out with a bang but he's been going downhill as he nears what is hopefully the end of the sequence.,negative

"The writing was TERRIBLE. The author may have had a great plot in mind, but the nonsensical metaphors and cheesy overkill with bizarre adjectives made it impossible to persevere through to find it.

"""Beast"" is an exotic, creative interpretation of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The tale begins in Persia, and our hero Prince Orasmyn has been cursed by a parsi--a fairy--for sacrificing a camel that had been defiled. Turned into a lion, he is told that his father will kill him the next day, and that the only thing that can break the curse is the love of a woman. He flees his palaces and gardens, journeying to India and eventually to France.<br />The rest of the tale follows the original fairytale closely, taking place in the French countryside, with gardens full of roses. But the thing that makes Napoli's version so different and such a delight is her ability to describe the exotic sights, sounds, colours, smells and tastes of Persia, the numerous Arabic and Farsi words sprinkled throughout the text, quotes from Sufi mystics and the Quaran, and Orasmyn's observations on the countries he travels through and life as a lion. This is my favourite retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast"" along with Robin McKinley's version.",positive
"This book was so sad. The ending was a little vague, which I understand, but a little frustrating too. It's not a ""happy ending"" kind of story. It's a bit repetitive but considering the subject it's totally understandable.<br /><br />The last part was exhausting but the book was a pleasant read.",positive
"Didion's book is about one person's disjointed feelings regarding the death of her husband and sickness of her child within days of each other.  It offers a good look into the confused state of the grieving person.  In fact it was so good at conveying this haphazard state of mind that I was at times confused reading the book. I rated this book 4 stars instead of 5 because of this.<br /><br />I appreciate how hard it must have been for the author to write this book, although it probably also served some therapeutic value to her as well.<br /><br />Another good book on death is ""Chasing Daylight.""  It is more a book about life than death.  This book deals with the author's approach to putting closure on his life three months before his death",positive
"If an artsy representation of nature in embroidered forms is your thing, and you have every other possible embroidery publication, buy this one--but only if you want a complete literature on the subject.

"I love DK books. This one is full of interesting and unfamiliar (at least to me) information. Presentation is beautiful as most DK books. Each page is a different date, starting with January 1st. I used to be a classroom teacher and I would share interesting facts about ""this day in history"" with my students daily. I found this book to be somewhat lacking in some of the super fascinating facts out there that would appeal to kids. There were some things in it that would appeal to them, but a lot of the facts didn't even interest me very much. It could be that I haven't read enough of the pages yet. I have been reading them daily since getting this book. I have also skimmed through most of it as well, but I didn't read each page thoroughly yet so I could continue with my daily read. Each day only includes one ""born this day"" feature. I would be interested in seeing more of those.  I did appreciate the inclusion of a lot of black history facts which have often been left out of education.",positive

"Shadow Kiss is the third in the Vampire Academy series that focuses on Rose Hathaway, future guardian to Lissa, the last in a line of Dragomir royalty. Rose is dhampir, the offspring of a human and vampire. Lissa is Moroi, a mortal vampire with magical powers (the Strigoi are evil immortal vampires that kill to survive).  Rose is Lissa's Guardian, sworn to protect her at any cost. Her wants and needs come second to Lissa's. Rose and Lissa have been best friends since childhood, and she'd never questioned the cost of giving up her personal life to protect Lissa, but now she's haunted by a growing sense of resentment. After the death of a friend, Rose is troubled by dark thoughts and impulses and her crush on the handsome teacher Dimitri spirals out of control.<br /><br />I hadn't read any of the previous novels in the series before picking up Shadow Kiss, but even so, Mead makes the backstory accessible to new readers. Rose is a captivating narrator, strong-willed and impulsive. Her blossoming relationship with Dimitri is handled tactfully, and provides a sweet counterpoint to the violence that is unleashed upon St. Vladimir's. In many ways, St. Vladimir's presents all of the typical high school drama: cliques, catty remarks, annoying teachers, drunken parties, but with the element of magic and vampiric royalty. It's much more three-dimensional than some other recent vampire young adult fiction. The story is gripping and kept me reading until the last heart-wrenching page, and I rushed out to discover the continuing story in [[ASIN:1595141987 Blood Promise (Vampire Academy, Book 4)]].",positive

"Wasn't what I thought it would be according to the reviews I read Online.  The &#34;F-Bomb&#34; was used in this novel of trashy people. Kids will be kids, but the prank that was pulled in this novel, on a Halloween night, made me very glad that I was raised in the slums where blue-collar people taught their children to respect others. People were factory workers, but they never talked like the people in this trashy novel !! It was an Melting-Pot neighborhood of immigrants who took pride in themselves and their behavior. I may have been of the lower socioeconomic class, but the young guys I knew and hung out with were fine kids.<br />  The &#34;hit-jobs&#34; later in the novel took the cake.  I struggled to finish the book because my hard earned money was in it. This writer will never get another penny out of me.  When I lived in England later in life, I came to know the British and Irish and I can tell you that I met no one who read this kind of trash or COULD write this trash. They were people of integrity, honesty and pride.  I NEVER heard the F-bomb used, EVER the entire time I lived there.  Duclan Huges must be a different breed altogether.  What trash this is.  Trashy people making trashy choices ....if this is status quo to you, then read it.  It certainly isn't my kind of mystery novel, for sure.",negative

"Ostwald obviously was upset that Gould turned away from him.  This biography is nothing but a shrinks' analysis after being cast aside and feeling hurt.  Compared to other biographies, you can tell that after Ostwald was dumped he has no solid facts about Gould.  And much of what he writes is contradicted by other biographers who were working with Gould's close friends, letters, and other documents.<br />This book is a sham, written by a self-absorbed psychiatrist who wanted to make a buck off of his one-time (and short) association with someone famous. Avoid.<br />If you want an accurate, reliable, well-researched, and very FAIR account of Glenn Gould's life, consider the one written by Kevin Bazzana: &#34;Wondrous Strange: The Life and Art of Glenn Gould.&#34;",negative

"Prior to reading this, I was unfamiliar with the deadly London fog or Reg Christie. I read The Devil in the White City many years ago and loved it, so since this was compared to it, I wanted to give it a try. The subject was interesting and well researched. It was a bit slow and choppy at times. I felt that it jumped around a lot to the point that it confused me every now and then. It didn't have the flow that The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson. I don't usually read nonfiction books, but Larson's book read like a novel. I didn't feel that I was reading nonfiction. This one didn't read as easily. There were a few times where it resembled fiction, but most of the time it felt like I was reading something for school. Overall, I did like it. It was informative and interesting.",positive
"A very dear friend of mine gave me a copy of Roberto Innocenti's lavishly illustrated take on Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" A holiday classic in its own right (check out the wonderful 1938 cinematic adaptation starring Reginald Owen, newly released on DVD for the first time), Innocenti's incredibly detailed watercolours bring Dickens' London to life: we peer through windows to see mothers caring for sick children, see delights piled up in shop windows, and small details that give depth to the story (the Dutch-tiled fireplace in Scrooge's home, the Cratchit threadbare hovel). The paper stock is very good quality, as is the ink. A worthwhile investment for children old enough to appreciate this timeless tale, sure to become a treasured symbol of Christmas.",positive

"While the Amazon title doesn't promise this, the cover of the book says these are reusable stickers.<br /><br />Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store because I suggested another reusable sticker book (our son loves the Melissa and Doug Reusable Sticker Book). These stickers are only reusable in the sense that they don't stick well the first time, so you can pull them up and relay them once or twice more. After that, they loose all stickiness.<br /><br />So beyond the fact that it isn't reusable at all, I also feel like she got ripped off. Had there been more stickers maybe it wouldn't have been so bad But $6 for 75 non-sticky stickers feels like a waste of money to me. There are only 4 pages of stickers and about 6 scenes.<br /><br />Go for any one of the M&D versions, it's the same price.<br /><br />If you're looking for just stickers, I would recommend the ""THOMAS' STICKER EXPRESS (Thomas & Friends) (Super Stickerific) [Paperback]"" with over 700 stickers!  Slightly more expensive, but totally worth it.  Hopefully your kid is a train lover.  If not, I'm not sure if Golden Book makes another 700+ themed sticker book like this, but I sure hope so!",negative

Both him and his 3 yr old sister enjoyed this book being read to them.

"Don't want to include any spoilers, but there's a death early in the book, which is the mystery, so I guess any reader would expect a death. The BIG problem was the cause of death, and how even the police who investigate rule the death a suicide. I stopped reading the book at that point.<br />Then I was traveling and this was about the only thing to read, so I continued. Later in the book, the author ramps up the tension when a woman goes missing. Her friends get all concerned about her and call her several times. Uhhh, wouldn't someone think of going to her home to see if she's okay? Guess not. It felt like the author just needed to add some action and stuck this in.",negative

In the end we made a Asparagus Risotto because we had everything we needed on hand.  But even that we ended up googling so we had an image to aim for.<br /><br />The book appears to have a lot of good ideas and I'm sure we will put some into our normal rotation as they seem simple yet different.

purchased this and some others with colored pencils and pens for my (adult) daughter when she was recovering from a illness... she was thrilled.  She reports that it is relaxing... soothing... and chases the blues right away. Who would have known?  Anyway... she loved coloring as a child.. and apparently it's not such a bad thing to revert to some &#34;childish&#34; things once in a while... :),positive

"Maybe it is just me, but I did find this book to be a tough read abd it did not go smoothly. I likle the basic ideas and priciples but wish it could have been more easy read/user friendly.",negative
"This was an interesting book although not going to be a family classic.  The poetry was ok, as was the story.  Straightforward, uncomplicated and not overly literary.  It is a quick read and although I did not find it to be the best, I do think this would make an absolutely wonderful intro to poetry writing.  Each poem has a title and a subtitle that tells you what kind of poetry is being used in the poem.  You can then reference the back which tells more about the type of poetry.  I think it would be an invaluable reference for early year poetry classes.<br /><br />The art is cartoony and good and supports the narrative poetry.  All in all a decent book, but not great.",positive
"I spent several years as a teenager living in La Jolla back in about 1958 - 61 (?) so I'm enjoying the book tremendously!  I plan to share it with my younger sister when I'm done because she'll get a kick out of it, too!",positive
"Intense, involving, and very personal, Patrick Callahan's Decades of Deception reads like a crisp, well-written screenplay.  I read it in one day, two sittings.  It's just that gripping.  The plot centers on a twisted bit of family history that rocks a young family man's world and follows him through his dogged journey to get to the truth of it all.  What's especially interesting is that he's just an average everyman caught up in an unusually shocking and troubling dilemma; so, although it's a strange situation, most of us can relate because of his humanity.  Recommended to fans of mystery -- real-life and fictional.  You'll also have a bit of fun casting the imaginary movie adaptation in your mind's eye.",positive
"I've been reading this to my boys.  I started it when we visited Canada and rode the train.  We're not finished yet, that is with the book, but honestly I'm not sure we ever will be.  It's a slow starter, difficult to understand, even a little difficult to read with fluency because the language is poor.  The story may end up being a reasonably good one after we get past the first third, but already the author's skill is quite apparently lacking.  It may very well be a bestseller in the here-today, gone-tomorrow market, but it hardly compares to great children's literature.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />It took us a while, but we did finish it.  The story picked up a bit about half-way through, but it also continued to demand further stretches of the reader's credulity.  While I didn't find anything offensive, the story just alternated between boring and uninspiring.  It wasn't the worst thing I've read at all.  I'd liken it to a popular action movie -- shallow and unbelievable, but entertaining enough to sell widely.<br /><br />I'd just switched to Boundless after reading a string of Newberry honor books and the original, uncensored Hardy Boys.  I read aloud to a six and seven year old.  Compared to boundless, the Hardy boys have far more lucid action even if it does get a bit predictable after a few volumes.",negative
"Sounded like it was going to be great, but the book itself wasn't all that exciting or interactive.  Nor were the interactive toys unique... seen them all before in other books.",negative
Glad I didn't pay to go see the movie!  Thank goodness it was an audio book or I would never have finished it!,negative
"A good triller, not a page turner for me and I am surprised as the writing style is one that many women can relate to: when we want to update someone, it is often a replay of the whole dialogue (so my husband tells me!).  I found the details a little too much and had on occasions lost the plot as I was not focusing on the storyline as I would have liked with a thriller.  But the details made the relationship between the two sisters really realistic!<br />So the story telling is much in that vein: we learn about the before and after finding the youngest and missing sister (I will try and not give too much plot away) through the various dialogues had between the two sisters as remembered by the older sister.  So you learn of the people in the life of the missing sister and how little the family knew of her life and how much of the past crept into the story line.  Haha, family issues and insecurities come into play as well as the older sister, having given up her job, looses all that tied her down in her former life, and is now hunting for the truth, doing her own detective work since the authorities were satisfied with the outcome and considered the case closed.  It is really worth pursuing to the end of this book as I was a little shocked with the ending.",positive
"The imagery is beautiful.  The card stock is very heavy, and the size of the cards is quite large and long.  My only complaint is that I wasn't well informed before buying this product and didn't realize that the pips are not illustrated with anything other than swords or cups or what have you.  I am used to the imagery of these cards so it is difficult for me to do a reading without it.  ALSO:  my box arrived without any shrink wrap.  On opening, I see that the smaller box the tarot cards comes in has been opened.  When inspecting the cards, they were all out of order and upside down from each other, obviously shuffled and used before.  I understand that the manufacturer wants to save money on a returned product, but if I'm buying a new deck, I expect one.",negative
