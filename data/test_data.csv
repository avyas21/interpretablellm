Simple message and little writing but so cute and a fun twist at the end! Love it for my littles!,positive
"I love Jo Goodman, but this book just slugged along and I found myself skimming over pages. There was nothing about the book that caught my interest as it was slow building. Mitch was a good character, and Thea was ok, just couldn't understand how anyone could want a personal relationship with her. She comes across as being cold and aloof - how many people would give her chance after chance and still want to keep trying? The book bored me and I could barely finish. Love her historicals, didn't mind this was a contemporary, but seriously, the book should have been a lot shorter - 407 pages of pure sludge.",negative
Love this coloring book!,positive
"Very dis-jointed maps.  The overview map is useless and it is difficult to connect maps on different page to get an idea of where you are in the city.  This map is pretty, but useless.  There is a key to symbols, but searching through 20 pages to find something in the key is insane.  There is no list of points of interest.  Finding anything in Bilbao with this map would take a lot of work and you would have to make your own index.  Additionally so many of the symbols look alike, they are difficult to read and clutter each map.",negative
"I got this and two other joke books for my poor, “bored” and quarantined 15 year old. I hear giggling when he’s reading it so it must be good. I asked him “whatcha laughing about?” The reply is “just reading a book, mom.”<br />  When you can keep a book in the hands of a 15 year old boy, whose sole purpose in life is to be the greatest gamer in the world, you deserve a medal or a trophy! He remembers the jokes. That means he’s capable of remembering things like trash day. Thank you for keeping a book in his hands!",positive
This book was nothing special to the yorkshire Terrier breed. It has the same information in it that you could have read in a generic dog owner manual. Really disappointed so returned.,negative
Nothing new here. Better honey books on the shelves.,negative
"I think this book is strictly the set up a series. That would be fine except...nothing happens. There is a lot of yammering about why to prep for catastrophes, but no actual catastrophe happens. The book just slogs along delving into politics to the point of boredom. I may try the second book later, but right now I need something with moving plot.",negative
"With 500 on the front you would think there are 500 puzzles. WRONG! 54 puzzles and then their answers.  The puzzles are only half a page, about 10 letters by 13 letters, and each puzzle only has 10 words to find. I found mistakes, the same words are used in multiple puzzles, and they are simple.  I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews.",negative
"A friend lent this book to me, so I can't complain about the price.<br /><br />Despite the locations bouncing around London, the Middle East,Ireland and USA's president's vacation home in Connecticut (or is it Rhode Island), the action is dull and the characters are merely two-dimensional.<br /><br />So, despite being a quick read, this, for me, was boring.<br /><br />I do NOT understand how this gets an average of 3 stars, particularly in view of the fact that 56% of the reviews are 2 stars or less.",negative
"MAKE IT, WEAR IT: WEARABLE ELECTRONICS FOR MAKERS, CRAFTERS, AND COSPLAYERS is more valuable for the general ideas than for the specific clothing design projects.  You have to download a lot of cutting patterns (e.g., for T-shirt, skirt), 3D printer files (e.g, battery holder from Thingiverse), and how-to videos (e.g., soldering techniques) to be able to make the illuminated fashions as described.  You will also need to order specific circuit boards, fiber-optic parts, conductive thread, etc.<br /><br />Although instructions for procedures like soldering and sewing are fairly general, there are more detailed directions for unusual procedures like 3D printing directly on fabric.  (You print a few layers of your 3D embellishments before you lay the fabric onto the printing bed and secure it.)  You will need access to a 3D printer or a laser cutter for most of the projects.<br /><br />The projects are as follows:  3D Embellished T-Shirt; Fiber-Optic Fabric Scarf; Fun Festival Hip Pack; Solar Backpack; Starlight Skirt; Programmable Sewn Circuit Cuff; and LED Matrix Purse.  Using them as inspiration, you can go on to make your own fabulous lighted-up costumes and fashion garments.",positive
Needed a lot more Ahkmenrah and Rebecca. Came in perfect condition tho.,negative
"As author T.J. English observes in the Introduction, WHERE THE BODIES WERE BURIED is ""an account of the trial of Whitey Bulger from a particular point of view.""  That point of view is, basically, outrage against the government law enforcement system that recruited a notorious Boston mob boss like Bulger as a ""Top Echelon"" informant, and protected him from prosecution for many years, despite his ongoing criminal activities (including murders, sex with underage girls, drug trafficking, and racketeering).<br /><br />English ""attended every minute and every day of the trial,"" and recounts the daily events in detail, in chronological order.  Thus he successfully captures the tedium of every long criminal trial.  The author's desire to see the full scandal of the FBI's unfortunate involvement with Bulger ""laid bare"" is admirable, but the scandal itself isn't all that interesting if you haven't heard of Bulger and his crimes before picking up this book.<br /><br />WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED represents a lot of research (through interviews with witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and former federal agents), and is reasonably well-written.  However, as one more reporter's eyewitness account of a famous criminal trial, it's boring.  Those who are already familiar with the Boston gangster's crimes will probably find it more interesting than I did.  I rate it at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",negative
I a fan of Tom Clancy. This is a new author for me.  I will buy more of his books. Story was a little slow in places,positive
"The imagery is beautiful.  The card stock is very heavy, and the size of the cards is quite large and long.  My only complaint is that I wasn't well informed before buying this product and didn't realize that the pips are not illustrated with anything other than swords or cups or what have you.  I am used to the imagery of these cards so it is difficult for me to do a reading without it.  ALSO:  my box arrived without any shrink wrap.  On opening, I see that the smaller box the tarot cards comes in has been opened.  When inspecting the cards, they were all out of order and upside down from each other, obviously shuffled and used before.  I understand that the manufacturer wants to save money on a returned product, but if I'm buying a new deck, I expect one.",negative
"I found Little Secrets by Jennifer Hillier to be quite the page turner.  The story is about a woman who's child goes missing.  She becomes an emotional wreck and is barely getting by. The one day she finds out that her husband is cheating on her and suddenly she has purpose again. Just about everyone in the book is keeping a little secret. Those little secrets are actually big secrets. There are lots of twists and turns which kept me interested. Throughout the book, some of those secrets would be revealed or hinted out and I would start to change my guesses as to what really happened. I was able to figure most things out before the big reveal, but I think that was the author's intention. The ending was satisfying.",positive
"Our kindergartner is studying different habitats right now, and will be taking a field trip to the Birch Aquarium in a couple weeks, so I thought this would be a great book for him. Both him and his 3 yr old sister enjoyed this book being read to them. It's a nice little short story that rhymes but also has little tidbits off to the side that explain things in the ocean in more detail. For my 3 year old I just read the story, but my 6 year old also likes to be read the detailed excerpts.",positive
"Roberta did a good job reporting what the official line was. Alas, the truth lay elsewhere.",negative
"In reality this is kind of an inane book, but it is visually stunning and brings back lots of memories, good and bad, about the franchise.  From remembering what it was like in 1977 watching New Hope for the first time to wincing through anything Annikan related.  It was a walk through the last 40+ years for me, and as long as a fan keeps their expectations in line, I think anyone can enjoy flipping through this book.  Perhaps the lists are meant to start a little debate and a little hard core fact checking.  It's a fun book for the Star Wars fan.",positive
The only thing that is worthwhile with this book is the pretty cover.  I ordered two books; one for myself and one for a friend.  Both books got tossed into the Goodwill bag.  Huge disappointment.,negative
"this is my first and maybe it's an acquired taste. I'm not far into it either so maybe it will improve as it goes along. however, at this point I won't be buying another from this author.",negative
"I own several pie-centric cookbooks like [[ASIN:0764576348 Bubby's Homemade Pies]], so I was curious to see what new twists Not-So-Humble Pies would offer. Those updates start in the first chapter, with a pepper jack pastry crust, lemon and lavender short crust pastry, and a cream cheese pastry crust. You'll find new takes on cream, custard, and chiffon pies such as pomegranate cream cheese, cantaloupe cream, orange and dark chocolate cheese, roasted Hatch chilies, apple, and ricotta hand pies, and savory pies such as an apple, brie and bacon tart, lobster pie, and a French-inspired duck confit tart.<br /><br />Unexpected flavor elements like green tea, saffron, rose and wasabi turn up and add a flavor boost. For the more adventurous, you'll find ancho chile, pecan and chocolate toffee pie, habanero passion fruit pie, and strawberry jalapeno pie (many of the exotic pies in particular have a marked Latin influence).<br /><br />The book is surprisingly compact, yet each of its 150 recipes is clearly laid out with a smattering of photos throughout. The font could stand to be a bit larger, and I found the recipe prefaces in blue font to be a bit hard to read from a distance, but overall the layout is pleasing and easy to use.<br /><br />Beginning bakers may find the introduction too perfunctory to effectively coach; there are no illustrations and no glossary / guide to recommended equipment, but if you are already comfortable with the basics of making a pie crust and pie from scratch, you'll find much to enjoy in Not-So-Humble Pies if you're willing to experiment with new flavors and accents.",positive
Just watch the movie about Beatrix Potter and it brought back a lot of childhood memories which prompted me to want to reread her stories.  I will be reading them to my 4 year old grandson for fun and I think he will really enjoy them as much as I did.,positive
"Sadly, that sound you hear is the ball being dropped.  I didn't realize Rowling didn't actually write this but it sure makes sense after reading it. There are some good things in it, it has the bones of possibly being a decent story, but the characters are so.....out of character. The dialogue is forced and unnatural and most of it just doesn't ring true.  And now for specifics that are SPOILERS.......<br /><br />Voldemort with a daughter? I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around that one. It's way worse than trying to imagine your parents having sex, to be truthful.<br />And making Harry watch his parents murder? Nope. Would the real Harry Potter have been able to calmly watch that? I think it would have been a lot better for them to leave as Voldemort was going up the walk. I think we all would have been happier.<br /><br />I'm sad. This had potential but as it is......epic fail.",negative
Not my cup of tea - I don't like short stories that leave you hanging.,negative
"I couldn't wait for this book to come out.  I read all of Stephen King's books, and this one did not disappoint.  I love the fact that I can pre-order.",positive
"Several of my friends from my book club recommended this book to me and I finally had some free time to sit down and read it. It was an engaging story about a young woman in the 1770's trying to save her family farm. There were some religious references & lots of prayers to God, but it wasn't preachy by any means. The story was fast paced & had plenty of adventure as well as romance. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The characters were likeable & I am looking forward to reading the next story Feeding on Ashes.",positive
DO NOT buy!  Written for a 2nd or 3rd grader. Actually the book can be read in 5-10 minutes and I am a slow reader. Typical sentence &#34;Alsace is a small country.&#34; Really! No substance at all. This is barely a pamphlet. I feel like they stole our money on this book. Worst ever non-fiction purchase we've made.,negative
"In December 2006, my home state of Oregon was getting all sorts of national media coverage, and none of it was good. In early December, the Kim family - wife, husband, and two daughters from California - got lost traveling a logging road in the Southern Oregon snow. The father died from exposure while trying to find help; the mother and daughters were found alive. Then just two weeks later, three climbers went missing on Mount Hood. Our hearts already broken for the Kim family's loss, many Oregonians stayed glued to the news as the search for the hikers was complicated by horrible weather on the mountain. We were all hoping for the very best for these hikers and their families, but it would turn out to be another sad tragedy in our great state.<br /><br />When I saw that Karen James, wife of one of the climbers lost on Mount Hood, had written a book about her family's experiences, I was eager to read this story from her perspective. To me, she was a name and a face on my daily news during that dark month of December 2006. But in Holding Fast: The Untold Story of the Mount Hood Tragedy, I got to meet her and her amazing family, hear the love story behind her marriage to Kelly James, and discover the lasting faith that carried her through her loss.<br /><br />Holding Fast is a moving account of Karen's unwanted journey. It's written in a very conversational tone, creating an intimate atmosphere full of feeling. She gives precious insight into the passion that drove Kelly James to climb many of the world's greatest mountains. She shows how her faith, and the faith of Kelly's children, guided them through their unimaginable trials. She also pieces together details of Kelly's final hours, providing a likely scenario for what happened on the mountain and how Kelly honored his family in the last moments of his life.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and read it in just a few hours. I felt glad to be taken into Karen James' confidence and encouraged by the strength of her faith and the admonition she gives that we ought to appreciate every moment we have while our loved ones are here with us on earth.<br /><br />Thank you to Thomas Nelson for this review copy.",positive
"When I order a book marketed as a mystery/thriller, I expect a relatively easy-to-read, entertaining book--a novel to be read for the story, and then given away or recycled.  What I do NOT want is a book with a plot that dribbles out information about what actually happened or is happening to the characters, or that makes the reader’s job difficult by jumping around in timelines, and/or shifting abruptly from one first-person viewpoint character to another.  Why should anyone bother to read a throwaway mass-market novel that transforms pleasure-reading into a demanding job?<br /><br />THIS IS HOW IT ENDS is one of the worst examples I’ve yet encountered of a mass-market “mystery/thriller” that (1) makes reading the story as difficult as possible for the unsuspecting reader/purchaser, and (2) delivers next to nothing as a reward for the reader's effort in tracking the jumbled-up events.<br /><br />This novel includes a couple of murders, and two female, angst-ridden, first-person  narrators (Ella, Molly).  Perhaps the following partial list of early chapter titles will serve to alert casual mystery/thriller readers as to what they are in for, if they want to attempt this book.<br /><br />Ella Now--6th March<br />Ella Then--6th March--evening<br />Molly Now--6th March<br />Ella Then--6th March<br />Molly Now--7th March<br />Ella Then-- 1st March<br />Molly Now--10th March<br />Ella Then--15th February<br /><br />The chapters go on in the same fashion, with skipping-around “Then” dates for Ella and forward-going “Now” dates for Molly.<br /><br />In my opinion, a novel writer has utterly failed at his/her basic storytelling task, when the reader must read the chapter labels to be able to tell which character is speaking, and the times when the plot events are happening.",negative
"Boring book, sad attempt to mix mythology with fiction. Not into metaphysical super powers.",negative
Always enjoy Lisa Wingate's books!!,positive
"A nice short romance. I had trouble with the dialogue, it just never sounded natural, it never flowed. You may feel differently. I would advise reading a sample and if it sounds good for you it may be an enjoyable read. It certainly is a happily ever after which should be a guarantee for anything labelled 'romance'",negative
I will like it when I begin to read it.,positive

"The book is very helpful to newcomers to Createspace who want to self-publish books with them. Some helpful tips were:<br /><br />1. First steps - a) Decide B+W or color - B+W much cheaper, b) Decide on book size -e.g. 6""x9"", c) Pick color of pages - recommend cream for novel, white for nonfiction, d) Consider ProPlan pricing or not, e) Suggest photos @ 300DPI. f) Create account at [...], g) Createspace will assign ISBN and EAN numbers for free h) Decide how the book will be marketed - either at Amazon.com or the Createspace e-store, or both.<br /><br />2. Book uses MS Word and Powerpoint as ways to create text and cover. So, less helpful for readers who want to use other products. Suggests title page, copyright page, dedication page, table of contents, plus other tips including page layout, fonts - recommends serif for titles, non-serif for text, raster graphics not vector, title on spine only if book more than 130 pages, front cover should look good whereas back cover should appeal to reason. Must create PDF files.<br /><br />3. Then upoad PDF files.<br /><br />In summary, helpful for newcomers to Createspace, plus underscores that one can self-publish a book for free, the only charges are for any proof copies ordered and, optionally, for the Pro Plan, currently at $39, which allows the author to receive higher royalties. Also, the contract is non-exclusive, so the author can cancel at anytime and sign with another publisher.",positive
Loved this book....as a financial advisor  I loved the link to jewels  as currency  and the history. I  wish it had  pictures of shiny objects!,positive
"Received this one as a gift.  What a nice surprise it turned out to be.  With Have a Little Faith, Michael Elliott has delivered a John Hiatt bio that reads like a fine Hiatt LP.  It's concise, observational, to-the-point, revels in clever turns-of-phrase, and finds hope and truth in the simple yet complex ways the road of life takes us.  It reads like a series of time-tested classic Hiatt compositions.  Like a lot of folks, I came to Hiatt first by covers (Three Dog Night's Sure as I'm Sitting Here, Bonnie Raitt's Thing Called Love, Desert Rose Band's She Don't Love Nobody), then by his career changing Bring the Family LP.  And what a wonderful career it has turned out to be!  But the backstories are deep and wide, and Hiatt has survived and thrived over many a heartbreak and setback.  You don't have to know all of his music to enjoy this read, but it helps to have a handle on the most important among his songs and albums.  One story in particular really hit me: When he's in Elvis Presley's Rolls and kind of breaks into tears, explaining it was because he realized ""just how trapped he was ...  Just trapped.  He was just a poor mama's boy from Mississippi.""  As a lifelong fan of Elvis, I could truly relate to John Hiatt's humanity in this special moment.  Riding with the King, indeed.  Highly recommended.",positive

"When the nosy neighbor is your Mom and you're a cop... I'd forgotten what fun the Rizzoli & Isles books are and ""Listen to Me"" was a great reminder!  Angela is driving Jane nuts, first with he concern about 16 year old Tricia's disappearance (so what if she's run away before.  This time it could be a crime) and her incessant spying on her new neighbors who are very standoffish.  She cannot understand why her daughter, the cop, is not available to take on her projects just because she's investigating the brutal murder of a beloved nurse.  Along the way, we learn Maura Isles is playing piano with an amateur orchestra of local doctors, that Angela is on to something and that Jane knows her stuff as she works alongside Frost and tries not to be to honest with him about what she thinks of his wife.  A nonstop entertaining read full of marvelous characters.  Have to backfill the books in the series I missed along the way.",positive
"This is a fictional story that is as engaging and real as any true story.  ""Alive Day: A Story of Love and Loyalty "" is about a blind psychiatrist and his guide dog who help a paralyzed Marine see that he still has a wonderful and fulfilling life to live.  The story definitely has the propensity to be true and certainly encourages the reader to contemplate their disabilities in life and how they can adjust to them.  It also ends on a beautiful note.",positive
"Prior to reading this, I was unfamiliar with the deadly London fog or Reg Christie. I read The Devil in the White City many years ago and loved it, so since this was compared to it, I wanted to give it a try. The subject was interesting and well researched. It was a bit slow and choppy at times. I felt that it jumped around a lot to the point that it confused me every now and then. It didn't have the flow that The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson. I don't usually read nonfiction books, but Larson's book read like a novel. I didn't feel that I was reading nonfiction. This one didn't read as easily. There were a few times where it resembled fiction, but most of the time it felt like I was reading something for school. Overall, I did like it. It was informative and interesting.",positive

So far so good. My second grader is on the letter U so far. There are only 1 or 2 letters so far that I didn’t care for the style(as in it wasn’t how I was taught cursive). He asked me if he could learn cursive and this is what I gave him. He likes it!,positive

"The things this book has going for it are as follows:<br /><br />Great dog stories<br />Great dog<br />Dog<br /><br />Let's face it, the most interesting thing about this memoir is how the dog interacts with the author and his friends and roommates.  More like a blog, I didn't care for the writing style, or for the repetitive reporting on beach house parties, cycling expeditions and whatnot.<br /><br />Yes, he does have an unusual bunch of roommates, and his experiences are stranger than fiction, but this isn't really surprising as the main criterion for selection is having someone to look after the dog.<br /><br />Billed as a memoir, we really don't learn very much about the author, except that his wife left him, he has a wonderful dog, and that he leaves the dog behind on a regular basis while in the pursuit of happiness.  It comes over as a rather one-dimensional look at a certain period of his life, and I really wish the author had fleshed out his experiences and provided us with more detail and depth.<br /><br />While this book didn't do it for me, it may be of interest to people who like golden retrievers, the singles scene, and first person accounts of bad roommates.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 2, 2010",negative
This had to be the messiest book I’ve read in a long time. I didn’t like the characters (I HATE whiny) and the only good thing was the premise. The story jumps all around and too many things are going on. Lexi has a split personality. One minute she’s a tough and confident business woman and the next she’s an indecisive and petulant child. This one didn’t deliver.  (I voluntarily reviewed an ARC).,negative
"This is a beautiful book! It has a beautiful sentiment and gorgeous photographs. It is something you can pick up and read here and there. You don't have to read it in any kind of order if you don't want to. It's interesting to see how different people from different places answer the question, ""What does love mean to you?"". It left me feeling hopeful.",positive

"Although I love LEGO and miniatures, I’ve never been particularly interested in building microscale LEGO models--there is too much loss of detail in the end.  This book, LEGO MICRO CITIES:  BUILD YOUR OWN MINI METROPOLIS!, illustrates the “problem”:  although the colorful endpapers show four different city models (Bridge Town, Hyperloop City, Steamworks, Upper Brick Side), the models and buildings all look very similar.  There are only so many different “looks” that you can achieve by combining the smaller LEGO elements.<br /><br />The book has complete instructions for eight different city models.  The ones not previously mentioned are Gilded City, Tomorrowland, Utopia, and Strange New Worlds.<br /><br />Basically, this book is helpful for LEGO fans who want to get started on building their own microscale architectural models (models along the lines of the official LEGO sets in the “Architecture” theme series).  It explains how to construct different types of tiny buildings (round, rectangular, or stacked skyscrapers, for instance), as well as how to create tiny but recognizable trains, ships, trees, statues, trees, etc.  There are also tips on how to solidly attach various components to the baseplate and other elements.<br /><br />Hardcore LEGO aficionados will enjoy looking through this well-done book.  However, it’s quite limited in scope, and of course you will end up buying bricks if you want to replicate the models shown in the book.",positive

"This is a gripping story that keeps you reading to the end. It does start out slowly though, and had me wondering what I was getting into. Many of the chapters are on the long side, which don't work well for reading in small chunks, so I had to make time to read it. The book tells the story of 4 women and the payback to wealthy man who often seemed above the law who had hurt them at one time or another. The women's relationships to one another was well written. The events weren't far fetched which made them believable. Overall, I found it well worth my time reading it.",positive

"My husband is a small business owner and would like me to help out with the bookkeeping. I have very little bookkeeping experience and knowledge. This book is very comprehensive. The layout is good and there is lots of useful information. I especially like how detailed the table of contents is because it's made it very easy for me to locate sections that I have wanted to access. I started reading it like a regular book, but found jumping around as needed easier for me. It's written well and it doesn't seem to be talking down to me which I appreciate. I'm not ready to completely take over the books yet, but this has been helping me understand the vocabulary and overall procedures for helping my husband.",positive

"Although dated (1971), Philip J. Klass's SECRET SENTRIES IN SPACE is a good introduction to U.S. (and Soviet) space reconnaissance systems. While I had heard about this book a few years back, what peaked my interest and led me to purchase it was the fact it is mentioned in a recently declassified (September 17, 2011) Top Secret National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) publication, A HISTORY OF THE HEXAGON PROGRAM (April 2012), available on Amazon.com. Of note is this paragraph:<br /><br />""One of the magazines continually publishing articles on the progress of this nation's reconnaissance programs is AVIATION WEEK [or AVIATION LEAK, as it's jokingly referred to it!] Other publications have sporadically covered this area of government activity, but the most prolific writer on the subject has been AVIATION WEEK'S Philip J. Klass. He did a thorough job in summarizing his knowledge of the United States reconnaissance program in a book titled 'Secret Sentries in Space'. Although lacking in some details, and slightly inaccurate in others, little is left to the imagination of our nation's adversaries. What is really damaging is the impact these public revelations have on people involved in reconnaissance programs. After each public announcement of the newest advances in this country's space reconnaissance activities it is necessary for program management in both government and industry to caution their personnel not to discuss or confirm these stories.""<br /><br />Enough said!",positive

"I discovered this series of books at the library."" Dear Pen Pal"" was the first one that I read (it's actually third in the series), and I was hooked! I could hardly wait to read the others, because references were made about events from the first two books in ""Pen Pal"".  I've now read all five, including ""Home for the Holidays"".  This is a great series of books, especially for this day and time. There are no instances of smoking, drinking, or sex. The characters have crushes, and an occasional kiss, but that's as far as it goes.(Very unusual for recently written books!)  The characters are modern teenagers who all have endearing as well as annoying qualities. Their personalities and interests are varied, but they are still friends and share the common bond of being in the book club with their moms. I especially liked how the moms and grandmoms that were in the club were involved with and cared about all of the girls, not just their own offspring.<br />  I think this series would appeal to readers of the Baby-Sitter Club books.  Girls who have enjoyed those books but are ready for a more challenging reading level would find ""The Mother-Daughter Book Club"" to be very interesting and easy to relate to, in my opinion. Hopefully, girls will be also be inspired to read or re-read books by Alcott, Austen, Montgomery and Lovelace, and perhaps even begin their own clubs. Thanks to Ms. Frederick for writing this wonderful series! I hope there are more books in the future!",positive
"There are alot of books on the F-117A Nighthawk, and most are repetative. The older books rehash the same old story and contain the same old pictures. Yancy Mailes and Tony Landis have broken new ground with more fascinating facts about this great warbird and never before published pictures and artwork in their concise (108 pages), but awesome ""photo scrapbook."" This new material comes from people who were actually involved with the most difficult flight test program in aviation history - the developers, testers, pilots, and maintainers. Also contains great pictures and artwork of Northrop's XST and TACIT BLUE prototypes, and Lockheed's ATB SENIOR PEG entry and the F-117N design for the U.S. Navy. THIS IS THE BOOK THAT F-117A NIGHTHAWK ENTHUSIASTS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR! Do yourself a favor and pick up this outstanding book!",positive
"A good novel about WWII on Okinawa Japan.  A young man who is a member of a youth military corps is trying to survive with friends and family a battle for Okinawa between the Americans and Japan.  The island residents are technically Japanese but historically been Okinawan and speak another language.  The Japanese soldiers are under severe stress and willing to kill the residents at the drop of a hat.  They have warned them the Americans are devils who will poison them with tainted food and water if they accept help.  The boy does accept help from the Americans but has trouble too.  Nothing is clear and safety is tenuous.  The only thing he has to protect himself and his family is a grenade that he was given in school.  But should he use it?  And whom should he use it on?  A pretty good book but I was disappointed that it was not as good as Refugee, the author's last novel which won several awards.",positive
"First let me say that I am new to the vegan diet, so I have collected a handful of books I thought would help me... having said that - this cookbook has NO photos.  :(  But... it still has a long list of useful recipes.  Most are listed gluten free and soy free - if that matters to you.  At the top of each page and under the recipe name it tells you this info...  I haven't found any strange ingredients (meaning you can't find what you need at the local grocery store - as we live in a small rural town) and no super special pieces of kitchen equipment... so I consider that a bonus.  I am not a trained culinary chef and I manage to understand the process of these recipes... I am a fan of one pot cooking (in all fairness some of the recipes use more than one pot - but served in one bowl..), so this book appealed to me.  I like the Red Bean Gumbo (however I replace the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper as I am not a fan of green bell pepper and I omit the okra - not a fan of that either)...  very satisfying. In the book it mentions that &#34;gumbo&#34; is the African word for okra!  Hmm... I like gumbo... but sans the okra. haha.  In any case, I purchased this cookbook and a handful of others to help inspire me to try to eat vegan.  Now... if we could get them to add photos and a spiral back (to help keep the book open while you are using it in the kitchen) it would be a 6 star.  :)",positive
"I am and omnivore living with vegetarians and I am always looking for workable plant based solutions.  This book has a number of ideas that I will explore, but there are not a whole lot of eye opening ones.  Unfortunately, I am apparently not enough of a visionary to know what something should look like, so I kind of need photos to inspire me a bit.  I do wish that this series of cookbooks had better photos, but still get a lot of value out of them.",positive
although a little creepy it wasn't really scary. and the ending was flat. So I can only give one star.,negative
"I was locked in within the first chapter! As a 75 year old woman living with a husband who lives for Sci-Fi, I chose this book only  after reading excellent reviews--yet with a bit of skepticism.<br />Wondering how this writer could do Sci-Fi differently with all that's out there, I wanted to see if I would recommend it to my husband--especially since it seemed to be targeted for young adults.<br />It was an immediate page turner! Such an unusual & exciting journey, it had me sitting on the edge of my seat.  I truly hope it will become a movie! My husband has already started it.  And I can't wait for the next book to be available!!!  Write ON dear author!",positive
Enjoyed the story and exposure to the country's people and culture. No matter the area the ugliness of human nature always rests it's hard and we need warriors to stand in the gap till Jesus comes.,positive
"Another, albeit my last, terrible book out of India. There's nothing new in here. All the stories in this book have been around forever. They've just been poorly rewritten. Old tales such as 'The Giving Tree' and the story of the ant and grasshopper are aped by this author along with what looks like images found with a Google image search. Some are photos others cartoons there's no consistency. Yes, morals are a good thing to instil in our children just not with this book.<br /><br />This book was free on Amazon when the author emailed me and asked me to obtain and review a copy.",negative
"Hell's Bay is another great book by James Hall.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat, especially at the end, so you want to finish it rather than go to bed!!  Great characters and this would make a good movie.  He really describes the Florida swampland well.  Highly recommend this book.",positive
"I bought these to use with our Jesus Storybook Bible.They were not at all what I expected. They are loose pages, not in a book form and not hole-punched for storing. They are full color, which sounds cool, except that means there are no coloring type activities. There wasn't a lot to DO with these. I was pretty disappointed. They don't copy well, either, because they are full color. I wouldn't recommend these at all.",negative

Really good read.,positive
Never got it,negative
"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of a mix between ""Extras"" by Scott Westerfeld and ""Matched"" by Ally Condie. It did has its own flair, but it had many of the futuristic and political set-ups of those two books. It is a futuristic dystopia book, which is something I love. It is apparently the first in a series, but it is a complete story in and of itself. (Which anyone who reads teen fiction knows is not always the case with these new series type books.)<br />All in all, I like this book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.<br />A note to parents: There are a couple curse words in the book, but it is not overwhelming or even frequent. (There are maybe two or three curse words.) There is also mention of teen sexuality. The make-out scenes are more awkward than anything, but they are there. (And it is just rolling around kissing sort of thing.) I do wish she would have abbreviated these ""scenes"" to be more vague and less awkward to read, but they are explicit or graphic.",positive
Unless you've lived in New York - the sarcasm wears thin quickly. Didn't finish it.,negative
"This is a great series. But I don't understand how Amazon can allow book sellers to charge $900 or $1,000 for this book. That just seems absolutely outrageous. The book is no longer in print and I'd love to be able to read it but not at these prices.",negative

"This is a very nostalgic cookbook. It has recipes from several different Disney parks. Most of the recipes were unfamiliar to me, but I did recognize a few. I have been to all of the Orlando parks several times, so I was excited to see this. The layout and design of the cookbook is good. It's very professional looking. I haven't noticed any errors yet, but I haven't been thoroughly reading it. My family has picked out a few recipes for us to try.",positive
"A stand-alone historical novel, this tells a theoretical construction story of the technology behind neolithic standing stones building, as the subtext of the main personal drama.  Interesting tribal intrigues and the characters held my interest most of the time.  While I liked the book, it wasn't as close a fit for the author as the historic novels set in medieval Briton.  Even so, a worthwhile read that is quite enjoyable.",positive

"If I had one complaint about Isekai/LitRPG tales its the fact that so many of the writers in this genre seem to write horrible main characters.  And this tale had to be one of the worst I've run into.  The main character as usual ends up in a new world, and in this case he's in a robot body at first.  He's the new fighting robot for one of the students in an all girl school.<br /><br />And what does this male soul do?  If you didn't guess that he obsesses over his robot body needing a certain appendage and what color/type of undergarments the girls are wearing then you haven't read many of these tales.<br /><br />And in this case I found that I hated the main character.  He was just a jerk.  He was a jerk before he ended up in this world, and actually managed to become worse after.  He didn't care about anyone except himself and his ""needs"".  it was so much of a bad tale because the character was nothing more than a big....... (you can probably fill in the blank.)<br /><br />I dislike tales that don't build up characters well, and this one definitely didn't.",negative
i'm currently listening to it for the d3rd time.  Interesting perspective and def helps you think differently about some issues.,positive
"I don't read the blog, but I bought the book anyway. I wasn't exactly aware of how much the author likes the F word. I found the book amusing.

That is, I wasn't very excited until I started reading through this guide book! Now, I am super excited and hope that this becomes our destination!!  This is a comprehensive guide book about the country. It's well laid out and easy to follow. The pictures are colorful and vibrant. The only criticism of the book is the pages and cover are light weight and flimsy. Other than that, it's a great introduction to the country.",positive
"The book has some interesting historical tidbits; however, there aren't really any outstanding different pickling recipes.  The recipes are very basic and can easily be found elsewhere.<br /><br />My big disappointment in this book was there were no pictures, none whatsoever.  I think it was a huge missed opportunity for the author.  And the book was not cheap.<br /><br />I would have returned it but it was a gift.  Ugh.",negative
"Purchased for my mom for her birthday and she reads a verse to me almost everyday. Good product, excellent purchase.",positive
"This book caught my attention because of the historical 1960's setting. It did not disappoint; I loved the details about happenings at the pool, about the music, the drive-in theaters, etc. There are also deeper elements, such as the controversy about sending soldiers to Vietnam. I really came to understand why Tree's father felt as he did about this. It made me think about how important it was, and is now,<br /> to support the military soldiers, even if you don't agree with the government that sends them to fight.<br />The issues of domestic abuse that Tree finds herself in the middle of really gave me sympathy for her situation; I've been in similar dilemmas. Do you risk losing a friendship to speak up and say, &#34;Hey, this can't go on?&#34;<br />I was very moved by the situation of Jack in Vietnam. I did think the book dropped off just a bit too quickly after that, but a fairy tale ending would have ruined it.<br />Overall reaction: Hard to explain, but reading this book gave me &#34;warm fuzzies&#34;, for lack of a more technical term. I wanted to be Tree's friend, and meet all the people she cared about so much, I will definitely read it again; I almost started it over right after finishing it (I don't do that with many books!)<br />I think a sequel would be a great idea! I'll be looking for more books by this author.",positive

"This is a good cookbook with a nice amount of introductory information to start looking at a vegetarian lifestyle.  The recipes look good but I was a little disappointed that there are no photos or illustrations.  Personally, I need to have photos to inspire me into making a recipe.

"I always suspected that statins work to reduce cholesterol through its anti-inflammatory ability and after reading this book my suspicious were confirmed.  I also know from personal experience that statins cause permanent neuropathy and severe muscle pain. When I told my doctor that the statins were causing my neuropathy, he told me &#34;YOU'RE WRONG.&#34; Well he was wrong and now I am going to suffer for the rest of my life because of it. Had I known, I never would have tried them or would have stopped them in time so as not to do damage.<br /><br />This book is EXTREMELY technical in my opinion. I had a hard time following the scientific explanations supporting his theories as to why statins cause harm. Despite the technical jargon, I came away knowing more than I knew before. Besides causing diabetes, statins are responsible for memory loss, confusion, forgetfulness, and deaths due to the breakdown of muscle tissue. He also makes a case for why statins cause neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, ALS, MS, etc. What I also found interesting is that statins may increase a man's life one to two years but they have never been proven to be effective in increasing life expectancy for women.<br /><br />Other than the scientific nature of this book, I feel it is a worthwhile read. It certainly a good idea for anyone thinking of going on statins to read this first in order to make their own informed decision. On another note, I did not feel this book adequately addressed what should be done instead of taking statins; I was really lost by all the scientific talk.",positive
"This is one of a series of books, very interesting and uses one's imagination well.  Love the old photo's that are weaved into the story.",positive

"I have enjoyed all three of the books in the Rosie trilogy. While the first one remains to be my favorite, this one is pretty good. When reading these books, I can't help by picture the character Sheldon Cooper as Don. I work in special ed, specifically with autistic children and I find the mannerisms and vocabulary to be pretty spot-on. It took me a lot longer than it should have to read this title only because I had difficulties finding the time to sit and read. It was pretty easy to pick up and read a little here and there. It was probably a little longer than it needed to be, but I'm not sure what could be left out. Anyway, I found this to be enjoyable and entertaining.",positive

"In Linda L. Richards' Death Was the Other Woman, Kitty Pangborn had no intention of becoming a shamus (private eye), but when she landed a job as secretary to hard-drinking, haunted Great War vet Dexter J. Theroux, she's on the case. Kitty and Dex traipse across Prohibition- and Depression-era Los Angeles on the trail of Rita Heppelwaite, mistress of a powerful mob figure, and the web of lies that Rita spins.<br /><br />Kitty makes a believable narrator as a girl whose diminished circumstances have left her with a newfound sense of independence (Kitty's reunion with her private high school chums was a reminder of the rapid reversal of fortunes that the Crash of '29 inflicted on wealthy families). Not one to wallow in her misfortunes, she goes out and lands a job as a secretary (since the years of etiquette training and upper-class mannerisms don't come in handy in the working world). She and Dex make a good team as she understands his dark, alcohol-fueled melancholy; she keeps him straight when he's too drunk to drive, which is frequently. However, theirs is strictly a working relationship, and Kitty's love life is nonexistent.<br /><br />Populated by a fascinating cast of characters including Mustard, a ""procurement"" specialist who may have mob ties, the haunted Dex, Rita and the glitzy world of upscale bootlegger clubs, and several criminal elements, the main character might as well be 1930s LA. Chock-full of 1930s period details about the architecture and culture of Los Angeles (vintage cars, diners, districts, early highway travel), Death Was the Other Woman also revels in its 1930s vocabulary and noir trappings that accent a gritty, fast-paced story into the seedy underbelly of organized crime during Prohibition (and a microcosm of the Depression, as Kitty's story is a riches-to-rags one). Fans of pulp stories and film noir will find a lot to love here.",positive
"Stodgy, badly written.",negative
"California Comeback<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars.....<br /><br />The author, Narda Zacchino, is well-qualified to analyze what is happening in California, both by growing up and having a long, distinguished journalism career in pCalifornia.<br /><br />And I, having lived in California since 1973, think she has done a fine job in concluding that this is not just a comeback, but as her subtitle states, a model for the nation.<br /><br />The book starts with the California Dream beginning with the 1849 Gold Rush and the hope for anyone striking instant wealth, but just be story until 1963 when CA overtook NY as the most populous state, signaling the Eastern elite better take notice. Governor Pat Brown, inspired by FDR's New Deal, basically had brought about a CA New Deal,<br /><br />Then CA turns Right, the Reagan Revolution, all leading up to the 2008 crash, where CA was ridiculed.<br /><br />Enter Jerry Brown, Pat's son, as governor in 2011. Having been governor from 1975 to 1983, plus having served in many positions like Secretary of State, Attorney General and Oakland mayor. Always socially liberal and fiscally conservative, plus with such experience, pragmatic, he set CA on a remarkable path, just passing France as the world's 6th largest economy and distancing itself from the previously heralded Texas model.<br /><br />The book covers many more details and history, such that I do recommend the book.",positive

Well, if it doesn't bother you..the odd feeling pages and the almost typewriter over inked print..then this book will do. Obviously story is a classic for kids!

"The presence of suspense you can feel deep in your bones is what makes us walk around gripping the book, unable to put it down, eyes glued to every word for a clue to the conclusion, blood tingling at the end of every chapter...until that page is turned and  we are thrown a crumb that allows the roller coaster ride to continue.  Am I asking for too much?  I had all these thrills with most of the other Alex Crosses - but this one just didn't have it.  I enjoyed hearing about the early life with Maria, and how she died, but I got a little tired of the Butcher's scalpelous exploits.  Okay, we know what kind of a monster he is.  Didn't we expect that he'd get a little of his own surgery in the end, so to speak?  Probably performed by the mafioso?  I mean, come on, James - two shots from Sampson?  The guy was a barbarian, and I think we would have all felt better if the last scene involved a course taught by the mafia - Meatcutting 101?  Friends, I am really not giving away the plot, as you will know early on how this book must conclude.  Am I advising another book choice?  Surprisingly, no. You will be happy to know that Alex is finally at peace with the loss of his wife.  And, I think we all feel better for that, as we want the best for Alex.  We just can't expect a guy who puts out a jillion books a year to hit the hot button every single time.  I am still a fan, and will be waiting at the bookstore for the next one.  I loved Judge and Jury, went through the book-gripping thing, carried it around, felt the thrill, etc.  Just not this one.  Sorry.",negative
"As a Dan Brown novel, Origin is just okay, certainly no Da Vinci Code.  As one reviewer noted, the novel felt ""unauthentic,""  and for several reasons I agree.  It did not have the same flow as other Dan Brown novels.  And most of the plot elements seem to be pulled directly from the news of the past few years, not particularly original.  But for a novel written mostly by artificial intelligence (AI), if it was, it's not bad as a mass-produced Turing test.",negative
The entire concept of someone able to live on after they'd died (at birth or by accidental drowning or whatever!) and reappear was just too much.

"This book by Thay is an incredible resource for teachers!!  It's a very unique book in that it has short and simple instructions for the various aspects of practicing mindfulness for adults/teachers (i.e. Walking, sitting, eating, etc. meditations), great ways to teach students, and has input how teachers from around the world have incorporated these practices into their classrooms demonstrating a wide variety of creative ways to engage students of all ages.

"One of my literati friends gave this to me for my birthday last year as a joke since I always talk about writing more but I always manage to procrastinate. Joel Saltzman's &quot;If You Can Talk You Can Write&quot; was both funny and insightful and helped me kick some of my bad writing habits (being too much of a perfectionist during early drafts, beating writer's block, revising). After I read it I sat down the next day and followed Joel's advice: write about whatever, as long as I was writing again. This is like writer therapy (or rehabiliation). It got me off my chesterfield and back at the keyboard.<br />This is a great tool for student writers and university writing courses. If I ever decide to teach creative writing, this book will definitely be on my required reading list. Too many writers burn out from many of the topics Joel discusses, such as being too critical, too much of a perfectionist, or labouring away trying to imitate the style of the classic writers instead of finiding your own unique voice.",positive

I should have paid attention to other reviews.  Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel.  If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required.  Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents.  I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it.  Will probably just delete it.,negative
"I've read and ejoyed many of Dean Koontz books.  This one, however seems to have been written by someone else.  Koontz tries to make the characters of this story interesting by pouring on lots of colorful dialog.  Unfortunately, the dialog is more corny than colorful.  I listened to the audio version of this book and found myself turning it off time and time again.  I just couldn't stand listening to the long-winded rants and multi-adjective descriptions that pepper much of the book.  Koontz tries hard to make his characters ""hip"", but he does not succeed.  One tip off to this is the unbelievably lame character names.  Leilani Klonk??????  C�mon Dean... what were you thinking.  I was very dissapointed in this offering from a writer who has proven he is capable of much, much better.",negative
"This graphic novel is essentially the memories of the author, with vignettes from their life.  Some of the vignettes are stories and graphics she drew back in high school, while others are just memories from her school years and college.  Several of them were really funny and I thought, even insightful.  One of them is about staying on a houseboat with a friend and not being allowed to use the toilet on board.  Another is about the neurosis behind making a decision on eye glasses.  Other stories deal with LGBTQ relationships and drama, dealt with in humor and reality.<br /><br />Overall, it was not a great read, but I did think some of the stories were really hilarious and cut to the bone of human reactions in a pretty smart way.",negative
"Citizen Reporter Nick Daniels has been given the scope of a lifetime....the opportunity to interview an ex-Yankee pitcher turned recluse, who apparently betrayed all of New York for drugs and a gambling debt. However, it would appear that time has not changed Robinson and again he is late for the show. What Daniels never expected was to be an eyewitness to a mob hit, while he was waiting for Robinson, at the table right beside him. As Daniels delves into the mystery of the murder and follows the clues to the truth, he soon realizes that everything is more complicated than he initially thought.<br /><br />As far as Patterson collaborations go, this one is average. This is a semi-decent thriller with an underlying love story (that is predictable). It is a quick and easy read. While I don't think reading this novel was a complete waste of time, I am not sure if I would recommend it.",negative

It was a very well-written historical novel and provided a really interesting peek into the lives of women at the turn of the century, as they began to enter the male-dominated workplace and assert their independence.  Little snapshots of everything from the simple pleasure of riding a bicycle ('wheel') and romance at the turn of the century, to being a part of a creative team bringing to life an artists conception and contributing to a viable product.

I have read numerous books by TNH and this one was another wonderful book.  I tend to put sticky notes in my books when I want to go back and refer to important or meaningful points and this book is full of sticky notes!!  TNH (or Thay as his students refer to him) has such a simple way of explaining the dharma and useful ways to deal with all emotions.  A very helpful book and he's such a good writer!!,positive
"This is the third book in the  &#34;For Your Love&#34; series by Shannyn Schroeder. It's a slow moving, but sweet romance. I thought the lead female character was a little boring, but I did like the leading male a lot. A lot of the characters from the first two books in the series are in this one, but for the most part, this is a stand alone title. The story doesn't have the typical conflict that must be resolved, it's more of a small hiccup. It's pretty steam as far as sexual content. Overall, I did like it.",positive

"I so wanted to like, even love, this novel because I really miss my grandma who died age 85, and I really really miss my mom who died age 63, and the premise of all of the women sharing a passion for the same career sounded terrific. Except I didn't like a one of them. I disliked Neva most of all, and was disheartened that they didn't have the closeness that I had anticipated. Lastly they were so professional medicine phobic I don't think I could trust them to save my life if a delivery went bad where I would need surgery to save my life. Chapters alternate among Neva, Grace and Floss.<br /><br />The Sydney Morning Herald has an online article that may sway you to read the novel (as it did me): ""Sally Hepworth: How I gave birth to writing The Secrets of Midwives"".",negative
"Simon Toyne is a terrific writer, and I I loved his previous sanctus trilogy.  So I was excited to read his new book, completely different setting in a small town that has its secrets, and the modern day illegal activities to keep it functioning.  Many layers behind this story, as each character didn't reveal theiron true color right until the end, but in parts, but gutsy with suspense.  It may seem a long road to get to the conclusion, the weaving of the characters added depth to the suspense.  Simon Tyne keeps in suspense right to the end, his trade mark!",positive
"My husband loves to cook, and I dabble.<br />We used to live in the south, so thought this might be nice for him<br />for his birthday.<br /><br />Well, glad I bought it used.<br />There's nothing ""special"" about the recipes in here, if you have cooked<br />for longer than five years. Many of the recipes are fussy, and the ones<br />that are not, are just basic stuff.<br /><br />The recipe for simple syrup, used in a lot of drinks including sweet tea,<br />is not 50/50 like most recipes. This one uses 25/75 sugar to water.<br />Really?<br /><br />All in all, would not recommend and don't plan on using.<br />Nothing unusual or special in here.",negative
"I usually find Christian Children's books to be hokey, unoriginal, and poor quality. This book, while a bit hokey at points, was original and great quality. The pictures are lovely. The story is a bit long for most younger (the under 3 crowd) children to sit through. My acorn obsessed two year old loves the pictures, though. I liked the story. It did get a bit muddled in the end with what Big Girl was doing or deciding. But overall, it is a great story. As a parent, this book might bring a tear or two to your eye as you read to your child. The message? Be the person God has created you to be.",positive
"I work as a teacher's aid in a special education middle school classroom. Our class is a self contained, MID class. Our students range from abilities, but they are all lower intellects. They all have troubles with reading and read at beginning levels. I'm a former elementary teacher and when I started working as an aid last year, I suggested that we use phonics reading sets to work with all of the kids. I collected a few sets last year and we had some success with them. I wanted to get something new for this year, so I found this set. One of the biggest issues with our students is finding material that is interesting to them. They are teenagers and a lot of the phonics sets are too babyish for them. These books are fun and interesting to them. We're not reading things like &#34;see the cat&#34;. The stories are engaging to them. Most of the vocabulary is okay. They do struggle with some of the names of the turtles, but some of the kids are familiar with them already, so their prior knowledge helps them. I wish there were more sets like this with the appeal to older kids.",positive

"I was really so ready to love this book after reading a WONDERFUL article in the Sunday Chicago Tribune.  I thought it sounded scholarly yet very anecdotal in the best sense.  I got instead a lot of self absorbed reminiscing.  I admit I gave up after the fifth stoner story about driving around in Hyde Park and  South Shore.  Stoned and listening to ""Baker Street""?  Really...?  P.S. There is more than one church besides Neri in South Shore!  And what's with the snobbery about hating WFMT?<br />...",negative
"This is very basic and takes too long to make any real progress.  More problematic is the Spanish is so rigid it comes close to incorrect.  For example, the constant use of ""Yo"" in front of the first person verbs.  This is not the way Spanish people speak.  Using ""Yo"" is for emphasis, and is not used generally... it is assumed by the use of the verb.  So if I want to say ""I speak Spanish,"" I would say ""Hablo español"" and not ""Yo hablo español.""",negative
"I really tried to like this book. I wanted to, but honestly, after getting more than half way through it, I still wasn't impressed, nor compelled to keep reading. I finished it, but it felt like a chore rather than a joy.<br /><br />The writing isn't bad and the premise is interesting, but I couldn't get past everyone being referred to by a nickname. It got confusing really quick and since I couldn't feel close to the characters, I really didn't care what happened to them.<br /><br />I guess this one just wasn't for me. You should still check it out though, as it might be just the thing for you.<br /><br />This review is based on a galley copy from netgalley, courtesy of the publisher. All opinions are my own.",negative

"I am a big fan of Kristan Higgins and her books. I have read several of her romances and follow her on Facebook. I would classify this as chick lit. This title was a little slow to get started, but it picked up quickly to the point that I could not put it down. It's a fast paced story about two sisters who are dealing with the loss of their significant others. One becomes a widow after a few months of marriage while the other ones gets dumped by her boyfriend of ten plus years. The sisters are brought together by their sudden singleness and become closer as a result. The descriptions and details in the story are wonderful! The story is witty and charming with some laugh out loud moments. I was thoroughly entertained and was even teary eyed (happy tears) at the end, which never happens to me.",positive
"This book is a good primer on the Six Day War between Israel and Jordan and Syria. The pictures and artwork are good. The only drawback to this book are the maps. Often the text refers to a place or objective that's not on any map. I would prefer more detailed maps so it would be easier to trace the troop movements. Another thing I would like to see is the use of 3-d graphics to better depict troop movements through built-up areas like Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the like. Often topography played a significant role during a battle. A foldout battle map would be idea.",positive

I'm not much of a fan of paranormal stuff, so I could have done without that, but nonetheless, I did find it engaging and entertaining. I partially predicted one aspect of the story, but most of it was surprising. There were some twists and turns that kept me reading. I would consider reading more from this author.",positive

"This was my first Susan Lewis novel and I think choosing it to read was ill-advised as it was far-afield from my favorite genres.  But, what the heck, it sounded like a good story, and I was looking for an easy, fast read.  The first problem was that I had not read the book that preceded this one, so I fumbled my way through all the references to things I had not experienced.  It all fell into place within the first 200 pages, but by this time the redundancy of explanations was starting to irritate.  The second problem arose as I tried to accustom myself to long descriptions and backstories that always seemed to take hundreds of words, when fewer would have done the job concisely.  I never considered myself a writing minimalist, but this novel may have pushed me over that edge.<br /><br />On the two star side, the book is well-written (with the exception that the 500 pages could have  been cut back to 300) and the author has an easy writing style.  I enjoyed being in New Zealand, and appreciated the research Lewis did, which aded a dimension of reality.  The plot was nothing out of the ordinary, and fit a formula we have encountered several times before.  The background of the characters was over the top - did we really have to have a protagonist &#34;orphaned&#34; daughter of a murderer -  kidnapping a child who was fleeing a pedophile?  Add a reunion with a biological mother, a child so traumatized that she doesn't speak, and I was ready to throw in the towel.<br /><br />Sorry I made this sound so miserable - it just wasn't a good reading experience for me.",negative

I'll be far more careful in picking products from this or any other product. This was a terribly disappointing experience.",negative
"I purchased this book as an Anthony Bourdain fan (his fiction and non-fiction books).  This is really not a Bourdain book at all.  It's dry and simplistic, without Tony's tone or way with words.  The transcriptions from his TV shows do not do make the worth the money or the read.  The travel tips are so basic they're probably not even relevant any more.  The author claims to have helped Tony with his previous books and collaborated previous to dis demise, but none of that comes thru.  It's not an Anthony Bourdain book, a good travel guide or a good story ... run if you're looking for any of the above.",negative
"This was my first book by Rosanna Ley and I really enjoyed it. It was well written with beautiful descriptions. Although it was a long book, it was fairly easy to read and kept me engaged. It jumps around a lot between different time periods, but it was not confusing. There's some romance in the book, but it is not the main focus of the story. Prior to reading this, I was unfamiliar with the &#34;Lost Children of Francoism&#34; and although pretty horrific, I found it interesting and I was glad to learn of this historic event. I selected this book because it was set in Spain, but I was disappointed how little that was. Overall, I liked this book and will consider other books by this author.",positive
"Bought this for my  grandson who already has an unbelievable vocabulary for a 2-year-old; however, the book doesn't really keep his interest.  I would recommend waiting til a child is at least 4 before purchasing this book.",positive
"I was expecting to like this book much more than I did. There was some practical stuff in the book, but not as much as I would have hoped. This book presents the husband as the authority in the house. In all areas. At all time. Kitchen needs to be remodeled? Husband decides how. Kids need new homeschool curriculum? Ask Dad what he want them to learn. It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend the book. Want something better and along the same lines? Try [[ASIN:1592767923 Smart Martha's Catholic Guide for Busy Moms]] or [[ASIN:B006ZEUAW8 Mrs. Meyer's Clean Home: No-Nonsense Advice That Will Inspire You to Clean Like the Dickens]].",negative

"I love Allison Weir's writing and have read several books. This novel kept me involved for several hours but I didn't think it wasn't as good as Katherine of Aragon. The author explains why. There are many letters written by Katherine but Anne's letters were destroyed. The correspondence and accounts ate generally negative. While Katherine's character is fleshed out in her book, Anne is a complete character. Her motives feel false and not a real person. She is written sympathetically in the beginning, then while with the King wishes terrible things, then at her death she apologizes for the all the bad things she did, supposedly making her sympathetic again. Anne Boleyn is a very important person in history but the novel doesn't capture her character. Good try though.",positive
"This book was extremely predictable; there was nothing new or exciting about it.  The writing style was good, but it moved so slowly.  It took me at least three tries to get into the book, and then halfway through I just wanted it to be over.  You can see the direction it's going in about 50 pages in, and I guessed the ending at about page 100.  I usually love to read books over and over, but I can't imagine plodding my way through this one again.  I wish I could have3 a refund.",negative
"East Coast Girls is about a group of childhood friends who reunite after being apart (as a whole group) for the last twelve years. The last time they were all together, they experienced a horrible life changing event. The story is told in alternating points of view, though for some reason, it's only told in 3 of the 4 girls' perspectives. Over the course of the reunion weekend, details of that awful night unfold through flashbacks and memories. Each girl carries a lot of emotional baggage. I didn't really like all of the girls, probably because I personally couldn't relate to any of them.<br />The pacing of the book was pretty good. I enjoyed reading it and found it to be entertaining.",positive

Mah's husband, a diplomat, lands a plum assignment to Paris: three years together to explore the city and its many boulangeries, cafes, and markets. An aspiring food writer, Ann is thrilled with the possibilities. They find an apartment and unpack the many boxes that have lived for years in storage (due to her husband's assignments, they have moved around frequently). But the unthinkable happens: her husband is called away to Iraq on a one-year unaccompanied tour, leaving Ann to navigate an unfamiliar language and city.<br /><br />During her year on her own, she traces the origin of various French specialties by heading straight for the source: AAAAA andouillette in Troyes, crepes in Brittany, cassoulet in Toulouse, pistou in Provence, boeuf Bourguignon in Burgundy. Beautifully written and with touches of humor, each chapter concludes with the star recipe that it focuses on. And yes, you'll find healthy sprinklings of wisdom from Julia throughout. There are fascinating cultural tidbits (and lots of dashes of local customs and lore) that serve to spice up the individual stories and portraits of individual regions.

"I bought this book for my 8 yr-old step-grandson for Christmas. I read the reviews and thought that since he loves cats and adventure stories this would be perfect for him. However, he gets in trouble at school for using phrases that he picks up that sound violent. This is NOT the book for him. The graphic nature in which the death of the coyote villain is planned and described is not suitable for children, ESPECIALLY not ones that are troubled. The coyote is definitely horrible, but I’m not sure that the way it plays out in the book is the best example for impressionable kiddos. My grandson’s parents have to be so careful as to what they expose him too and this book was such a mistake on my part. Going forward, I’m going to read everything first before I just hand him something based off of Amazon reviews. I may be a lone voice on this book, but if you don’t want to offer your children a smug, know-it-all, obnoxious, and unlikeable role model who takes a vigilante approach to whatever ill is encountered, then this book isn’t for you either. Some examples...<br />Pg. 56 “ … I will have to destroy Snarl on my own, and Max will most likely be lost. But I am certain of one thing: Snarl’s head will roll.”<br />Pg. 136 “I hear the thud of metal hitting flesh, and a yelp is followed by silence.

"What did I like about Wake? Well, it wasn't the same old vampire or angel story that we've all read 20 times by now. It was something new and different. It wasn't super obvious in its story development, so it kept a few surprises in there. Good character development, although a bit unbelievable in parts (more on that below).<br /><br />What I didn't like about Wake? Well, the name, for one. The title of the book has been used. [[ASIN:1416974474 Wake (Wake Series, Book 1)]] The character development was a bit unreal. The prettiest girl in a beach town has only had 1 boyfriend and is a down to earth driven type? Umm... okay- sure. A sister that is only 2 years older takes on a mothering role before her tweens of her barely younger sister? And she learns girl stuff from where? The older sister should have been much older if that is the role she was to play. There were also a few plot twists that were just not fully in the story before the twist, so it felt forced.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good read. Entertaining. Different. I'll be waiting for the rest of the series to come out.<br /><br />Parental blurb: Very, very little cursing. (I seriously remember maybe one word.) Kissing only. Yes, violence. Yes, gore. But neither are overly done.",positive
The book could have been cute. The writing was just too overthought. There were far too many central characters to keep the story moving for younger kids.

It could have used some massive simplifying.,negative

"There are 3 short stories in this collection. These are what nightmares are made of. The first one is about Raena who lives under water and is treated so badly by her master, Orlish. It is her job as a special seamstress to her master and when one of her suits causes a tragedy, she is punished. The second one is about a haunted house that is abandoned after the family is tragically slain there. When Grace is asked out by the school hottie, Brandon, she just can't say no to him. Even when he suggests that they double date with his friend Greg and his girlfriend Elizabeth and want to visit the house, Grace has this feeling in her gut that they shouldn't go,but doesn't want Brandon to think she's afraid so they meet the other couple there. After they walk into the house,Grace is sure she should have followed her instincts to save her from the horror in the house !!! This is the nightmare one lol. The last one is more like a mystery when people end up missing in a small town, and then later found dead with no clues to who the murderer is. The local police calls in a professional profiler to help with the case. When the FBI, joins in on the investigation, they doubt her ability to be able to help because she is blind.

But Mitch is keeping a big secret from Eleanor.<br /><br />I loved Eleanor and Mitch getting to know one another. It was super fun and I immediately liked them. They were so adorable and flirty. But when these two meet in person they sizzle! So if you want a story that’s going to make you happy, that’s entertaining with a heaping amount of steam and filled with a generous topping of romance, this is it. Left me satisfied and smiling!",positive
"The first pages have you assaulted by so many names that you are dizzy... Are all those names important? No. I was so confused as I wondered what importance, if any, were all these faceless names. Then 'Jade' (hmm, how many FBI agents are named Jade when compared to the same name of exotic dancers?). Anyway, she goes to her new position and we get more names! I guess I fell for the monthly 'Amazon Reads' again, choosing a most likely self-published story that I lost interest in by page 20. One easy tell about novice writers is that they choose such ridiculous names for their characters. And names are only important if these characters will continue on through the story.",negative
"I discovered Debbie Macomber through her [[ASIN:0373892136 Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove Cookbook]], which was in our small local library in Central Japan. After returning home from six months with no kitchen (and having spent the previous Christmas overseas), I was thrilled to see her Christmas cookbook, and made numerous dishes from it for my first Christmas back home with family and friends, including the three-cheese scalloped potatoes and numerous sweets (triple ginger chocolate chunk cookies, almond joy to the world, cappuccino snickerdoodles with mocha glaze). The only real miss was the scalloped potatoes, which turned out far too watery. The recipe calls for 3 cups whole milk but no flour or other thickener, and the starch from the potatoes wasn't enough to hold it together (the milk is simply heated before being poured over the potatoes and baked).<br /><br />The recipes include traditional favorites alongside international additions like Spanish tortilla, green pea hummus, Provencal tomatoes, and tzatziki dip, so you can mix and match influences if you so desire. Tucked between the recipes you'll find cute, easy decorating ideas and crafts. If you could wrap up the sights, smells, and tastes of everything wonderful about holiday season, it would look a lot like this! ""Debbie Macomber's Christmas"" would make a wonderful gift for family and friends, and it's also a great cookbook to cook from together as a family (some of the simpler recipes would be appropriate for young kitchen helpers).",positive
"If you know nothing about color space or dynamic range you won't know much more than basic information after reading this. It has some basic information that the author says he will repeat to help you retain it, and he does but the information was so basic that is was hardly worth repeating. Useful information was lacking for me though and I don't believe it should be titled 'Mastering' nor do I believe it provides much help in understanding exposure. I quick Google search for 'bit depth', 'color space' or 'JPEG vs RAW' will likely provide better technical information then this book and as the author states in this book, your camera's owners manual will provide you with the information you need to access and use the histogram. All I lost on this book was the price of a bag of donuts so for that I gave it a second star.",negative

"I am a former elementary school teacher and I am familiar with the Teacher Created Materials brand. I used to purchase some of their teaching materials when I had my own classroom. I have a 6 year old nephew who reads at a higher level. He's inquisitive and very interested in math. I thought this would be an excellent gift for him. The books are thin, but sturdy paper backs. They are full of colorful and interesting photographs. There are places in the book to answer mathematical questions. Each book has a glossary and answer key. I enjoyed reading each of these 10 titles and found them engaging as well as entertaining. They cover many different math topics such as perimeter, area, volume & mass, shapes, and much more without being stiff and dry. I do think they are priced a bit on the high end, but it is for a whole set of 10 books. Overall, this is a great set!",positive
"We are not trying Keto so much as we are trying to find more and better ways to use our inherited air fryer. I like the Keto angle though, it has brought up a number of good ideas.  Unfortunately a lot of the family is vegetarian so we are limited about most of the recipes (expected) but we knew this book had a vegetarian section and it lived up to our hopes.  We were immediately inspired to make buffalo cauiflower and it was an immediate hit. We are also excited to make eggplant lasagna once we can find decent eggplant... as well as frittatas, fritters, stuffed mushrooms.  This is great since mostly we have been french air frying sweet potatoes and potatoes and that is about it.<br /><br />The cookbook itself has a number of illustrations.  I wish all recipes had quality food photography with them, and this one has some, in fact more than most I have been looking at, but still falls well short of what I would like.  But the recipes are good, I feel inspired to get a lot more out of our air fryer, and as the meat eater in the family, I am a little jealous of a lot of the Keto options. All in all it is a good cookbook, and very good for our needs.",positive

"The Way We Fall by Megan Crewe is a pretty darn good read. Kaelyn, the main character, lives with her family on an island. The book is written as a journal or diary of sorts from Kaelyn to her former best friend who is no longer living on the island. Kaelyn is trying to make some positive life changes and open up a bit more when a virus hits the island. You follow the story as Kaelyn's world falls apart. You feel her hope and her despair along the way. It is definitely a worthwhile read. It could have been better. There could have been a little more attention to some of the details. Certain aspects of the story could have been a bit more dramatic. It felt a bit like Ms. Crewe was holding back a bit, perhaps for the sake of the intended audience (teens). But that holding back took a bit of the excitement out of the book. I felt the love interest in the book was a little bit forced. Who gets a boyfriend when everyone is dropping dead from a virus? The characters were well developed. The story felt complete. I liked it.<br /><br />Parental blurb since this is young adult fiction- violence, but not as graphic as it could have been. Some cursing. Mentions of homosexuality. That's about it. I don't have a recommended age, because that would really be up to you on this one.",positive

"3 Pandas Planting is a book about protecting the planet. It features a countdown, starting with 12 and going down to one and in each instance, the book depicts a number of animals that are engaged in some type of earth friendly activity. For example, 12 crocodiles are carpooling and 11 tigers are turning off faucets. The book continues with this theme all the way to the end when it shows one elephant that is simply enjoying the earth.<br /><br />This book is meant to serve as a reminder to kids that they need to do what they can to be good stewards of the planet. The book touches on different ways to make the earth a better place through conservation of energy, water, and resources. This is all fine and good, but 3 Pandas Planting is a little too basic to accomplish much. The drawings are nice, but all you get on each page is a group of animals and one simple sentence explaining what the animals are doing to protect mother earth. There is no explanation on how to do the action or how it helps. There is just a single sentence and that is it.<br /><br />3 Pandas Planting tries to redeem itself and its lack of information at the end of the book where it offers some family tips on ways to save energy, keep the air clean, conserve water, recycle, and reduce & reuse. There is even a final listing of earth- related events and their dates. This is nice, but why didn't the author try to integrate these tips on each page, in the main body of the book? It would have been much more effective to mention these tips along with each of the actions in the main section of the book. Most kids won't even bother reading this tip section at the end because it is more like an appendix than a part of the book.<br /><br />Teaching kids to recycle, conserve water, etc., are all good ideas and there are some great children's books for getting this message across. Unfortunately, 3 Pandas Planting isn't one of them. The book is weak on both creativity and content and its earth- saving tips at the end is still not enough to save it from mediocrity.",negative

If you paint on the shirt or glue the felt to them, then the shirts can't be decorated again.  Younger readers may need some adult help, as mentioned on the back of the kit.",positive

"Having been a vegetarian for over a decade, I am always on the lookout for new and unusual ideas to add into my lunch and dinner rotation. ""PNW Veg"" collects 100 recipes inspired by the Pacific Northwest, with nods to regional ingredients like fiddlehead ferns, sea beans, and stinging nettles. The style calls to mind Ottolenghi's blending of international influences; you'll find Hispanic, Korean,and Middle Eastern inspirations.<br /><br />A note of caution: if you do not have access to a good grocery store, a lot of these dishes may be out of your reach. Also, the flavor combinations may be a little unfamiliar for some (spiced parsnips with blue cheese yogurt sauce, artichokes with lavender-rosemary crumbs and miso butter).<br /><br />Personally, I loved the variety in the soups, salads, sides and mains, but I save these dishes for weekends and special occasions. I love the creative use of veggies in new and flavorful ways, and especially the whole grains and pasta chapter.<br /><br />I also appreciated that recipes are clearly marked as vegan and gluten-free in both the index and the recipes themselves.<br /><br />Verdict: If you are game for sometimes ""exotic"" flavor pairings and don't mind some lengthy prep times (I would call this ""vegetarian gourmet""), this is a great choice for elegant vegetarian dishes (especially for holidays or special occasions.)",positive

"This is a slightly quirky, dysfunctional family, mystery set in 1968 Laguna Beach California.  Matt Anthony is the strangely stable kid with a brother fighting in Vietnam, soon to come home, and an older sister Jazz who is still in high school.  At sixteen, he can drive his Mom's van but usually travels by bike to go fishing and precisely deliver papers for a little much needed cash.  His mother has a big drug problem, barely pays the rent waitressing in a pirate themed restaurant and is tuned out of her children's lives a lot of the time.  His father left long ago and contributes nothing.  He's politically right wing, very into guns and pretends in phone calls to his son that he's there for him, but he never is.  Matt and Jazz both do some work in an early version of a New Age bookstore and gallery.  This is the summer that his long time crush has a crush back at him but another girl, who attends meetings at the retreat occupying acres on a hill also catches his eye.  And along the way, Jazz disappears, the police say she's a runaway, odd factions in town seem to have unexpected connections, his mother moves the family to the part of town that is known for free living and drug use, and Matt's loyalties are all over the place, with one exception:  He knows his sister did not run away.  He knows she is being held somewhere against her will.  And he will do all he can to save her.  This is a cool pastiche of the era, with various points of view represented through  fairly quick sketches but sufficient and engrossing.  Matt is a great character.  Enjoyed.",positive

This book replaces intelligent rational conservatives with-which one (right or left-minded) can actually discuss things, with idiotic ""dittohead"" morons who spit out the rehashed opinions of such purile pundits.

"When I did have to stop reading this book over the past 48 hours, I could hardly wait to get back to it!  I enjoyed Melissa's memories about the different episodes. On reading about the ""May We Make Them Proud"" episode, I found it interesting that both Melissa and I agreed that if a mother was by her baby's cradle and a fire started, she would GRAB THE BABY (as she tried to point out to Landon during filming)!(That was a L.H. that I remember as being very ""dark"" and quite frightening,as I was 9 years old back in 1979).<br />  Anyway, this book was like a walk down memory lane in the 70's, with the songs that Melissa listened to, the clothing and hairstyles, and of course the memories about Little House! I liked the fact that the title was true to the book's contents. When I read ""Prairie Tale"" by Melissa Gilbert, I thought it would have many more details about her L.H. experiences, as the title suggests. I ended up forcing myself to finish it, after wading through the VERY sordid details of her many romances. Way too detailed, in my opinion! ""The Way I See It"" was not written as a tell-all book. Melissa came across to me as a rather shy, gentle person who wanted to share her memories of this particular period in her life with her fans. She seems to be a person I could sit across from and enjoy sharing 70's memories and ""mom stories"" with, since her son is exactly one year and nine days older than my son!<br />  I highly recommend this book to any Little House fan, especially those who grew up with the show in the 70's like I did. Great job, Melissa! I enjoyed your book thoroughly and will read it more than once, I guarantee!",positive
I couldn't get through this book. I wonder if Sandford even wrote it. I have enjoyed the Virgil Flowers books over the years but found this one disgusting.,negative
"It's hard to put my thoughts about this book into words.  I remember when the Wild Cards series first came out and the fun of stories about super-humans who were also often quite ""human"".<br /><br />I knew since the back cover writeup on this story suggested that it was ""inspired"" by the online RPG City of Heroes that there was a danger that it would have issues with character creation and development.  The fact that it was a multi-author effort also was something I was concerned about as the original Wild Cards would have wild variations in quality depending on which author wrote a particular chapter.<br /><br />This book affirmed all my fears, unfortunately.  Character development is sparce and by the time I got 150 pages in I realized that there wasn't a single character I cared about.  Usually I can find one, even a villian to be interested in, but here, I just wanted to see the story move on.<br /><br />The villians were effectively faceless goons in metal suits, which only added to the ""I really can't care about anyone."" attitude that built up.<br /><br />Finally I set the book down, and I know I will never pick it up.  Its just not worth the effort.",negative
"Author Zing Tsjeng’s background is in broadcast and online journalism (see the “Broadly.” Channel on Vice), which probably explains the weird typography in FORGOTTEN WOMEN: THE SCIENTISTS.  Throughout the text, short factual passages (maybe you could call them “sound bites”) are printed in type that is far larger than the type used for the text as a whole.  Presumably this is done to make the best “points” stand out, but in a printed book, it’s like reading a book that someone else has heavily highlighted.  It just doesn’t work.<br /><br />The book also gives the impression that the mini-biographies are researched and compiled almost entirely from online sources, which may or may not be true.  (Certainly the Bibliography supports that notion.)  Online research is all well and good, but not as accurate or scholarly as one would like to see in a book meant to educate and inspire young adult readers.<br /><br />I love the concept of this book--short biographies of little-known women who made significant contributions to the science of their times.  I also like the graphic illustrations very much.  But in the end, I wouldn’t choose this book as a gift for a young reader, female or male.<br /><br />The list of included women is useful for anyone interested in finding out more about “forgotten” female scientists (check the Table of Contents in “Look Inside This Book” for the list).  Apparently the list was created with help from Gina Luria Walker, Professor of Women’s Studies at the New School of New York City, and Director of The New Historia.",negative

"I loved this book! My only criticism (and the reason I gave it 4.5 stars and not 5) was having to follow five different characters and their stories simultaneously made it feel very stop and start. The chapters were short and sharp and each was left on a cliffhanger (which I loved), but because you then read four other characters' stories you lose any tension and momentum built up by the time you came back around. For example, I loved Christopher's storyline but by the time I then read Nick, Mandy, Jade, and Ellie's chapters and got back to Christopher, I had almost forgotten what had happened in his story and had to go back. This was the same for Nick's who was another great character. I think one of the characters could have easily been dropped from the story to make it flow better (maybe Mandy) but overall I loved the concept of this book, the punchy writing, and I cannot wait to see what Netflix did with it!",positive

"This is my first time reading a book by Kimberly Stuart and I enjoyed it. I am fascinated with reality TV, so I found that aspect of the book very interesting. I don't watch a lot of reality TV, but it's a fun plot line to read about. I especially liked the behind the scenes prospective. This is a cute, fluffy read and what I would classify as chick lit. The characters are well written, though maybe a bit unrealistic in my opinion. The book is very descriptive and does a good job of painting images of the pastry world. The pace was pretty steady, but there were times when I had difficulties staying engaged. Overall, I liked it and found it entertaining.  I would read something else by this author.",positive
"Some things about this book just don't work for me, I'll try to set them out, but even my complaints seem muddled, so be patient with me.<br /><br />1.  Unreliable narrator- Esther's 'voice' vascillates between a hyper, naive ten year old to a world weary, old before her time tween.  Which made it hard to form a vision of her.  My expectations for her character development were continuously smashed as she made strange decisions and acted foolishly on and off throughout the story.<br /><br />2.  Variants\Mutants -  These just did not work either, not as hermaphroditic hobbits, nor as peace loving, earth motherlike, farmers.  Whenever the variants entered the story I found my attention wandering; 'should I have another cup of coffee?  Is the itchy spot on my foot a wart?  I wonder what I did with my chinese jumprope?'  There's no credible reason for their inclusion in the story, they might as well have intruduced mutated hedgehogs or giant squid.<br /><br />3.  The worldbuilding - Some of the worldbuilding reminded me, in a distant way, of Enclave by Anne Aquirre, but the similarities ended as I tried to work out how people could survive for several generations in such bizarre circumstances.  Without food, 'cept for what they find, without even trying to grow anything.<br /><br />4.  The other characters, Skar, especially seem to exist just to add interesting background for Esther.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give this book a miss.",negative

"I have been on a reading binge of Mark Edwards books for the last week or so, and I have to say, I was beginning to think everything he wrote was gold, until this book. Out of all of the books I have read by this author, this one was surprisingly bland, disappointing and ridiculous. I couldn't even find redemption in liking the main character.<br /><br />I thought I'd get this review out of the way first, before reviewing the other works I've recently read by him. I thought this book was awful, but please take my advice and do not begin with this book. Read his other stuff first and you can see what a great author he truly is. I'm not sure what happened with this book--perhaps a good idea gone wrong, but it certainly wasn't for me. That being said, it will not stop me from highly recommending and enjoying his other books.",negative
"""The Professionals"" by Owen Laukkanan will appeal to many who enjoy the suspense and crime genres.  The novel is almost exclusively plot-driven, with little or no atmosphere, characterization, or psychological insight.  However, plot drives many novels of this kind, and they are wildly popular.  I predict that this novel will find a wide audience, too.<br /><br />The story begins as four college friends, unable to find well-paying jobs, turn to low-payout, high volume kidnappings of wealthy businessmen.  The kidnappings are solely about money; no violence is ever involved.  For two years, they move from ""job"" to ""job' until one day they kidnap a repellent man with mob connections through his wife.  For the first time, their carefully planned routine goes awry.  At the same time, the law, represented by State Investigator Kirk Stevens and FBI Agent Carla Windermere, is taking an interest in this kidnapping and others that are at first seemingly unrelated.  The bulk of the book concerns the efforts of the four young people to evade both the law and the mob.<br /><br />This novel is easy to read and moves along quickly.  At 370 pages, it has 93 chapters, many only two or three pages long.  I would classify this book as escapist reading.  There are many implausible situations that will leave readers wondering how this or anything even remotely like it could have happened in the real world.  The book will not satisfy fans of authors like P. D. James, but James Patterson fans will be happy for another writer to fill their bookshelves.  The author's note suggests that the he plans more books featuring Stevens and Windermere, so perhaps their characters will be more developed in later books.  They are likable people--maybe a made-for-TV movie is in the offing?",positive
"An Uncommon Honeymoon is another fun book in the Librarian Spy series by Susan Mann. I have read all three of the books in the series and they are all fast paced, exciting romances. My favorite is the first one, but this one is still enjoyable. The plot reminds me of the Mission Impossible movies with the addition of romance. The heroine in the series is a beautiful librarian, Quinn, who falls in love with a spy, James. This third one coincides with their honeymoon. They chase after drug smugglers and human traffickers. The chemistry between Quinn and James is amazing. There's some steamy romance and plenty of spy action. I really enjoyed all of the library tidbits and facts that flow throughout the series. I hope that there's another title in the series in the future.",positive
"Some books are meant to be published in hardback; this one certainly wasn't.  It reminded me of STAR TREK:  V (the one written and directed by Shatner); it's format would've been suitable for a tv movie, not a big screen.  This book, too, didn't need to be a hardback; it's a total waste of money.  In fact, it's even a waste of money at mass market paperback prices.",negative
"I was disappointed with this book because I expected more substance on how to cure cat behavioral problems.  Most of what was presented in the book was common sense.  The book also doesn't offer any in-depth case histories and therapy plans for cats with particular problems.<br /><br />I feel this book would be useful for someone who knows little about cats.  However, if you are familar with cats and their basic needs, this book doesn't offer much more insight than most people would know.  I expected more from a well-known behaviorist.<br /><br />If you are really looking for an in-depth book on pet behavior that is more useful, read Pam Johnson-Bennett's ""Psycho Kitty"" book.  I found it to be absolutely excellent.",negative

"I'm not sure if I missed the boat somehow, but I really didn't like this book.  As a translated novel from Dutch, I wondered if I missed something of a cultural nature?  The novellas are really a wandering tale of a young boy and his neighbor ""friends"" in their day to day young lives.  Their days are filled with cruelty and death to bugs and animals, bullying of those they deem less than them, and molestation by strange adults.  It seemed that the author was trying to show ""childhood"" as seen from the point of view of a child, but it seemed too dark and distracting to hold on to.  I didn't care much for any of the characters and was, in fact, disturbed about what the main characters might do as adults--was that the point?  If these ""children"" continue with experiences such as this, it made me wonder if it's trying to explain how exposure to the grime of life can really change the trajectory of a child's life?

Brutal ruthless psychopath killers who fed on the American Civil War, their story of butchery and torture stretching from 1864 to 1900 spreading carnage from Georgia to Chicago, Arizona, California, Canada and Oklahoma.<br /><br />A 5 star look at man at it's worst made too explicit and vivid for this reader who doesn't need the horror so lovingly depicted.",negative

"This is a lovely, depressing and highly readable book about the devastating loss experienced by a family when their older daughter Kathy dies just before she graduates from high school.  Espach writes it from the point of view of Sally, Kathy's younger sister.  Together, they shared confidences, particularly about Billy Barnes, Kathy's crush from fourth grade on.  Their parents were loving and had a good marriage and their life in a coastal town in Connecticut was picture perfect.  Each family member and, oddly, but for good reasons, Billy Barnes go through the next fifteen years experiencing this loss in different but deeply painful and life-changing ways.  Each is stuck on some aspect of the loss, the perfection gone, but life goes on, but what does life look like when it goes on?  This is also a love story between two sisters, the sisters and Billy Barnes, parents and children and husband and wife. Kathy is ever present in one way or another -- in dreams, in stories, in her casket, at her grave, as a storm.  The arc of the story is so perfectly drawn, the writing emotional and  sometimes funny, particularly when it comes to getting into the brain of a growing teen (Sally) and her romantic escapades and adventures with her  best friend Valerie.",positive
"An eleven-year-old girl and her sisters are traumatized by a murder which takes place at a convenience store in their neighborhood. Maggie actually becomes very OCD after this incident The story is told from her viewpoint.  She begins to repeat things in her head twice, count things and has to have the number even, checks constantly for the robber. Maggie thinks he is literally everywhere and will &#34;shoot her in the head or heart, any minute.&#34;<br />Overall Reaction: This book is disturbing. The description on Amazon was better than the book turned out to be. Maggie is portrayed as a child that is experiencing serious mental health issues. Since it's written in first-person, her anxieties and rituals overwhelm the story. The character development was also lacking. Each character has one trait pointed out about them, and what is revealed is not flattering. For example, the author hints at the mom being fat, the dad has skinny arms and is short; little sister has a ponytail she nervously chews on. The older sister is  portrayed as being only a very moody teenager; even friends are not written about in detail. I would best say the writer's style is rather blank and empty. This book left me feeling anxious.<br />One More Thing: Usually minor swear words don't bother me too much, particularly in Y.A, fiction. However, the F-Word is a huge turn-off for me, in life as well as in literature. This book had a child saying F-Off several times. Even though abbreviated with a hyphen, I found this very inappropriate, especially since this supposedly geared toward younger readers.",negative
"The recipient was very happy with her new coloring book. What I liked about: I chose this particular coloring book because so many have such full pages of tiny parts to color that can seem daunting. As someone who also colors, there are times you just want to finish a page in 10 minutes and not make it an all day affair. Who’s got time for that? Not me!",positive
Bought these for daughter (33 years old) who is recovering from a minor surgery.  She used to love to color as a child and I thought it might be fun.  She was thrilled.  And reports that it is soothing and quite calming.  She doesn't get a LOT of time to do it with 2 year old and 5 year old boys but looks forward to it when she can.

"Over the past decade, a curious new literary genre has emerged: that of the American writer seeking a bucolic existence in Europe. Such novels generally involve the writer in question purchasing a run-down villa, and then chronicling the restoration stone by stone. Frances Mayes's ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" set off an avalanche of similarly themed Tuscan memoirs, some more pompous than others, waxing poetic on the mystical quality of the Tuscan light, the sensual delights of Tuscan produce, etc.<br /><br />Enter The Reluctant Tuscan. Phil Doran was practically dragged to Tuscany from L.A. Although his wife has spent several years in Italy working as a sculptor, Phil has no desire to restore the crumbling heap that his wife purchased in a moment of ""inspiration."" Add to that feuding neighbors, an uncooperative bureaucracy, and Phil's fading career as a sitcom writer/producer, and at first glance you think, ""Under the Tuscan Sun Part V.""<br /><br />Don't be so quick to judge. Doran revitalizes the genre by a new twist: humor, and lots of it, in the biting style of Dave Barry (or travel host Rick Steves's witty observations). He pokes fun at Italian stereotypes of Americans and vice versa, of the rough-and-tumble country neighbors, the oddities of working in Hollywood, and his own transformation from stressed-out American yuppie to being in tune with his Tuscan side.<br /><br />The book is an enjoyable read, and just when you think that the next page is predictable, something comes along to shake up the story. Although Doran writes extensively about his career, I never found the story to descend into a self-centered memoir. There are valuable insights on marriage and relationships, the stress of being replaced by a younger generation at work, of learning a new language and way of life, and embracing the unknown. The novel's ultimate message is don't be afraid to take a chance...the journey is more important that the destination.",positive
"Parent's of younger children should review this gorgeously illustrated and engrossing story as by its nature, it's very sad and includes experiences that could be too much for some children.  It is incredible and my granddaughter's parents approved her request and her access.  She's on the young side for this but very much tuned in to conflict in the world, how it impacts ordinary people and that it is not pretty.  Very pleased with this incredible book.  Excellent introduction for older kids.  (NOTE:  While my granddaughter is 9, she reads at a very advanced level.  I think most fourth graders would find this moderately difficult to read, but cannot judge this as there was no question about this particular kid).",positive

"This is book 3 in the Jane Madison series. The bulk of the story has some moments where the description of what the author is talking about,has a tendency to drag on with too many details,but for the most part, I liked this book the most out of the 3. I say that because Jane has a very important decision to make in this one...she must choose between staying with the man she has finally fallen in love with,who accepts her for who she is..or to develop her magical powers.  While in the months that she is deciding,she is also too busy to keep practicing witchcraft,so it ends up fading...a lot.,the stones and crystals are turning to dust and the ink on the pages of her special books of spells is disappearing. David,her warder tells her she must use her powers to make them strong and come back to her...so she creates an anime to help her clean and restore her magical tools....but while she is performing her creative spell,she is distracted by the memory of her passionate night with David...and unknowingly creates a monster,...no problem there right? ,Lol until the anime runs away and can not be found.....the adventure in the book really picks up then..and the reason I think this is the best book so far is because of what happens after she finds out that the anime is missing...Jane truely comes into her own after the anime captures Neko,her familiar.!!  Lots of surprises in this one !",positive
"This an an attractive little book devoted to travel in Cancun and the Riviera Maya. I've been to Cancun and Cozumel a few times, and found the guide book to be a decent one. There are lots of colorful photographs which a fun to look at. It also has colored maps as well as a pull out one in the back. While it does give a lot of information about traveling, I found that it isn't very comprehensive and didn't include a lot of the activities that my family has done while in those areas. I guess that's what happens when you try to condense so much into such a small book. It is impossible to include everything! There's lot of good travel tips. The size makes it perfect for taking with you on your trip!",positive
"This book is perfect for those who do not want to plough through volume of data about a trip, but is looking for a quick review of key sights, best time to go, some maps and general transportation details and off we go!<br /><br />the trips vary from walking around a city to real rural locations where a car is a must.  We loved this book for all of the above features to plan for a long weekend trip: found it allows you to change the order of sight seeing point.  Some of the trips can be as long as 7 days, but there were many trips in the 2 days region.  it also gives you a section on which places are best to visit during the 4 seasons!  You could even cut one of the 7 day trip into 3 days just focusing on the sights that you really want to see; or even link two 2-day trip together as the book provides a number of trips within a local area.<br /><br />easy to carry and we love the freedom to roam as we wanted and this book gave us some focal points as we felt like doing.  Not too many rules!  So if you are like us, short of ideas for a little get away, dont want a travel book that tells you everything, but enough for you to discover things yourself then this is the reference book for you.  this is great if you are local in the NE as there were all these wonderful places that I never heard off and also great for those who are here for a vacation and want to get away from the usual tourist traps.",positive
"I vowed to never buy anything written by Baez, Casey, etc but I must admit, when I found the book on the bookshelf of my local Goodwill store for $.47 I couldn't resist temptation.  And shame on me. I should have saved that $.47 for something more meaningful. I should have known better. I remember when Judge Strickland said 'The truth and Ms. Anthony are strangers'. He should have included Baez in that statement. The book is far from believable. In fact, NOTHING about the book is believable. He spent years blaming innocent people of  being the real murderer of Caylee and in the end, decided to whip up a fake drowning story and slap in an accusation of molestation to go along with it. Anyone with a brain cell knows if any of  that had been true, there wouldn't have been a trial in the first place because he would have taken Casey to the police and had her tell the truth instead of sitting in jail for 3 years. As for the molestation accusation against George...well, the entire family is absolutely screwed up but this is very simple. If George had molested Caylee, the 'Mother of the Year' Casey wouldn't have let Caylee alone with him, EVER. After being the murder charges she and Bozo would have filed charges against George but they didn't. Baez says they 'didn't want to open another can of worms'. OK. So instead, they decided to allow a child predator to roam the streets, free to molest again? Please.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. I regret spending $.47 on this book but curiosity got the best of me. I AM pleased to inform you I found a very good use for the book when I finished it. My cat was just declawed. And yes, I lined his litterbox with the pages from the book!",negative
"Did women stop having heads after the seventies were over? It would have been nice if I had known that these were going to be vintage sort of representations before buying this assuming it would be rather non-stylised and generic.

"This is at most a nice book for beginners who have no real interest in performing analyses.  I can't understand the previous recommendation or how anybody could be hired to work professionally with Excel based on the meager knowledge that this book imparts.  There are only five pages on Pivot Tables, one of the most crucial topics to be covered.  Not only are macros not mentioned in the table of contents - they aren't even mentioned in the complete (for this book) index.  This is no more than an introduction to Excel 2007.  Granted it's a nicely done introduction, but it's at most a book which could be used as the basis for a half-semester class in Junior High School.  The second star was because the meager contents are well presented.

"I really wanted to like this book. The message that a parent will love their child no matter how frustrated they get was so touching, yet completely derailed by the mother's later unhealthy, obsessive exhibits of her love. Sneaking across town and into your grown child's house is not a healthy way to show love. Metaphor or not the author could have shown the steadfastness of parental love throughout time in a much better way.

"There are three main things I learned from this book. 1.) I apparently I do not know nearly as much about art and the artistic process as I thought I did. This author does an excellent job of explaining minute details about art, the industry and just about every aspect of the art world. 2.) What I do know is books and how they are written and whether they make the cut. 3.) Referring to the aforementioned statement on books, this one failed miserably.<br /><br />This book is as good as the title. I do not mean this in a positive light. If you have read the title, then you have essentially read the book. There is no real mystery, a total lack of intrigue and the writing is just bad. I wanted to love this book. I think with an editor who knew what they were doing and took their job seriously, this author would have been saved from the angry ruminations of hundreds of readers like me. This book made me think though, I will give it that. This book made me think about how we judge traditionally published authors VS. Those who have chosen to publish independently. Perhaps the divide is not so great as I once thought.",negative

"I was expecting a haunted house story or perhaps a missing person story with elements of a true scary book. The Ghost Notebooks is more focused on relationship issues between the couple and an odd internal angst instead of being a horror novel.<br /><br />I just didn't like either Nick or Hannah much and I was far more interested in the house and it's history than either of them. Yet, page after page was dragged down with reminiscing about old family dinners, dissatisfaction with career choices, and what was wrong with their relationship. The pacing is slow and nothing much actually happens for the first third of the book. I finally just stopped halfway through simply because I lost all interest.",negative

"Bette Robinson has found herself in quite the predicament. A graduate of Emory University (ok, I am an alum and just had to say that), working a corporate job that isn't making her happy, she trudges thru her life reading romance novels and spending time with her friends. So when she finally can't take it anymore, and walks out on her mundane job in investment banking, she decides to make some changes in her life. Determined to help her, her humorous uncle, finds her a job that will change her life. Having been raised by liberal parents, she always imagined working for a non-profit, so imagine her chagrin, when she starts working for one of the most popular PR firms in town, partying with the beautiful people and even pretending to be in a relationship with one of the most popular playboys known to the party scene. While Bette navigates her new life, she also finds a love interest in the most peculiar place, in the arms of an old friend. While jet setting around the world and partying with her not so usual crowd, Bette fights hard to continue supporting and protecting those she loves and holds dead. There are tons of comical characters, and a few plot twists and turns, but overall I found this story to be somewhat entertaining, but disjointed. There was something lacking, and the witty conversation and comical dialogue didn't cover that up. I don't know what it was that did not connect to me. It may have been that I didn't really care either way about Bette, or become invested in her character. She seemed a little one dimensional and sold out on her ideals a little quick. Either way, if you are interested in chick-lit, involving a world of lack-luster people....that mentions snippy gossip columnist, hip-celebrity haunts, the name dropping of certain celebrities, with some back stabbing friends and British bad-boys thrown in, this may be the book for you. But if you like a more comprehensive story read the ""Devil Wear Prada"".",negative

"Okay, first off, I had to think about this review long & hard before posting it.  Here goes...<br /><br />I feel cheated.  This book was so hyped up & I'm sure it had to do with the movie, which I refuse to see...but that's another story...<br /><br />I like the story.  I love the start & the end & for those that actually read the book...you know what I'm talking about.  For those that haven't read the book, I won't give it away.<br /><br />So what didn't I like?  SPOILER ALERT...stop here if you haven't read the book & plan to do so....<br /><br />I didn't like that the love story never really evolved.  It was just like Jake likes Marlena & she likes it...boom...now her husband knows they are in love.  WHAT?  When did that develop?  I needed more detail about their relationship & it just wasn't there.<br /><br />I did enjoy the history of the circus life & the life during the Depression.  I thought the Polish elephant was a riot.  I thought the old pictures from circus life back in this time period was a great addition to the book.<br /><br />But I really can't get over the story developement for Jake & Marlena.  Come on?  I can't be the only one who was expecting more on them??  Can I?<br /><br />Overall, the hype around this book was set too high.

"INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION LITERACY FOR STUDENTS is a textbook for computer research courses. It has decent flowcharts that describe the basic concepts of Internet and library research.  However, the text is incredibly wordy, and it talks down to the reader (especially true if the text is intended for college students or adults, as it seems to be).<br /><br />For example, from the first and second paragraphs of chapter 9, “Books”:  “Books spark the imagination.  They take us to worlds that no longer exist and others that are far, far away.… If books can broaden our minds, touch our hearts, and inspire our souls, they also can help us reach more immediate ends by informing our research.”  Much more generalization in the same vein follows, until the reader finally reaches the actual first topic (how to search a library's online catalog) at the bottom of the next page.<br /><br />I can't imagine assigning this textbook, expecting students to actually read the basic text.  Over and over, my attention wanders off as I try to read it.  There are some valuable observations here (e.g., avoiding reliance on Wikipedia if you're doing academic research (see chapter 13, “Web Pages”)), but digging those worthwhile nuggets out is far too much work.<br /><br />I was hoping for a good chapter on distinguishing between reliable and unreliable sources, but couldn't find anything useful.  In chapter 5, “Evaluate Sources”, the key questions it suggests you ask are:  “Is it relevant?”  “Is it reliable?” “Is it recent?”  This is supplemented by suggestions for critical evaluation of books, periodicals, and web pages, which conclude that scholarly sources, long-established book publishers, and library holdings are the most reliable sources. “Fake news” isn't even in the glossary or index.",negative

"I've read that John Ringo basically wrote the books in this series over the course of a few months of frantic writing.  I have not read the others, but this was a gritty description of commando style spy antics combined with almost BDSM sexual scenes.<br /><br />The military scenes and descriptions are solid.  However, they couldn't carry the story and the overall plot just felt a bit thin.  The sexual scenes felt almost forced at time and did not expand much upon the plot.  I could see a male reader wishing he was the main character with his almost mystical ability to pleasure a woman and win her adoration, but in a way the scenes detracted from the characters and their impact.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have read books 1 and 2 first so I could get more into the story, but I was able to figure out the basic personalities of most of hte characters, even if I did not know how they became friends and allies.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that will only be enjoyed by a select audience.  The sexual scenes will be considered offensive by some, but as always John Ringo's personal politics bleed into the politics of his writing.  As a writer he has a great talent, but his works can end up seeming a bit juvenile due to his style and politics.  This one fell into the juvenile category.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.  There are other better books out there.",negative

"The author of MURDER.COM is a retired New York City lawyer.  The series title character (Reuben Frost) is a retired New York City lawyer.  Perhaps this explains what is wrong with this novel:  the author is a lawyer first, a storyteller second.<br /><br />The novel is literate, but the story doesn't flow because the language is stiff and formal.  At the beginning at least, the plot is simplistic.  Frost's detective friend Bautista tells him about his new murder case (a woman with a Ladbroke apartments address). Frost wishes Bautista luck, then goes to dinner at the Four Seasons with a former client (Courtland).  Courtland chooses the excellently presented Steak Tartare;  Frost goes for Maryland Crab Cakes.  Courtland then asks Frost to look into the very, very recent disappearance of his adult daughter (an editor who just moved into the Ladbroke apartments).  The two women's names are different, but  guess what?  The murder victim is the client's daughter!  So Frost and Bautista team up to solve the murder.  Except for the descriptions of characters' backgrounds and expensive NYC restaurant dinners, this is basically all that happens in the first 40 pages.<br /><br />The novel literally put me to sleep every time I picked it up.  I even started it over again from the beginning, to be fair, but I just couldn't get into it, and finally I gave up.  Because I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting, and the plot too thin and obvious to keep me reading, I rate MURDER.COM at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative

"I was very high on this book at the start, however as I read, it fell more and more out of my favor. The historical stories and war time fiction were strong, but her characters are so weak, that I almost stopped reading it halfway through.  I ended up hating Bess and I doubt that was the author's intent.  Her selfishness is beyond belief for someone we are supposed to like, her sister's character is real enough but she is written out too soon and leaves us only with her spirit.  I would rather have read this book from the point of view of Tom. He seemed more real than any of the others.  The time period being what it was, the controlled environment of her childhood makes Bess's choices even harder to swallow.  I think she was supposed to be this headstrong girl with a mind of her own but she ended up seeming like a hurtful piece of selfishness.<br /><br />The under story, The struggle between nature as she is and nature harnessed for use was a wonderful storyline and again I was filled with disappointment over the lack of power to the story.  We are talking about Niagara Falls for pity's sake it should have some power to her words about the struggle to ""use"" it.  Fortunately I am done with the book and maybe the selfishness of Bess will be forgotten as well.",negative

"""It's a book!"" ""It's a game!""<br /><br />There is no story in this book. Just random pages with phrases written with numbers in the words.

It is over the heads of early readers and makes a completely lousy read aloud. But an older elementary child can read the book and then think of a few wumbers of his or her own.",positive
"Great travel book on France. I have been there twice already and got this book for next summer's trip to Toulouse. Not rating it as a 5 star as I don't see any out of the way places or exotic finds for the experienced traveler. This book is great, though, with pictures and maps and is great for a first time visitor to France. As expected, a lot of the book is dedicated to the Paris area. If you are planning a trip to Paris in the near future, this book is a must have for any tourist new to the area.",positive

The main reasons were to stop illegal drugs and the gangs/cartels that sell them.  It is not only from Mexico but from Central America as well.

It's well written and very engaging. I didn't want to put it down. I had a little difficulties keeping all of the characters straight when the time periods changed and I would have to go back and reread parts to figure out who was who, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. There's romance, drama, secrets, and more. I am looking forward to reading other books by this author.",positive

"The book's title is priceless.  The advice is a little disappointing--just your usual motivational platitudes, none of the quotes particularly memorable.  But each quote is accompanied by a mini-bio of the person quoted that gives the context, and also exposes the person's shallow, narrow-minded, or downright duplicitous nature.<br /><br />The Lance Armstrong quote doesn't disappoint, but quoting it here would give away too much.  (Isn't the subtitle the reason you're reading these reviews?)  A fairly typical quote is this one from someone else:  ""Southern charm is real.  It works . . . . I want people to feel good about bein' with me, and bein' nice to them makes it happen."" --Paula Deen<br /><br />The quotes are grouped in chapters:  Money Secrets (e.g., the People Who Wrote These Books Have No Money); Integrity!; the Complete Idiot's Guide to Leadership; Time Well Spent and a Life Well Lived; Relationships Until Death (or Domestic Violence or Crystal Meth and Gay Hookers Do Us Part); and Keep the Faith (Out of Wedlock), Baby.  The persons quoted include Bernie Madoff, Tiger Woods, Rush Limbaugh, Richard Nixon, Oscar Pistorius, and many others.<br /><br />GOOD ADVICE FROM BAD PEOPLE is a great book for bedtime, bathroom, or waiting-room reading--the mini-bios are quick and fun to read.  I rate this book at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive

"I love translated novels as you learn so much about the history and culture of the author.  This novel is no exception, but often the intended flow of the novel is often lost in translation.  So it is often tougher to read, but the completion often leaves you spell bound: worth the effort.  A beautiful book set in Hungary in the 18th century where the culture of one particular family is played out in the male linage where members crossed over to other religion for the sake of love, from rich to internment, of cultural and religious revolutions compounded.  Although many of the characters have a brief stay in the author's eye. You, none the less, get a glimpse of a moment in their life, be it their most tragic, their most humblest, joy mingled with lost or something just so out of the ordinary.  I have mention that this novel takes you through the human emotions and life's experiences like a high speed roller coaster.  Humor is peppered through out, but overall, a book of family legacies seen through the eyes of the male linage and history galore.",positive

"Like reading a collection of personal blogs, written without any soul or insight. What insight I did glean was that the author mixed in a social circle, and lived a lifestyle, that had little meaning or depth. I am sure that is not true. I chalk it up to this being a debut for the author and those memoir skills have not had a chance to be cultivated. I won't even touch on the socio-economic racial aspects of the story where the author strikes out on awareness or empathy.

I have all of Rendell's other books but I won't buy this one.  $15 is too much for a Kindle book.

"The title of this book led me to believe that this would be more [[ASIN:0060817097 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]] than a memoir about the author who marries and winds up with two stepchildren and a stepdog.  This memoir is 40% about the dog and 60% about the marriage.  Although I strongly feel that when you marry someone you accept them and their family (and yes that includes the dog) as a package deal, the author is of a different opinion when it comes to the dog. I really loved this book and the way Mireya tells her story. She is sometimes funny in describing the situation with Eddie the dog and her narrative is thought-provoking when describing the challenges she faced as a result of marrying someone who was already divorced and with a ""family"" of three. This was an easy read and just an overall enjoyable book.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this four stars is because the title is a bit misleading and led me to believe this was all about a dog.  However, it is a lot more than that but in a good way!",positive

"We have a couple vegetarians that will be moving off to college in a few years.  This book looked like a perfect way to start preparing them for life on their own.

"Harlequin Presents, at least the more recently pubbed, don't usually have this much backstory for the main characters.  The problem for me was that the female lead was such weird childlike woman/baby and as the story went on she didn't really change much.<br /><br /> Plus the part where she ran away from her father and lived in the forest with some dwarf miners, ahem, nice people, just was unbelievable.<br /><br />Rafe wasn't so much an alpha male as a weird sniffy man.  He smelled her presence?  Kinda gross.  I mean was he even around while she was locked in a tower by her mafia don daddy?  He should have known that she had some mental health issues, not the least of which was that she acted like she was twelve.<br /><br />The entire set up was sorta fairytale meets sexual fairytale and I didn't care for it.<br /><br />I've read better HP's and better Maisey Yates.  Did not like.  I will write more about this later.",negative
Just got the book today so I haven’t had a chance to use any recipes. But I’m disappointing that there’s no color photos and no nutritional information.

"This is an incredible true story and really draws you in, once you get into it.  The only problem I found with it is that the author goes into so much background on some of the characters that it can get a little tiresome.  Get on with the story already!  It takes 4 chapters just to get to the plane crash.  Then after the tale real starts to unfold, there are one or two digressions into backgrounds of other people involved.  There was one person who I have yet to figure out how he fits into the story, even though the author devotes almost a full chapter to that person.  Other than this one shortcoming of the book, the story absolutely pulls you in and you can't wait to find out how it is going to end.  You never lose interest, even with the digressions into character backgrounds.  An adventure story in the truest sense of the word and well worth reading.  Never boring; just a bit tedious at times when you want things to move faster.",positive
"THE GUILTY DEAD (Monkeewrench #9) is a fast, enjoyable, relaxing read.  I’d call it a “cozy police procedural”, because it chronicles a complex murder/anti-terrorist investigation by Minnesota police and the Monkeewrench software team, but focuses on the characters’ comfortable, familiar, joking personal relationships.<br /><br />In the novel, an FBI agent (Dahl) approaches the Monkeewrench outfit (Harley, Grace, Annie, Roadrunner), seeking software to automate the interpretation of metadata (online chatter) intercepted from terrorist suspects.  Monkeewrench has just the ticket—a beta program in development, no current buyer—and the program immediately detects an imminent bomb threat against Minneapolis City Hall.<br /><br />The federal anti-terrorist operation turns out to be interwoven with a local police investigation by detectives Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth into the double murder of a wealthy local philanthropist (Norwood) and a freelance photographer (Stenson).  The murders are staged as a suicide and a hiking accident, but the police aren’t fooled for long.  A single bit of information supplied by Norwood’s daughter—the first name of Norwood’s personal private investigator—is the key that unlocks the whole case.  The killer’s motive is tied up with the long-ago murder of a pregnant 14-year-old girl.<br /><br />The plot is twisty and interesting, though it’s totally predictable that Monkeewrench’s very pregnant Grace will be delivering the baby (Magozzi is the father) in the middle of a major terrorist bombing attack.  The writing is good, the characters are well-developed, and the novel works fine as a standalone.",positive
"Please note that my review is based on the ARC and I am not sure that the last few chapters were included as the dialogue ended abruptly and I was expected more stories to be told than the ones that were in the book.<br /><br />None-the-less, the novel is premised on a group of nine individuals who were unfortunate enough to be trapped in the basement of a building after an earth quake on the west coast, that much you were told.  To past the time and to take everyone's mind of the situation, each person had to tell a story of 'one amazing thing' that happened in their life.  The preamble into the novel was a little disconnected for me; but I loved the individual stories that were told in the ARC - very well expressed and I was emotional involved with the characters.  I only wished the preamble into the start of the novel was as eloquently written.  I am going to have to get the final and published copy to finish reading the rest of the stories - they were very well written with each of the characters in mind: teaching us a lot of life lessons where some characters only started their own healing once they told their story.  Each story that was told was realistic enough and life like enough for me to understand the life lesson.  the stories were beautiful.",positive
"Within the first dozen pages of this bloated novel I was wondering if there was an editor that was brave enough to tell Mr. Carter that this book needed to be pared down.<br />Too many repeated thoughts, too many unnecessary details.  This book should be a must read for every aspiring mystery writer as to what NOT to do when writing a mystery novel!  DON'T make it wordy, DON'T bring in characters that are minor yet you flesh them out in long lengthy detail and DON'T feel the need to describe rooms the characters are in down the way the curtains look!<br />What was Stephan Carter thinking?  This was not one of his law school class lectures- this was a murder mystery novel!  We also get the ideal you know a lot of big words- a LOT of them.<br />The only reason I finished the book was my determination I would not allow it to defeat me.  This was one tough, grueling read when the purpose of reading is to enlighten, entertain and relax.  I felt very little enlightenment, the entertainment was below par and I was too aggravated by Mr. Carter's lecturing style of writing to relax so I could enjoy the book.<br />And the characters?  I defy anyone to find any positive characteristics of any character in this book.<br />This book was an obvious success so my negative review won't amount to much.  I believe he is due to deliver his next novel next year- I am hoping his editor and publisher have taken him aside and warned him another 670-plus page mystery will not necessarily fly no matter how many big time mystery authors praise it (which a few share the same agent as Carter does).",negative

When the guy goes to the shack and meets God (a black woman), I thought... that's interesting... I read a little further and it just went from bad to worse.

"I was disappointed in this book. The actual content was pretty thin, and not very well written. Chapter 1 is a complete waste of time, and actually spends pages explaining what client/server means, what the Web is, and other things that are patently obvious to the supposed audience for this material. I found myself turning to the front to see if this book was written in 1997! You then get nine fairly short chapters with instructions on how to hack a website, more or less; followed by 50 pages of useless padding in the appendices including: an unrelated article co-authored by Whittaker for the IEEE, a detailed list of all the bugs present in their ""sample application,"" and then descriptions of their recommended tools, all of which can easily be found on the Web without paying $22 for this book.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, there are many typos and other problems like incorrect illustrations, making the reader wonder if Addison-Wesley even employs a copy editor. Furthermore, I felt this book was inaccurately named and described. It's really more about rudimentary hacking and protecting your web application against hackers than web quality or web testing. A beginning web developer might do well to read this as a primer on how to create sites and applications with basic security, but as an experienced tester it was of limited use to me.",negative

"I ordered this book over one year ago because of the rave reviews.  I tried two recipes in it.  The lemon pound cake was dense, too lemony and just all around not to my or my boyfriend's liking.  The vanilla cupcakes were so, so.  I make exceptional desserts from recipes in other books and articles and people have raved about them. I also follow instructions precisely.  However, in this case I know that the recipes are not good (at least to me) and the baker is not the problem.  I guess I just don't have a taste for the recipes in this book. I am almost afraid to try another recipe because the two others have been so disappointing.<br /><br />Perhaps this book is for someone who has different tastes from the norm.

"Ocean Girl was a family-friendly Australian TV show that lasted for four seasons, although only three seasons were shown in the United States. This novel came out after the first season premiered, and it perfectly captures  the mystery, excitement and wonder of Ocean Girl. Much of the flavour of  the series and its characters has been captured, although translating the  magnificent visuals of the Daintree rainforest does not fare as well.  Still, author Peter Hepworth makes a brave attempt. An example:<br />""Snow  white sands curved out of sight on either side. Beyond the beach great  strands of rainforest trees grew thick and tall, their trunks interlaced  with vines and creepers. Brilliantly coloured birds flashed from branch to  branch and butterflies the size of bread-and-butter plates flitted through  the air. They made their way inland, Neri leading the way. Each turn of the  track revealed new sights. Dripping clusters of bright tropical flowers.  Little marsupials who sat up on their hind legs like tiny kangaroos and  watched them pass. Huge emerald tree frogs with golden eyes.""<br />Ocean Girl  is an excellent companion to an amazing New Age TV series. Neri's story  will whisk you away to an isolated island paradise and a mysterious past.  Once you start reading this you won't be able to put it down!",positive

"I can't believe how terrible this book was! The characters from top to bottom are total cliches. Think of any stereotype one may associate with the state of Texas and you will undoubtedly find it here. The characters come across as caricatures  of people; the MC in particular, with his next to super Ranger bad-assedness, is an obnoxious jerk. He's irresistibly handsome, an outstanding singer/guitarist, has catlike reflexes, and is only slightly slower than the fastest gunman in the world EVER who just so happened to train him. All the ladies love him almost as much as he loves himself, although he's only able to grace one of these spectacular beauties with his awesome manliness at a time. I figured out the killer not far into the book; the few efforts to lead readers down false trails are pretty lackluster. After everything is said and done, I'm left wondering what in the world happened to JP's great stories? I'm actually embarrassed FOR him! I'm even more embarrassed for the dedicated, hardworking men and women of the Texas Rangers who must be mortified to find themselves even loosely associated with this silly pap! The one positive that I can say about the whole experience is that I didn't buy it. I waited FOREVER to borrow a copy from my library, and can wholeheartedly state that it wasn't worth the wait.

"DKFINDOUT! CODING is mostly a collection of factoids about early computers (e.g., Babbage’s Difference Engine), programmers and inventors (e.g., Steve Jobs, Bill Gates), elementary coding programs (e.g., Scratch), apps (e.g., smartphones in action), gaming (e.g., virtual reality), and the like.

I’m an information junkie, but the presentation here is so shallow, there is very little actual knowledge imparted.<br /><br />I think the book is pretty useless for increasing a child’s programming know-how, as promised in the advertising.

"Full of very colorful illustrations and easy to read type.  Starts with the basics of Windows 8 and covers many different topics.  If you go through the whole book, you should be somewhat of a Windows 8 expert.  Starts very basic and mentions things that are helpful even if you never used a computer before.  Even with very basic information, it doesn't feel like it is ""dumbed-down"", so even those who have used Windows for years will still be able to make good use of the book to understand how Windows 8 works and how different it is than prior versions.  The book probably was written from early releases or a BETA version, as it talks about things you can do with Media Center (such as playing a DVD).  From what I know, Media Center was not initially part of the Win 8 release and is a separate add-on.  I believe Media Center may be included now, as least in the downloaded Win 8 version, but I am not sure it installs automatically; the book makes it sound as if it is an integrated part of Win 8.  Since I don't actually have Windows 8 yet, I couldn't verify the accuracy of other information in the book.  I got the book thinking I was going to upgrade one of my computers, but then found out the hardware can't handle a Win 8 upgrade.  The only real problem I have with the book is that it won't stay open by itself so that you can refer back and forth from computer to book or book to computer. A spiral binding would have been preferable.  Other than a few possible inaccuracies and the problem with the binding, I really think you will like this book.  Has a good index in the back.  Total of 340 pages, packed with information on how to get up and running with Windows 8.  Save the cost of a training course and buy the book.  I believe anyone can learn Windows 8 from this book.  Copious illustrations and numbered steps make the book easy to follow and make it fun to learn.",positive
"Although a few select of the stories are interesting in this book, the entirety fails to caputre the attention I believe the author is trying to make.

The main characters were described well, but some of the others who were probably introduced in the other titles, were not described enough for me which led to my confusion with them. I liked the main characters well enough, but I did feel that Liz was a little weak sometimes. The plot is a familiar one - boy falls in love with best friend's little sister,  but best friend would not approve, so the two sneak around and try to fight the feelings that they have.There's humor, romance, camping/outdoors, and a little bit of heat.  Overall, I did find it entertaining and I did enjoy it.",positive

"I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the book but don't think I can make it any further. The lack of simple proof reading is amazing to me, especially after reading the author's blogs.

"I used Frommer's Paris 2012 as my primary source for planning my two free days in Paris, and it made for headache-free navigation of the metro and various sites. Unlike Frommer's Day-by-Day France guide, the Frommer's Paris 2012 guide is clearly laid out in an uncluttered, easy-to-read format that will make planning your next trip to the City of Light a breeze. From the handy list of maps to its handy suggested itineraries (the most unforgettable travel experiences, the best local neighborhoods, the best neighborhoods for getting lost, etc.), you can quickly make a list of your top destinations and get an idea of location, price, and opening hours at a glance. There are detailed walking tours for the various neighborhoods, great maps, and many sidebars giving additional info on monuments, locations, etc. You'll find a detailed guide to shopping in Paris, including the expected fashion and parfum shops as well as housewares, crystal, souvenirs, and stationary.<br /><br />There are also numerous lodging suggestions by location and price point, and suggested day trips out of Paris that include options many other books gloss over (the prerequisite Versailles, Chartres, Disneyland Paris and Giverny, as well as Auvers-sur-Oise, Fontainbleau, and Vaux Le Vicomte). The transportation section is also quite good, giving a solid overview of the metro/RER trains, on foot, bicycle and boat. There's a very servicable guide to French phrases, a pull-out map, and a great metro guide inside the back cover. Of particular interest for families traveling with young children, you'll find many suggestions for kid-friendly dining and museum experiences.<br /><br />This is a great (and compact!) guide to the City of Light, and I highly recommend it for planning your trip to Paris and environs.",positive
"A friend who is as avid a reader of fantasy as I am recommended this book with great enthusiasm. I have to say, I am now a little dubious of his potential to recommend me books in the future.<br />This book is very predictable. In fact, it's so predictable, that I found myself waiting for the twist within a twist to slap me in the face, because the truth behind the lies in the book is so obvious. It never came. Apparently, I was actually supposed to be fooled.<br />If you can't guess the ending of the book and spoil the &quot;suprise&quot; for yourself very early on, then who knows - you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, you'll probably feel as if you must have read this somewhere before in a past life... (it can't possibly be that obvious, can it?)",negative
"Yet another flimsy mish mash of a Jacobite-exile time-traversing tale.  Ms Kearsley seems to only have one story, set in one pair of time frames, that she reheats for each book.

"This is a stunning and large hardcover book designed for the bride and groom-to-be to guide them in styling their wedding. The first part of the book goes over wedding basics from flowers, stationery, dress basics, picking a venue date, etc. The second part provides ideas for the six wedding styles of romantic, lavish, modern, elegant, rustic, and vintage.<br /><br />As I was reading through this, I like the questions proposed that allows the bride and groom to decide what type of wedding they are looking for. This books entices one to dream and provides reasons for hiring a pro, deciding what type of calligraphy one might want on their invitations, etc. Obviously, this is mostly for people who have money to spend or at least what to dream what they would do with it if they had it. It is less useful for those spending less than $10,000 on a wedding.<br /><br />The only big negative is that some of the text in this lovely volume is written in white letters over pale pink or medium pinkish letters over pale pink making it very hard to read those sections--especially for my aging eyes. In addition, the front cover of my book was creased which distorted the word ""wedding"" as can be seen in one of my photos. It is mainly for these two reasons I took off one star. Other than this, this coffee table wedding book is just gorgeous and contains lots to consider before planning one's big day.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/4/2020 - I gave this to my upstairs neighbor who is a bride-to-be and she said she likes the way this book is laid out. She said this is very nicely done.",positive

"This book was so slow paced I could barely finish it, and when there was a part that was fast it was done so quick I didn't understand at all.  It was really hard to read and the characters were hard to get into. The emotions were confusing and it felt fake. Some of the characters were REALLY annoying and I winced whenever I read their name. It also tended to stray from the subject quite a lot. But there were a few things I liked about this book. A few of the characters were admirable and some of the points they touched on in the story were important.",negative

Thank you Brian for taking the risk.,positive
"This is a well-written account of an often overlooked, but vital aspect of warfare - Psychological Operations, or PSYOP. The author - a PSYOP soldier - spent 9 months with a small PSYOP team which often worked with US Special Forces teams in southern Afghanistan.  The team traveled the desolate ""moonlike"" landscape to reach the most isolated people and villages in an effort to ""win hearts and minds"" by assessing their basic human needs, helping organize the local leaders, and letting them know about the changes that were taking place across the country. They did this through face-to-face meetings, printed leaflets and newspapers, and solar-powered radios which they passed out to the villagers. To say such efforts are purely ""propaganda"" is to do these teams a disservice. They truly get up and personal with the local population in an effort to change things for the better. This book is a MUST READ for anyone interested in how the US is conducting the war on terrorism in small remote areas of the world. But hey, don't just take my word for it - READ THIS BOOK!",positive

"First time novelist Charles French proves himself a canny storyteller, shifting time frames and geographic locations, but never losing sight of his central plot and always building dramatic tension.  The action is character-driven, and what a colorful and well-drawn group of characters he has created.  Maledicus is subtitled The Investigative Paranormal Society, Book One.  I'm already looking forward to Book Two.  Docked one star for the small typeface (kind of tough on these tired eyes) and too many typos.",positive
"Costa Rica is a destination that my family has seriously been considering. And now after reading through this guide book, we're even more excited about going there. The book is a good sized travel book. It's an average book size not a pocket size. The pages are not as high quality as some travel guides, but they are colorful and chock full of information. There are plenty of maps, photos and tips all focused on Costa Rica. There's a pull out map in the back that's made of a sturdier glossy paper. While no single guide book can contain everything, this does cover a lot.",positive

"Most of the books in the official ITIL series are required reading if you are implementing or pursuing ITIL certification. This one can, in my opinion, be safely ignored.<br />The key theme of the book is promotion of the ITIL and its benefits, and a high-level overview of implementation issues.  The areas covered include: describing the ITIL vision, helping you to determine your 'As Is' posture and your 'To Be' per the ITIL.<br />It also provides a roadmap to get from 'As Is' to 'To Be', checkpoints, and advice on how to maintain momentum during the implementation. This guide also gives an example cost-benefit analysis supporting for service management process implementation, a process maturity framework, and a glossary of terms.<br />A more detailed book that will easily supplant this one is &quot;IT Service Management: An Introduction&quot; (ISBN 9080671347).  It contains all of the information that this book provides, plus an in-depth look at each of the ITIL's key process areas, how they relate to one another, and better implementation advice.",negative
"Don't want to include any spoilers, but there's a death early in the book, which is the mystery, so I guess any reader would expect a death. The BIG problem was the cause of death, and how even the police who investigate rule the death a suicide. I stopped reading the book at that point.<br />Then I was traveling and this was about the only thing to read, so I continued. Later in the book, the author ramps up the tension when a woman goes missing. Her friends get all concerned about her and call her several times. Uhhh, wouldn't someone think of going to her home to see if she's okay? Guess not. It felt like the author just needed to add some action and stuck this in.",negative

I like where this book is going with its characters,but I find Deanna to be a little rude and conceted In this one,which I didn't care for...but that being said,I loved how things turned out towards the end. The real killer was a surprise. Heading off to read the next book in this series now.",positive
"This is an easy to read book that I consider to be light and fluffy. It's a story about friendship and the changes that have occurred over the years. The characters are a little flat and could use a little more depth, but they're definitely tolerable and the story overall was enjoyable. There are some great descriptions about the seaside area. This would make a good beach read.",positive
"Full disclosure: I didn't even come close to finishing this book. After the slog of the second book, I just couldn't keep with it. The author leaves you too hopeless to carry on.<br /><br />By 10% I was skimming.<br />By 16% I gave up.<br />So this is my review of 16% of the third book.<br /><br />Like my second review, how many times can an author say the word ""bleeding"" in a book? 120. ""Skies""? 135! ""Hells""? 118. For heaven's sake, get some new curses into your vocabulary or maybe don't use them as often?<br /><br />As for the story, Helene--the best character--has been ruined beyond repair. The despair and torment of the second book had no sign of alleviating in the third. I slogged through the second depressing book in hopes that the third would be better--but so far no dice.<br /><br />I stopped caring about the rest of the characters because there simply was no reason to care about them anymore. Elias's story line came to a screeching halt in the second book and in the third he's a whiny boy who complains about the deal he made--when he was clearly forewarned about the consequences of the vow. What happened? He used to be a strong character with integrity. And Laia is just plain annoying as she always has been.<br /><br />From the sounds of the reviews I've read of this third book, I'm making the right choice in not finishing it. Apparently it doesn't get better--ever. Maybe when her 4th book comes out, but I'll never find out because she drove this reader away and probably many more. Way to go, author. Next time don't write such a depressing series.",negative

Lacking anything better to read I picked this one up and found it to be the worst one yet.  Marmee wasn't scary because all she did was give Anita an excuse to screw more men and the other bad guys didn't enter the story until nearly the end.  In other words very little action.<br /><br />I have never read this series for the sex, I enjoyed the action.  It was nice to see a strong female character.  Anita is no longer strong, just sex starved.",negative

Our family burned through the Wings of Fire series so this one sounded like a sure hit.  And for our daughter it kind of was. But the boys were less excited about it.  Usually I read things like this with the kids as a shared experience but the book was lost before it got back to me.  The basic criticism was not enough dragons versus our daughter who said it was great and she loved that there was so many dragons in it.  She was 11 when reading the book so perhaps her newly teenaged sons have outgrown it.  Both sides said it deserved 4 stars.,positive

"In this book, you'll find a futuristic America ruled militantly by a moralistic militia. No more democracy. Full force police state. The main character Ember is transported to a rehabilition facility. Rehabilitation for what? Being born out of wedlock. She becomes a ward of the new government.<br /><br />I do wish the book moved a bit faster. It did drag a bit in some places. And I won't spoil the ending, but you'll see it coming way before you get there. You'll want to keep reading to know how Ember responds. The characters feel so real. I only wish Ms. Simmons would have delved into a few more details. I'd like to know more about the Sisters and the President. I'd like to know more about the attacks that brought about the police state. I'd like to know more about the Resistance. I'd like to know more about the Moral Militia- drafting procedures, training, etc.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading it. If I had to compare it to other books, I'd lump it in with Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, and Matched. If you're a fan of any of those, give this one a read.<br /><br />This is a good read. I guess since this is a young adult book, I'll give my usual parental blurb. References to sex outside of marriage, violence, suicide, andrape is alluded to. No bad language. Nothing graphic, only kissing. I'd say it is pretty safe for the 13 and over crowd.",positive

"I purchased my copy from a street fair in Atlanta, Indiana where the author had a stand and was selling copies of his book. The cover initially caught my eye as it’s quite spectacular and after speaking with the author and reading some of the opening chapter, I knew I wouldn’t be walking away without purchasing a copy.<br /><br />Brothers of War is gripping from the get go and will keep you in its grip until the very last page. A great work of historical fiction that doesn’t get bogged down by endless description (which has put me off a lot of historical fiction in the past). The writing is sharp and snappy and because of this, it has a great momentum to the story and plays out like a movie in your head as you read it.<br /><br />This book really does come across as a labour of love by the author and it’s evident that he has a deep knowledge and passion for this turbulent time period in American history. All in all this is a great book with tangible characters, an atmospheric storyline and one that restored my love of historical fiction. A solid five star read.<br /><br />Bravo Mr Eisenhut!<br /><br />⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",positive

"Canadian cops infiltrate Muslim terrorist cell which has been planning explosions in Canada. The is internal rancor in the police ranks - lots of it. Complex relationships with stiff dialogue. Lots of glimpses of the Muslim community, all very distasteful to me - racist reaction, but not an engrossing or entertaining read. Touches on the oppression of women. The hero has many strikes against him with a grim ineffectual assignment, but of course he is the hero so he gets more involved.<br /><br />Not for me. However the first book got rave reviews so I may try that:<br /><br />THE UNQUIET DEAD Despite their many differences, Detective Rachel Getty trusts her boss, Esa Khattak, implicitly. But she's still uneasy at Khattak's tight-lipped secrecy when he asks her to look into Christopher Drayton's death. Drayton's apparently accidental fall from a cliff doesn't seem to warrant a police investigation, particularly not from Rachel and Khattak's team, which handles minority-sensitive cases. But when she learns that Drayton may have been living under an assumed name, Rachel begins to understand why Khattak is tip-toeing around this case. It soon comes to light that Drayton may have been a war criminal with ties to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995. If that's true, any number of people might have had reason to help Drayton to his death, and a murder investigation could have far-reaching ripples throughout the community. But as Rachel and Khattak dig deeper into the life and death of Christopher Drayton, every question seems to lead only to more questions, with no easy answers. Had the specters of Srebrenica returned to haunt Drayton at the end, or had he been keeping secrets of an entirely different nature? Or, after all, did a man just fall to his death from the Bluffs? In her spellbinding debut The Unquiet Dead, Ausma Zehanat Khan has written a complex and provocative story of loss, redemption, and the cost of justice that will linger with readers long after turning the final page.",negative
"I read this after it was recommended by a friend. I thought it was fast paced & interesting. I'm not a big fan of &#34;amnesia&#34; murder stories because it's all too convenient. It's also frustrating! The chapters are written in different point of views. Not only do you have to pay attention to which character is narrating the chapter, but what the date is for that chapter, too. I also found it sad that I didn't like any of the characters. Every time I thought that maybe a character was okay, something would occur that would change my mind. All of the main characters had some kind of mental health issue. It did manage to hold my interest and I didn't want to stop reading. It was suspenseful and entertaining.",positive

"I am amazed and baffled that such good writers who have the successful series going on with their truly grand character(Agent Pandergast), can come up with such lackluster book. And to make things worse.. they are trying to introduce a new character/series. I thought that Gideon would be introduced at such a grand level that people will forget agent Pandergast and he will become a thing of the past.<br />I think here lies a lesson for P/C, ""stick with Pendergast!"", as thats what they do best. I don't think I am alone here where I feel that we just can't get enough of Pandergast. I also think that the reason there is an overwhelmingly negative response to their introductory new series is for another reason as well, the fans don't want to share their love of agent Pandergast and they don't want the writers to waste half of their energies and time writing this series-- but they want the whole attention to be given to Pandergast. I think Mr. Gideon Crew will keep getting this ""step brother"" treatment.<br />If someone reading this hasn't started that(Pandergast)series, then that's what they should do instead of buying this book.",negative

Lizzie Velasquez is a motivational speaker with a rare congenital disease that has resulted in immense ridicule and cruelty in her young life. Her book is a compilation of the importance of kindness interspersed with various tidbits of her own story. The intention of this book is to teach others not to bully someone else just because they are different. Her other intention is to instill a sense of acceptance of oneself and to show that one can be happy despite their circumstances.<br /><br />This is a lighthearted read and I enjoyed it.  I believe in her message immensely but that message was conveyed in a &#34;matter of fact&#34;  style. I truly feel that if there were more depth of emotion infused into this book her message would be so much more impactful.,positive
"This is my first experience with grayscale coloring. As far as the coloring book goes, the paper quality is adequate. The images are okay - some are definitely clearer than others. It's hard to tell if some of them are blurry or if it's the result of the creature's scales, but some of the images have a pixelated look to them. I think the whole concept of grayscale coloring is neat. I just used colored pencils for my first attempt. It was alright, but I didn't have the results that I was hoping for. I plan to play around with other mediums. I think something that is blendable will be good.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"Written in epistolary form, this text is a 19th-century Danish schoolteacher’s actual letters back home to his parents detailing his life in St Croix.  I would not consider it a full-fledged book but rather a short story length wise. However, the scope of this works seems much more epic. It offers an engaging, firsthand account of that period on the island. For example, he goes into lush detail describing the fruits and plants of the island, the revelry of Carnival, and more mundane matters like the expensive cost of living on the island even in the mid-1800s.  Full of the excitement of a youth looking to make his way in the world, and the sorrow of the inevitable sad hand of fate all set against the alluring backdrop of a tropical island, this work is a must for those interested in the history of St. Croix.",positive

"While the Amazon title doesn't promise this, the cover of the book says these are reusable stickers.<br /><br />Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store because I suggested another reusable sticker book (our son loves the Melissa and Doug Reusable Sticker Book... link below). These stickers are only reusable in the sense that they don't stick well the first time, so you can pull them up and relay them once or twice more. After that, they loose all stickiness.<br /><br />So beyond the fact that it isn't reusable at all, I also feel like she got ripped off. Had there been more stickers maybe it wouldn't have been so bad But $6 for 75 non-sticky stickers feels like a waste of money to me. There are only 4 pages of stickers.  Many of the train cars are exactly the same, just different colors.<br /><br />Go for the M&D versions, it's the same price and vinyl, so truly reusable.  http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Habitats-Reusable-Sticker/dp/B004PBN9BC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358903299&sr=8-1&keywords=reusable+sticker<br /><br />If your looking for just stickers, I recommend the Thomas Sticker Express (Super Stickerific) which has 700+ stickers which are high quality.

"Unlike some of these reviewers, I forced myself to read on to the end because I thought it would have to get better.  It didn't.  I just did not enjoy reading about this man who wastes all his gifts and opportunities, then goes on for years wallowing in self pity.  His whining seriously reminded me of what you hear at AA or ALANON meetings (with the addition of a few more interesting historical and artistic references).<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I am not really familiar with Rousseau? But shouldn't this novel have inspired me to find out more?  That is one of the most incredible thing about good writing; a great book sends you onto paths you might not have discovered for yourself.  Instead, this book left me with no interest whatsoever in the life and writings of the man J.J.Todd admired most.<br /><br />Then, after sticking with it for 475 pages, this is the ending you're given?  Maybe someone could explain it to me and I might change my mind in thinking that the author just ran out of energy and motivation to invent a satisfying conclusion to the story of this loser.<br /><br />I liked his book Restless, but I wouldn't recommend New Confessions to anyone.",negative
"I do not understand this book. It is so very dark. It is a counting picture book, presumably for children, yet it talks about funerals, prison line ups, people getting hurt, people leaving and never coming back, lost toys. I had to skip over half of it when reading it to my child. I have never seen a counting book with death and criminals in it. It is completely inappropriate for the age it seems like it is for...<br /><br />The worst part is the concept is okay, basically saying that people feel different things. But the darkness is baffling. Unless you are getting this for a teenager (who isn't going to read a counting book) I do not know who this is aimed for.",negative
"This stories did not bring anything new to the Chronicles and it was actually very boring to read.  It was like reading the same stories over again but without  the excitement of the books have.  It is almost like she didn't even try with this book.  Here publisher, here's a book, print it, people will buy it anyways.  And the ending was meh.  Let with me feeling just, meh.",negative
"I'm not sure what I just read. It's like I fell off a cliff and landed in crazy town. Occupied by a cult stuck in 1985 and worshipping nothing even remotely decipherable. The initial reason for the existence of this bizarre community is never fully explained or how it continues for that matter. Honestly, the mystery of Billy Jean's unstable behavior never mattered to me because I couldn't buy into the entire cult premise to begin with.<br /><br />I was originally interested in this story because of the fact that one of the narrative points of view was the family dog. I came to this with the expectation of an interesting and unique voice. Instead, it was a bitter, weird and off kilter experience. For me, the characters throughout Heartbreaker are all just depressing, twisted, and sad. I'm sure there's an audience who will find a message here that moves them, but I'm just not in that demographic.",negative
"Two stars are for a well-researched look at the diver's life and what an actual dive for treasure would be like.  Two stars for credibility - as, at age 70, I would be surprised if Mrs Lowell had taken up deep sea diving for treasure.  Frankly, I was bored to pieces up to halfway through, and was close to not giving a damn about the story - particularly wading through the synthetically lovey-dovey dialogue and thoughts punctuated by blatantly sexy verging on vulgar exchanges. I tried to find some tender beauty in some of these words and thoughts between the lovers - and I'm no prude, but there wasn't much there.<br />Predictability was my other turn-off.  I could see the outline for this story posted on a white board while the Lowell/Maxwells wrote, and she followed it closely.<br />I realize I am out on the thin ice all by myself, as 24-30 million books sold probably means there are 24-30 million folks out there who think she writes a fantastic book.  Maybe the 60 others are fantastic.  I think this one falls short.",negative

"I bought this as a gag gift for a friend, and expected it to be pretty horrible. I  looked at the first few pages...and ended up reading the whole book! It was actually quite well-written. As you would expect, the title character does indeed make out with half the females in the book, but there was an actual plot, as well as a couple of sub-plots worked in. Sort of a lesbian Nancy Drew.",positive
"I purchased this book when it first came out.  I was initially pleased and made place mats by using one of the patterns. They came out well and I had no problems.  I recently completed a warp to make Serendipity, one of the more attractive patterns featured in the book. I reviewed the directions for threading but counting up the number of ends I would need and comparing the count with the pattern in the book I had a different count. I recounted several times and even tried several ways of adding things up but my end count remained the same. I assume that I misunderstood the sparse directions which were not clear.  It would have taken little effort to include clear instructions. I will not waste the warp, I will use for another project but it won't be from this book.",negative

"In the book “Animal in Suits” by Timur Raad, the book speaks about life working in corporate jobs. As mentioned in the book name, “Animal in Suits”, Animal represents people that are in suits working in corporate jobs. In the beginning we see that the protagonist Jake, talks about the world of working in a corporation with loads of work, his coworkers, and his personal life. The characters in the book are represented as “The Box-On Top” which showcase the social hierarchy that is being presented in the book instead of using the words like manager, directors, human resources, etc. Jake’s personal life was miserable because all Jake thought about was his work instead of giving time to himself. When the book reaches the ending, Jake realizes what his goals were and what he wants to accomplish. In my opinion the book is interesting in the way that Timur Raad has started off with the protagonist describing the work environment and the characters in the book then leading towards the ending of a goal that the protagonist wants to achieve.<br />- Michelle.

"I like that the book goes into decent depth on techniques and whether they work better in home kitchen or in commercial setting; seasoning of the wok and the various types of woks in the market [easy to buy the wrong one for what you had intended it for] and some history behind stir fries.  I cook a lot of stir fries and it is just easy and lock in freshness of the vegetables.  it is not about over cooking, which the recipe does simply as the steps are fast: prep your ingredients.  recipes include vegetables, chicken, beef and rice/noodles.  most ingredients you can easily find in supermarkets these days.  Some recipes are westernized for the americans and the author points those out, which I like as there needs to be a separation  of authentic and 'bastardizing' a dish.  education is important for culture to be recognized in their authentic form.  I like this stir fry book than an earlier one the author wrote.",positive

"I love DK books. We have several and they make even boring subjects interesting and entertaining. This is a heavy book. It's filled with beautiful photographs, charts, and diagrams. It gives a lot of information as well. It's geared toward someone who wants to know some general facts and information about natural wonders, but it's not going to give you the full comprehensive details about all that it covers. It does give you enough facts to appease curious minds and if there's something you want to know more about, then you can do the research on your own. It's not a book that I would sit and read from cover to cover, but it's one that I will pick up and peruse though now and then. It's visually stunning and would make an excellent coffee table book.",positive
"When I first received this book to review, I saw that the author had written a previous account of her early childhood in foster care, ""Somebody's Someone.""  I ordered this book from the library, thinking it would give me insight into the current book, and it does.  If you have time, I urge you to read ""Somebody's Someone"" first, as it will give you background and context.  Frankly, it is better written as well.<br /><br />However, I do not want to take anything away from ""Someone Has Led This Child to Believe.""  Regina continues the account of her life through adolescence and early adulthood, and it is difficult for this middle class white woman to comprehend how she survived with her spirit and mind intact.  I am sure writing these books has been cathartic for her, and I applaud all those who tried to help, and especially those who succeeded.  Most readers will be appalled at the abuse, physical, mental, sexual, psychological, that Regina lived through.  Essentially abandoned by her mother and father, sent from foster home to group home to the homes of parents she did not know. Expected to clean the house and care for younger children when only a child herself--how she survived this is nothing short of a miracle.  And the miracle comes in the form of people who saw something of value in Regina and led her to believe in herself and her future.<br /><br />This book will appeal to those who are interested in children, such as foster parents and teachers, but it is not an easy read.  It is a good and necessary book, however.  Highly recommended.",positive
"I was hooked from the beginning! It's an engaging book that never slowed down. It's told primarily in two perspectives - one is Nina, a grifter and Vanessa, a socialite/Instagram Influencer. There will be a chapter told from one of them and often the next one is retelling the same events but from the other's point of view. It's not quite what I would call a thriller, but it does have some thrilling elements. There are several twists that kept things exciting. I was unfamiliar with the author prior to reading it, but now I want to check out her other works!",positive
"SOME CHOOSE DARKNESS is a professionally written novel, but it’s just not my cup of tea.  It’s kind of a cross between a police procedural and a cosy mystery, in that:  (1) the main investigator (Rory Moore) is an expert doll restorer (!), in addition to being a terrific forensic reconstructionist (an independent contractor?); and (2) the story depends heavily on the characters’ personalities and their inter-relationships with other people.<br /><br /> The plot is intricately pieced together out of chapters told from different characters’ viewpoints (e.g., Rory, a woman with hyperthymesia (superior memory), the perp aka “the Thief”), and from different time periods (1979, 1981-1982, and 2019).  The slow-moving chapters, packed with description, just dribble out the clues that are supposed to keep the reader reading.<br /><br />Sadly, I haven’t the patience to slog through a mystery/thriller novel that is constructed like this one.  Generally I dislike multiple-viewpoint narration--for escape reading, I prefer police procedurals with fairly straightforward investigations.  Also, I really dislike plots where the main investigator (female, of course) gets personally sucked into the crimes being investigated (against women, of course), and ultimately gets nearly killed by the main perp.  These plots always require a lot of coincidences that totally destroy my reader’s willing suspension of disbelief.",negative

"The Knight's Secret written by Jeffery Bardwell sadly isn't for me.  I find that the book really lacks a major plot and found that it sort of just drifts along. For the most part it's just rambling off Sir Corbin and whoever he is talking to. I am kind of missing the point of this story so far, but since I have no intention of picking up future books, reading this one was pretty much a waste of my time.<br /><br />The page of the book is slow and I mean SLOW. There were quite a few times I just glanced over the pages because the part was just dragging out too much.<br /><br />There was no particular character that was really worth mentioning that I felt somewhat connected to and that included Sir Corbin / Kelsa.<br /><br />There were no real twists or turns, no secrets that you are looking forward to be revealed, just nothing that I look forward to in a book sadly. There were a few editorial errors but nothing major.<br /><br />All in all this was just a very bland story that did nothing for me. Maybe the next one is better and is where all the action is but this one was not for me and I got one can not recommend it.",negative

"The author lost one of her premature twin sons shortly after birth and this book is about her loss. Her story and grief process is written in a chaotic style, many times fluttering from one thought to the next with limited cohesiveness. However, this chaotic thought process will probably resonate with those who have experienced the loss of a child, especially a newborn. Some of her story I could relate to even though I never lost a child. The reader will understand what it is like to experience thoughtless comments from those who know nothing of her misery or who want to avoid thinking about it because it causes them pain. I can relate because when my best friend (who also happened to be an ex-boyfriend) committed suicide by hanging himself in his bedroom, I was treated to thoughtless comments by others such as &#34;wow that must have been a high ceiling.&#34; Of course, there are those who react appropriately, but that is less often the case.<br /><br />In summary, some mothers who have lost a newborn or young child will be able to truly feel that someone else has experienced what they are going through. However, not everyone will relate to the chaotic style in which this is written. It is not so much a succinct tale from beginning to end as it is several short stories with jumbled thoughts thrown in-between that really demonstrates the upheaval and utter sadness such a death imposes on the mother.",positive

"They say you can't judge a book by its cover but I've always thought you could to some degree. Publishers would only hire the great cover artists for their books they thought would be immense successes. 2nd string artists got the rest of the work on book they were taking a chance on. The cover of this book looks like it was done in ten or fifteen minutes in Microsoft's Paint. I should have stopped there and declined the book but I made myself finish both of the stories this contained.<br /><br />The book reads like it was written in a language other than English and then translated over. If this is the case then it's one of the better translations that I've come across but the dialog, phrasing and writing is still strange to my English raised ears. Dialog like; &#34;Tell your parents I am coming for a visit. I will see you all after three days.&#34; just don't sound right and they jarred me completely out of the narrative when I came across them which was sadly all too often.<br /><br />The first and longest story is a retelling, modern day take on the Cinderella tale. While I can suspend belief for a lot of things the main plot, actions of the characters and yes, the dialog, were just too much. If you're held captive in an inescapable house but can see people walking by why don't you break a window and scream for help? If you've been told your husband or wife died while you were sick wouldn't one of the first things you'd do on recovery be visiting their grave to pay your respects? So many things should have ended this story before it actually happened. It's just too unbelievable which added to the bad dialog made for a book I could not enjoy.<br /><br />The 2nd story should put parents in a panic to reinforce their don't talk to strangers and never go off on the motorcycle of some strange adult you met ten minutes earlier. Seriously? This story read like a mediocre grammar school writing project. C-, Needs Work.<br /><br />The author alerted me by email that the book was to be free for a short time and asked for a review.",negative

"This cookbook is easy to read and most of the ingredients (except for the eel) are pretty easy to get if you live in an urban area.  Despite the healthy looking dish on the cover, a lot of recipes involve frying in oil.  For those who are extremely health conscious or want to limit their salt intake, you will find fewer recipes.<br /><br />I found several recipes in the rice and noodle section that are more health conscious; but many of the dishes I wouldn't make because of the deep frying involved (those requiring a 1/4 cup or more of oil).  I did make the sweet potato noodle dish which was delicious.  Since the dish included 1/4 cup of sugar, some would not call it totally healthy.  It took me two hours to make but a more accomplished cook could do it in one hour.<br /><br />I feel this cookbook is a nice addition to a cook's library and certainly everyone should be able to find at least three recipes in this cookbook that will be suitable to their diet, tasty, and worth the cost of the book.",positive

"In most of my life, I have owned cats. I currently have 3 senior girls. This book is an easy read. I sat down and was able to read it from start to finish in a couple of hours.  I found it to be informative. There was some new information, but most of it was stuff that I already knew, so it would probably be very helpful to new cat owners. There are  colored pictures (of cats, of course!) at the start of each chapter. Each chapter also has a personal story or author's insight section, too. I do wish there were more pictures and not just because I love cats!  For example, there's a section about cat body language. It would have been helpful to see exactly what the position looks like. Another comment that I have is that the book refers to cat therapy music a couple of times. I would like more information about that as I don't know what cat therapy music is.

"This is the second book I have read in the Roy Grace series, and I honestly wish I has begun at the beginning.  So many of the characters have histories in previous books of the series, and knowing about each one would make reading this one a richer experience.  Still, I enjoyed this book very much and will gladly read more.<br /><br />In the current book, Roy Grace is given the duty of protecting a superstar singer and actress named Gaia in the usual locale, Brighton.  Gaia is in Brighton to shoot a movie in which she plays the mistress of King George IV, and she has been getting death threats.  In one attempt on her life, her assistant was murdered.  In an apparently unrelated event, a murder is committed at a chicken farm, and only the torso of the victim is found.  Are these related?  This is a mystery, so of course they are, though the reader is not let in on the secret for a long time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on a personal level, Roy's fiancee Cleo is pregnant, so he is trying to get his long-missing wife, Sandy, declared legally dead so he can marry Cleo.  Another woman comes to Brighton to look at the home Roy and Sandy shared.  She, too, has a child--is it Sandy's child with Roy?<br /><br />This book has a lot of twists and turns, and some questions are left unanswered.

"This book had the potential to be great.  Instead it falls short of the mark by a wide margin.<br />Although the book provides a sound framework for developing and deploying solutions, it has a major flaw.  Throughout the author raises interesting issues in the form of rhetorical questions, then ... nothing. Quite disapponting.  Had the questions been followed by solutions or recommendations, then the book would have both substance and value. Substance by stepping up and providing viable answers and solutions to problems faced when developing and implementing internet solutions.  Value by saving us from having to discover the answers on our own, wasting resources along the way.<br />The whole point of buying a book such as this is to benefit from lessons learned.  It is frustrating to realize that the book could have been a valuable resource had the author only taken the time to provide answers to the very questions he raised.",negative
"I saw a review of &quot;Sacré Blues&quot; in a Canadian newspaper (I don't remember which one) and decided that, since I was in Québec and frankly quite clueless regarding many aspects of Québec history and culture, I picked up a copy at an Archambault in Sainte-Foy. I had resolved to put it away for the return train trip to Toronto, but I started reading a little bit each night. At some points in the book I was laughing out loud so much my neighbours must have wondered about my sanity.<br />I spent a month in Québec and plan to return often, and &quot;Sacré Blues&quot; helped me to understand some of the issues in modern Québec. I have taken a Québécois civilisation course, but there are many topics in the book that elaborated on things we had touched on in class, such as Québécois winters, language, popular culture, famous people, the strange and fascinating addiction to cholesterol-laden food (poutine! May Wests! Pepsi!), tabloid newspapers, politics, the Floribécois (retired Québécois who migrate in droves to Florida every winter), Céline Dion, and much, much more.<br />Grescoe writes with tongue-in-cheek humour that sometimes amounts to laugh-out-loud guffawing, such as the Québec Language Police...something that I evidence firsthand.

"I'm glad I got this book, but I was a little underwhelmed when it did not live up to my expectations as a ""masterclass."" I was hoping for far more instructional, step by step.  What it is is 100 projects done by 100 accomplished artists with a description of their one piece and basics on their technique.  It is not bad, but it is when compared to other idea and skill building books I got at the same time.  I still gleaned a lot of inspiration, and it was well worth the time, but did not live up to my hopes for a masterclass book.",positive
"THE NOWHERE MAN is the second &#34;Orphan X&#34; novel, and it's a high-octane, page-turning thriller.  However, it's extremely brutal.  The Nowhere Man (aka Orphan X, aka Evan Smoak) unselfishly helps ordinary people out of serious, life-threatening trouble, but in the end he's nothing more than a highly skilled, U.S. Government-trained, freelance assassin.  He has been taught to kill people, and that's what he does, over and over again, throughout the novel.<br /><br />In the novel, a teen-age girl calls the Nowhere Man for help when she is about to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery.  Evan responds and takes out the mastermind of the human trafficking operation.  But when he is cleaning up some loose ends, he is kidnapped, and then imprisoned in a remote, snowed-in chalet.  His captor (Rene) is a genteel but ruthless villain who wants the $27 million held in one of Evan's many concealed bank accounts.  In managing his escape, Evan leaves many, many, many bodies behind.<br /><br />The plot is reasonably interesting, but it's almost entirely driven by well-written, high-action, bloody fight scenes in which Evan dispatches guards and old enemies by working with minimal tools (e.g., a napkin ring, a trash bag), and by coming up with creative plans to gain just the slightest advantage over his captors.  I found this book entertaining--in a horrid fascination sort of way--but one &#34;Orphan X&#34; novel is definitely all that I ever want to read.",positive

"Like so many others, I loved A Gentleman in Moscow and to a little lesser extent Rules of Civility, so I was eager to start The Lincoln Highway.  Towles is a urban dweller, and knows little about life in rural Nebraska, and those characters were so stereotypical, it almost hurt.  Some characters could be edited out with out and damage to the story line (Sally and Pastor John), and if I were his editor, I would have cut at least 100 pages from the book. The disjointed plot line jumped all over hell and back, and really added nothing to the story, just a bit of literary shenanigans.  In the end, I mostly enjoyed the Woolly and Billy characters, really never warmed up to Emmett, and really cared nothing for Duchess, as he seemed to not care about anybody but himself in the entire book. I have no patience for characters like that and was ready to pack it in half way through the book. Every writer produces a dud, and I hope this was Towles one and only.  PS. Figure out how to write dialogue, these - - and run on sentences were so unnecessary.",negative

"As a sci fi fan who cut his teeth on the flood of nuclear armageddon stories that flooded the sci fi world in the 1950s, I was very much looking forward to this book. Having read, watched, and listened to more end of the world tales than I can count, a new take on the apocalypse is always welcome. Sadly, Last Day was a total disappointment for me. One quarter of the way into the book, all I've encountered are damaged characters ranging from the unlikable to the forgettable, each of them as boring as their lives are. Nothing in the narrative drew me into the story or gave me any reason to keep reading. Instead, I was forcing myself to continue for the sake of this review. When I got to the part about a rich guy floating bubbles of mouse pee in a weightless space station because he had so much money he could get away with it, I threw in the towel. Perhaps this book eventually does something interesting with these folks. Personally I don't care enough about any of them to stick around any longer to see. Peace out.",negative

"Judging by toc alone, this would be a wonderful book, comprehensive, indepth, with examples. the author knows what to cover, or the topic of interest.<br /><br />Diving into it, many examples starts with no clue what it is for, what is it suppose to do, and what is expected output. Each example are broken down into pieces, sprinkled with sparse explanations, often doesn't help much. Come on, make some efforts, both Manning and Oreily do far better job on formatting code with pointed comments!!! This inflated the whole book into 700+ pages.<br /><br />On top of that, there are places I feel deserved a much greater discussion (such as concurrency), the book merely scratch the surface, this is true for many other topics as well. All in all, a big disappointment.",negative
"This book will definitely  be going on my “Best Of 2020 “ list! It was beautifully written historical fiction, set in the 1950’s in the Deep South. There was a nostalgic feel, due to the author’s attention to details like television sets in store windows, women dressed up in gloves and hats to visit town, icy-cold Cokes bought at the general store on a summer day.  There was an underlying tension beneath the innocence, however; in several places I found myself holding my breath as I read.<br />I loved this story with its message of the power of true friendship. It also shows how destructive predjudice and hatred can be, when people use the excuse, “That’s the way things have always been” to justify it.<br />A wonderful book for Y.A. readers, with adult guidance. Due to the setting, some words are used and attitudes expressed which would be offensive in today’s society. If history teachers use this book in their classrooms, as I would recommend, it could be a great teaching tool about how things have changed for the better since the Civil Rights Movement.<br />**Thank you, Netgalley, for honoring my request for this book in exchange for an honest review! All opinions are strictly my own.**",positive
"When I was 12, I saw my first bat &#34;sleeping&#34; on a box in the barn at a camp I was staying at. Despite the negative things I heard about bats, I just fell in love from a distance and always wanted to hold one. I have never seen another bat nor have I held one. As with my fascination, this book reminds me of one boy's fascination with bats that has turned into a lifelong career.  The author is addicted to finding them, photographing them, and advocating for them. Each chapter is a different story of his exploits. I honestly don't know how this scientist is alive today as he's gotten himself into many precarious predicaments such as getting his vehicle stuck in quicksand, temporarily losing major lung capacity as a result of an ammonia-filled cave, etc.<br /><br />I enjoyed all his escapades and the lengths he would go to in finding elusive and not-so-elusive bats. Although, this text is a little educational with some tiny bat facts it is really more like the author's trip diary told in an engaging manner.<br /><br />One serious flaw is that there is not even a single picture or centerfold of photos in the entire book. He talks so much about the extreme difficulty of photographing some bats for National Geographic and how beautiful they are that I wanted to see them. The only photo is the un-captioned cover picture but I have no idea what kind of bat it is.<br /><br />Most pre-release books will have blank pages where photos are going to be printed. Therefore, I suspect no photos will be included in the final edition because no such pages exist in my pre-release copy. I think that is a shame because I wanted to view at least one picture of each bat he went searching for and found. This is my only disappointment with this otherwise enjoyable book.",positive

"There was once a MAD TV skit about a lady going to a psychiatrist for help with her phobias. She was deathly afraid of being trapped in a small box. Her psychiatrist's response was, ""Stop it!"" It was a funny sketch. This book reminded me of a long version of that sketch, and not as funny. Perhaps I just didn't get it. I couldn't ever tell if the author was trying to be humorous or if it was an actual self help book where the advice was simply, ""Stop it!"" Maybe it was supposed to be both? I'm not a fan of overly used ""curse"" words. It is obnoxious to me. Perhaps that was my turn off. Or maybe I just didn't like the author's voice in the book. This book just fell very short for me, though I know there will be plenty of people who love and adore it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cover is awesome.",negative

I had to read this in seventh grade. The book didn't grip my attention at all. Everything was predictable. About half way through I no longer cared who stole Kathy young.

"I expected this book to be a simple explanation of morality, politics and religion. However, it is an intense study of our morality, where it comes from, how it develops, and how politics and religion are tied to it.<br /><br />Jonathan Haidt performs an in-depth explanation of why ""politics and religion are both expressions of our underlying moral psychology."" He tries to prove that our morality is innate in our genes but can be molded throughout life. He quotes the neuroscientist Gary Marcus as saying ""Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises....'Built-in' does not mean unmalleable; it means 'organized in advance of experience.""<br /><br />On page 274 in the book, he finally gives a definition of what morality is. However, it is a functional definition defined by what morality does and not by what we consider moral. He explains how liberals and conservatives think. How groups allow you to establish certain cohesiveness without kinship and how ""Gods and religions, in sum, are group-level adaptations for producing cohesiveness and trust."" He demonstrates how morality varies by ethnicity and even though we might consider something immoral; it is in fact very moral to that group.<br /><br />The author is an exceptional writer and is able to explain complex hypotheses using analogies that even I, who has zero interest in philosophy, could understand and actually enjoy reading. This book reminds me of the type of books that Malcolm Gladwell writes such as Blink, The Tipping Point, and Outliers except that it's much more intense, requires extreme focus, takes longer to read, and left me wondering what in the world did I just learn in these 323 pages.<br /><br />The author provides so much supporting theory and various study results that it was hard for me to remember anything, yet it was all so sensible. This is not a book that can be summed up in one sentence. It's very well written and even harder for me to explain yet it is very intriguing and leaves me wishing that I had an additional two weeks' time to re-read it.",positive

"Premise:&#34;There is an eternal truth most of the world has come to accept: Firstlife is merely a dress rehearsal, and real life begins after death.

She's earned her rep as the craziest of crazies, but that doesn't stop the torture. Ten can leave, but only if she allows her parents to choose where she'll live—after she dies. There is an eternal truth most of the world has come to accept: Firstlife is merely a dress rehearsal, and real life begins after death.  In the Everlife, two realms are in power: Troika and Myriad, longtime enemies and deadly rivals. Both will do anything to recruit Ten, including sending their top Laborers to lure her to their side.

Can she stay alive long enough to make a decision?<br /><br />So book 2 'Lifeblood' opens with Tenley in the afterlife - our teen read the glossary of terms, told me both places in the Everlife stink and didn't want to read it.

"All in all, this coloring book is okay. I wouldn't purchase another by this publisher again due to how thin the paper is and the blank border around the doodle images. There are much better books for close to the same price. The book has 17 pictures plus two &#34;bonus&#34; pictures from other editions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Interesting doodle pictures - I attached some examples<br />- Fun patterns that will be nice to color<br />- Pictures are single sided to help with bleed through<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Paper is crazy thin! Even though the pictures are single sided, using my markers it bled through to the next image (see attached). You definitely have to remove the page from the book if you are using markers.<br />- Another con, the pages aren't perforated - so removing them from the book cleanly will require some scissors, luck, or a xacto knife.  Not a big deal, but quite annoying.<br />- The pictures don't take up the whole page, there is a lot of border around even the &#34;full page&#34; images. I prefer the pages to reach all the way to the end.  It will be hard to get clean borders on the square images.",negative

"I was so dismayed by this book that, instead of my usual habit of donating it to the library, I donated it in shredded form to the recycle bin.  The author puts forth an opinion that disease ought not to be cured by any medical or naturopathic means but should be suffered through to somehow cleanse the defective organism.

"Firstly a huge thank you to NetGalley and Graydon House Books for allowing me a copy of this book.<br /><br />After reading “The Witch of Willow Hall,” I knew that Hester Fox would become a staple author on my bookshelves, and “The Widow of Pale Harbor” has cemented that. For me, Hester Fox’s writing is up there with some of the best-loved scream queens of gothic literature such as Mary Shelley, A. M. Barnard and the Brontë sisters.<br /><br />A castle by the sea, ravens, gothic romance, and dark secrets all wrapped up in the scenery of an eerie New England town…oh, be still my beating heart! This is the stuff that all novels should be made of.<br />The book opens with an injured raven at the foot of Castle Carver, the home of one of the book’s main characters, Sophronia Carver. This is the fourth bird to turn up dead (or in this one’s case near dead) at the steps of her home, and Sophronia is beginning to suspect that there may be a dark reason behind this strange coincidence. As a storm begins to roll in over the Atlantic, she retreats back into the large house to watch it from the upper window. But this particular storm is different; she could feel it reverberating in her bones. Perhaps the raven had been a harbinger of things to come, an omen…<br /><br />The book expertly flits between two points of view. That of Sophronia Carver and a second character that we are introduced to in chapter two, Gabriel Stone. The duel viewpoints add depth to the story, but at no point do they complicate it or stop its flow. This is an incredibly easy read that you will not want to put down due to the suspense from beginning to end. So cozy up under the covers with a cup of tea and enjoy this fantastic fall read, just in time for the spooky season!",positive

"I have been an avid fan for many years of Ninjalicious's E-zine Infiltration ([...]), a website devoted to exploring the bowels of those places you're not supposed to go: city hospitals, hotels, subway tunnels, abandoned factories, the works. Sadly, Ninjalicious passed away in August 2005 from a terminal illness, but his love of exploration (and a good yarn!) lives on in Access All Areas.<br /><br />Urban exploration is not for everyone: it is generally illegal, dirty, claustrophobic, and can be downright dangerous, if not fatal (exploring subway tunnels when the trains are in use, risk of electrocution from stepping on the third electrified rail in subway tunnels, asbestos and other toxic chemicals in abandoned factories, drowning if drains flash flood, etc.). For me, I enjoyed reading Ninj's adventures exploring working subway tunnels, abandoned breweries, barging in on hotel swimming pools pretending to be a guest, and other hands-off areas of Toronto.<br /><br />Ninjalicous's writing style and down-to-earth pointers about Urban Exploration (he can most definitely be considered one of the sport's founders), along with the ever-present naughty thrill of ""will you be caught?"" makes it an exciting hobby (please note, I'm an armchair Urban Explorer -- I've never tried exploring Toronto's subways, hospitals, abandoned breweries, or hotels in person, I'm just a fan of Ninjalicious and the *idea* of Urban Exploration.)

"If I knew then what I know now about the book, I wouldn't have gotten it. Boring, slow, one-dimensional characters created a story where you kept reading in anticipation for something to happen until the last page...when nothing happened. Keep in mind that this book was based off of a true story so the author probably tried to keep to the true (and obviously rather monotonous) facts as much as possible.

"As I began reading this and remembering my childhood fascination with the Lindbergh kidnapping, I was worried this fictionalized version of this period in the Lindbergh's lives, told through the eyes of their Scottish nanny, Betty Gow, would not keep my attention.  Wowzers!  I was wrong.  In such an intimate way that a biography could not capture, Fredericks pulls us into the Lindbergh household, the key employees who were questioned and the impact on their lives and the lives of their ""outside"" friends.  There has always been speculation that the kidnapper had an inside accomplice and Fredericks examines this and provides us with her fictional answer about a real person.  She does not mess with the historical facts, but bring them alive in a comprehensive, compelling and entertaining way.  Very glad I read The Lindbergh Nanny!",positive

"Well researched, well-written account of the rise, fall, and ultimate resurrection of the career of the late, great Levon Helm.  Of the books I've read that zero in on the history of The Band (Barney Hoskyns' Across The Great Divide, Levon's This Wheel's On Fire, Robbie's Testimony), this one outclasses them all.  Even-handed, with no axes to grind, Sandra B. Tooze sets about setting the record straight and does just about the best job of it that I can imagine being done (with 3/5ths of the Band being gone).  The one thing missing is a thorough discography, although Ms. Tooze does indeed offer commentary on each major release throughout the body of the book.  Still, a stand alone, easily accessible discography would've been a welcome addition.  Highly recommended.",positive

"This is a good size board book, harder for little hands to hold but recommended for 3 year olds or so. I was actually surprised that is was as large as it is.

"Hi, not worth the money as it's short on information. I was fooled by the glowing reviews. Google TC-22.9 the latest US military training circular. The download is free.

"This book reads pretty quickly. It's basically a bunch of memories told from the perspective of 3rd grader, Nenny. Some of the memories are connected, but others seem more random. The memories are short and separate like chapters.  In the beginning, there are some weird &#34;Fears&#34; dispersed in between a few of the chapters. At first I thought the fears were real and part of the story line, but quickly figured out that they were just a result of an over imaginative 9 year old. The book is set in the 80's, but most of the 80's story line is related to the current events. I was hoping for more 80's pop culture. Overall, it was enjoyable and entertaining.",positive
"I really enjoyed this book and the only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I was really peeved that from the start (and this isn’t a spoiler as it says it pretty much right away) you are told that one of the main characters is going to die. And it’s not just a vague hint that it could be any one of them. No, the character in question is named outright. So I then spent the rest of the book waiting for the inevitable to happen which ruined it for me as if I hadn’t known exactly who was going to die it would have been a real plot twist and one that would have sky rocketed this book to way more than five stars.<br /><br />Anyway that little niggle aside the book itself was a cracking read and I loved it. The writing flowed and the characters were so engaging that I found myself flying though it and having a hard time putting it down. The ending wrapped up incredibly well and bought the whole story to a close whilst still leaving the reader wanting more. Plus there was a great reveal at the end which I won’t spoil. I’ll be ordering copies of D.O.G.S and F.O.X.E.S as soon as I’m done with this review as I really want to read more by M.A Bennett as I enjoyed her writing immensely.<br /><br />Overall S.T.A.G.S was a thrilling read and one that I will be recommending highly!",positive

"I am angry. Angry that all these 5 star reviews couldn't possibly be about this book. I read the reviews and thought this would be a real page turner. The characters are so one dimensional that a reader couldn't possibly care about them one way or another. The title is misleading. It should have been 'Aubrey & the strangler'. The 'lineman' in this story is Gil and except for a brief excerpt from Glen Campbell's 'Wichita Lineman', you have no idea what Gil really does in his job. Not any insight into this lineman's life unless it is with Aubrey. It's all about Aubrey. As for the characters. they have no emotion, realism and depth. I have never been negative when it comes to writers, because I know how hard it is to be published (well, it used to be hard).<br />When reading a book, the reader should be taken inside of it, feeling what the characters feel. I could not have cared less about these characters. As for being a page turner, they turned whenever I dropped the book as I dozed off while waiting for the emotion, the thrill, the anything. The title totally deceived me and that angers me that I paid for this based on reviews.",negative
"I really, really wanted to like this book. It just went on and on and on with very little plot progression or<br />connection to the narrator. At one point I thought it may be best if the whole ship just went down. The<br />impression is that the book should have been half as long. The writing is pretty good...it just drags along.",negative

I give Mr. Trump all the more credit for letting your snide remark slide. You betray the whole theme of your books by doing this. I've come to expect this from certain media but not you.

"Christopher Grey's Leonardo's Shadow is the story of Giacomo, the servant of genius Leonardo da Vinci. However, this life is not as glamorous as it might seem; Leonardo is desperately poor, being two years behind on his largest commission, the Sistine Chapel, and the Duke of Milan refuses to pay until the work is complete. This leaves Giacomo to plead with merchants to extend their non-existent credit for food (Leonardo is a strict vegetarian) and fuel.<br /><br />At first glance, the narrative's device of amnesia is a little too overused and convenient; Giacomo wakes from a near-fatal fall to find that he remembers nothing, and as the story moves along, tantalizing clues about his past are revealed (but all is not as it seems). He desperately wants to be a great artist, but Leonardo rarely acknowledges his existence other than to yell at him, let alone give him the drawing lessons he craves, so Giacomo teaches himself by looking at Leonardo's sketches in secret.<br /><br />He becomes wrapped up in a series of mysterious events including a break-in and dueling with the Duke's spies, even as he faces his greatest challenge: how to get Leonardo to finish the Sistine Chapel? The book's characters and settings are lushly imagined, full of the (sometimes squalid) sights, sounds, and smells of Renaissance Milan. The historical setting immerses Giacomo's story without overpowering it, and the in-depth discussions of Renaissance painting techniques and alchemy were fascinating. The author also confronts the historical assertion that Leonardo was gay (although in this novel, he's asexual).<br /><br />This was a riveting read that will be sure to delight fans of historical fiction and art lovers alike. There is a wealth of knowledge about Leonardo's inventions, paintings, and daily life in Renaissance Italy combined with a gripping story and vivid characters.",positive
"Well, I have never particularly cared for Dr. Colbert when I've seen him on tv.<br />He just rubbed me the wrong way - he didn't do anything personal - just one of those things.<br />But, I saw him on a show where he gave his personal testimony. It made me change my opinion of him.<br /><br />The book title was also annoying to me - I don't like anything to do with a certain number of pillars<br />of anything right now, given the mood of our country. But he gives his explanations for the title.<br />All in all, I didn't see a lot that I would want to try in this book. That's just me.<br />I'll try to add more details later when I can have the book in front of me.<br />I won't say it is useless - just not for me.",negative
"This novel is certainly light reading and full of cliche phrases that made me laugh. I listened to it on Audible. It was actually fun to listen to when I was ill recently; it was a very good stress-reducer. I would hardly call it good writing. The characters are rather flat, corny, and silly. This is a book for teenagers, or possibly, young adults with limited experience of history or good writing. Obviously, Sarah Woodbury borrowed some ideas from the Outlander series, but she does not write nearly as well as Diana Gabaldon.<br /><br />Okay, I changed this from a one star to two stars, since it is rather fun.

"Fourteen-year-old Belle longs for summer; it's when she's free to leave Detroit and return to her family's cottage on Lake Huron. Every summer, she and her siblings participate in the timeless rituals of childhood summers: swimming, fishing, reading, and playing cards in the comfortable cottage they share with their grandparents, sipping lemonade and watching sunsets from the porch. However, the summer of 1942 is different: Belle's cousin Carrie is sent to stay with them. Despite several mentions of pertinent military developments, the story didn't feel dated as WWII (unlike other period novels such as [[ASIN:0345487540 Dream When You're Feeling Blue: A Novel]], the 1940s takes a backseat here).<br /><br />Carrie's arrival upsets the delicate family balance. Raised in France and used to getting her own way, Carrie appears spoiled and obsessed with fashion and society. She looks down on Belle's grandmother's cooking and is horrified to discover that there isn't even a movie theater nearby (Belle's is the only cottage on the island). Carrie rebels against the rules that the rest of the family had followed without questioning, until a tragedy forces her to reevaluate.<br /><br />As with other books by Gloria Whelan ([[ASIN:1882376447 The Pathless Woods: Ernest Hemingway's Sixteenth Summer in Northern Michigan (Ernest Hemingway's Great Lakes Connection)]], [[ASIN:0064406199 Once on This Island (Ramos, Eugenio (Illustrator)]]), Northern Michigan plays a starring role. There are detailed descriptions of wildlife, particularly birds, and of wildflowers, of channel currents and nautical knowledge. You can practically feel the scorching August sand beneath your toes and hear the echoes of thunder as storms roll over the island. Summer of the War is a delightful read that captures the lazy days of summer despite a changing world.",positive

It was interesting to discover how many ailments that are not commonly associated with digestion actually were alleviated or reduced by change in diet and supplementation.<br /><br />I recommend the author consider making the text flow better on a re-write of this text.  To me the book was very reference-like.  I admit it did state in the beginning that the book was not written to be read from front to back.  Nevertheless, I expect books to read this way unless it's specifically labeled as a reference text.",positive

Arrived in great time and packaged well. Great patterns in the book.,positive
The book is horribly put together. The binding is so tight you have to pry the book apart to see what the rest of the paragraph says. So to sit back and read this book you have to have some strong forearm strength. And if you try to pry open the book too much the pages will fall out. Brand new book and chapter 3 has already fallen out within 3 months of casual use.<br />I agree with the other 1 star review that my professor just uses it for equations and there are only a few you need. My professor then just explains it not from the book at all.<br />The author can be humorous but definitely errors and typos.<br />I would recommend the publisher to use thinner paper so that you don't have to pry the book apart just to finish the paragraph.,negative

"I went into this thinking I would like it, especially with the special introduction from the author that gave it such a personal twist and connection.  However, the story lost me pretty early on and I didn't finish it.  I hate to say that I gave up on it, but I realized that the approach wasn't what I expected and I think it needs a different audience.  If you like more fantasy elements mixed with current issues, this might be more up your alley than it was for me.  I wish I liked it more, but I had to move on.",negative
"I really enjoyed this book. Wasn't expecting it to be quite as riveting as it turned out. I found myself really getting rapped up with the characters and the situations they found themselves and the hardships they endured. Amazingly, the author transports the reader into another world. I come from the east coast, yet I easily could feel night after night when reading this that I was truly in Nebraska with the Jones' and their family. I will also say that the edition I had came with a sample audio CD as well, and I will be ordering the full version. I often travel on business and make it a habit of listening to audio books while on the road for several hours of the time. I listened to the sample and the narrator was wonderful. I can't wait to hear the full version on audio. This would make a wonderful book for a child to give their mother, teacher or other female relative as a present for the holidays!",positive
"I eagerly awaited the release of this book. I placed it on my calendar. I pre-ordered a copy. I was excited! And I was not let down too terribly.<br /><br />After crossing the Line, Rachel finds herself in a world so unlike the one she has grown up in. A place she has read about with fascination, but never thought she'd see. Away from the only family she knows, she has to trust those she has just met.<br /><br />I wish I could give it 5 stars, but it fell a little flat in a few places. Rachel's character, while seeming mostly the same, looses a bit of her muchness in this book. It isn't that she is different, she just isn't quite as much as she was in [[ASIN:B005FOGWLM The Line]]. Also, I'm still not sure what to make of Peter and The Maps. That bit of the story just gets a little lost. And I feel like we lost a lot of the incident with Indigo in Benton to editing. It just didn't feel as climatic as it should have. The end, while exciting, felt a bit flat.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting the third book. It is a series that is worth continuing, despite the small issues.<br /><br />Parental blurb, since this is a young adult book: Not much cursing or mention of sex. There is some fighting and killing, though not extremely graphic in nature. The main character kisses and that is about it at this point. Very positive view of family.",positive

"As a knitting history buff, I like this book a lot.  It's a pattern collection with a twist:  the patterns are inspired by knitting fashion eras.  Fashionable handknits and knitting fashion trends in each era (the roaring twenties, the glamorous thirties, the thrifty forties, the fabulous fifties, the swinging sixties, the groovy seventies, and the dramatic eighties) are described at the beginning of each era's chapter, and then illustrated with photos taken from the era's knitting pattern books.<br /><br />What I particularly like, is the way that each garment pattern captures the flavor of its era.  For example, there is (1) a bed jacket from the forties, converted to a modern bolero (the cover photo), (2) a cloche hat from the twenties, complete with artificial flowers, (3) a beaded angora cardigan from the fifties, (4) an Aran cardigan from the sixties, (5)  a poncho from the seventies, and (6) a batwing sweater knit in glittery yarn from the eighties.  In addition, there are patterns for twinsets, headbands, a lacy accent collar, a Pucci bag, flapper and mini dresses, a Fair Isle vest, oversized pullovers, socks, and leg warmers.<br /><br />The original patterns inspired by each era are updated in sizing and fit to accommodate current knitting fashion tastes.  Yarns used to knit the garments are all modern yarns that are  currently available (or an equivalent yarn is available).<br /><br />Probably I'll never knit any of these patterns, but the garments are attractive.  Certainly the book is not a serious reference for knitting historians, but I enjoyed reading the historical text and looking at the photos.  Overall, I rate this book at 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars (""I like it"").",positive

"SUCCULENTS: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO CHOOSING, DESIGNING, AND GROWING 200 EASY CARE PLANTS is a typical Sunset book, with the first 125 pages (of 288) devoted to &#34;Inspirations&#34;--photographs of mature succulent gardens located in the U.S. West.  The next 56 pages show &#34;Easy Projects&#34;--photographs and directions for using succulents in Christmas ornaments, table dressings, hair ornaments, bird houses, patio containers, and more.<br /><br />The next 64 pages are a catalog of &#34;My Favorite Plants&#34;--photographs of 203 easy-care succulents with a single-paragraph description of the plant and its growth behavior.  The final 22 pages contain &#34;Planting and Care&#34; information, and a good index (including both Latin and common names of the plants).

Still, it's probably a more complete guide for selection and growing of succulents than either my previous favorite references, [[ASIN:1604693932 Succulents Simplified]], or [[ASIN:0789416573 The Complete Book of Cacti & Succulents]].<br /><br />It's a useful book for gardeners like myself who are responding to the recent California drought (and the possibility of future droughts) by replacing traditional grass, ground cover, and ornamental plants with water-saving succulent gardens.",positive

"I can't believe there was a time when I used to be at the bookstore when it opened on the day a John Grisham book was released.  Those days are LONG gone.  I don't know why, but I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, that was wishful thinking on my part.  This was so sloppy and disappointing, you'd never know Grisham has sold tens of millions of books. I'm not impressed with the stories (this reads more like short stories than just one story) at all. The characters pretty much bore me. But the worst thing of all is Grisham's attitude towards certain groups of people. He does nothing but trash police, FBI, SWAT, etc in this book.  It would be one thing if he was trashing the fictional police/SWAT/FBI in his book but I do believe he is trashing ALL of those groups, even real life police/SWAT/FBI.  I was VERY disappointed  with the way he trashed 2 overweight female characters (the judge, Carla from domestic relations) too.  (For the record, I am NOT overweight and am not taking his trashing of the obese characters personally.)<br /><br />I wish that i had read reviews before my purchase. My fault. I would have waited for this to hit paperback or maybe even skipped it entirely.  Such a disappointing book. Grisham has 'jumped the shark'.",negative

I found the pace went very past in the first couple of chapters in trying to absorb all the characters, it was a little confusing. In total there were three possible suspects and boy, the author really kept you guessing, feeding you with tidbits and when you thought who it was, you are back at square one.  Ooh, by the way, this is an English author so expect a lot of British jargon which you will love.  All set in the cosmopolitan city of Brighton .. Where a fetishness so gross, you wonder if the bugger was ever going to be caught.  All I can say is, yes and no!

"I don't know about the claim that the book is darkly comedic, except only in a very dark way, but I can see how it could be adapted for the screen in such a way, especially since the story does lend itself to movie adaption. The story, a crime thriller, goes on a path which incorporates much music, a tracing of the blues, which fits the story as itself is kind of a metaphor for a blues song. That said, I really like the book. It combines suspense and an interesting assortment of characters, though I would prefer it not have the gory bits of violence it contains, even though I do see how it does fit the story.",positive

"It wasn't that I thought that this was the absolute worse book that I have ever written, but I think it was lacking something. It could have been that there was great build-up to a showdown, that was really anticlimatic at best.<br /><br />Vicki, is a waitress (or server I think they prefer to be called) at a local diner, and notices a mysterious stranger who visits regularly, but doesn't eat, or come out during the day (hint). Meanwhile, there is a serial killer out there hunting red heads (Vicki is one)and leaving them drained of blood. Who could the killer be, the handsome stranger that she has seen leave the diner with two of the victims.<br /><br />Antonio, the mysterious yet handsome stranger, decides that he will warn all red heads of the perils of inviting a stranger into their homes. And yet they still are dying at alarming rates. His only annoying trait to me what his constance references to Vicki as either ""Sweeting"", ""Sweet"" or ""Sweetness"". I kept thinking, to be so ruggedly suave and old, shouldn't he say things that were more modern and endearing?<br /><br />The book has the normal stuff found in vampire books, a ghost, a vampire hunter, some humans who know of the vampires existence and a really, really bad guy. What little that the story had that was different, was so buried in such stupidness that you really didn't appreciate it. Do I regret reading it? Not really, I was able to read it in two days and although I probably won't remember this novel this time next year I was slightly entertained.",negative

"The Circus Train overall is a good story and the writing is engaging, but it feels like there was an effort to fit too much into the novel, making it disjointed and uneven.  The novel opens in  Europe  just around the start of WWII.  I cannot share too much about what I'm talking about because of spoilers.  Lena, a nine year old girl who uses a wheelchair as a result of contracting polio as an infant, was born in Greece.  Ten months of the year, she travels with her father, Theo, with the ""World of Wonders.""  Theo is a fabulous illusionist with this circus, so talented that he could write his own ticket to work for Horace the owner. . In helping out a boy in trouble, Alexandre, Lena makes a friend.  Horace reluctantly agrees to let him stay and apprentice to Theo.  Alexander has recently been orphaned and his passport shows he is Jewish, a serious problem when the circus is traveling in Germany.  Ultimately, the book suggests that various characters have backstories they are keeping as deep secrets, Lena begins to work toward walking with the help of the circus doctor and encouragement of Theo and Alexandre, the world is upside-down in chaos and the war ultimately affects the circus's finances and bad things happen to some of the characters and the backstories get exposed and resolved -- or not-- and then it is the early 1950s and more stuff happens and then it is over.  Lena is super smart. Alexandre is very clever.  Horace is a business man with mixed morals.  The Nazis are bad.  Theo remains unrivaled as an illusionist, except, arguably for Alexandre.  I don't mind and often enjoy improbable stories that have almost an air of whimsy or gotcha.  But Parikh is telling us to buy into too much in the various twists and turns of the book and I found that irritating at times.  It is a strong 3.5 stars for me, rounded up to 4 because many segments of the book, standing alone are exceptional.  Note:  many people love this book.",positive

"The author wastes no time in instantly (and a little too conveniently) plunging readers into the heart of the conflict, and characters are similarly divided onto opposing sides. The descriptions of the majority of the principal players is just plain weird; pretty much everyone is exceptionally good-looking, athletic, smart, and talented. The descriptions would be more appropriate in cheesy romance novels coming from a lovestruck adolescent girl instead of one’s 50 year old, same gender archeology professor. And virtually all of them are sappy superlative in the same way. As we are being introduced to these paragons of virtue or ultra-villains, we are simultaneously being rushed straight into the heart of the conflict. Relationships between characters begin and mature at warp speed and are—of course—extra strong and everlasting. It’s just plain hokey, unless the target audience is that outcast group of middle school losers with bad skin who engage in elaborate role playing games and fantasize about having superpowers that will 1) save the world and 2) allow them to exact revenge from the popular kids. Honestly, I would have had a very hard time believing that this book was written by an adult, except that the author manages to include a vast amount of world history—as crucial to understanding the nature of the main conflict, of course. Don’t expect to get confused by a bunch of meandering subplots or complex twists or quirks or character! We are on a singleminded quest. And then it is just as quickly done and just as predictably over. I wish I could say it was satisfying. As an adult reader who very frequently reads Young Adult fantasy/science fiction novels, I am left scratching my head. This book doesn’t really have the necessary attributes to appeal to fans of that genre, nor does it possess the sophistication and complexity to appeal to adult fantasy/sci fi fans. In any case, I won’t be impatiently waiting for the next novel, nor would I encourage others to waste their time with this one. There’s just way too many better plotted and more engaging novels in this genre out there. Skip it!",negative
"I did not really care for this book and I wouldn't read it with my child. I felt that it had some poor lessons in it. It stars out about talking about how most teachers are strange... when you are working hard to get your kids to respect teachers, I don't think that's a great way to teach. So the teacher, who seems to be a witch, then teaches the kids with her magic, but I find many of the lessons to be poor. Like how she uses magic to cheat and get them to win a game. It shows other teachers in a bad light trying to catch her doing something bad and she retaliates against them. It is extremely short with large print and pictures so even if you like it, it is way shorter than the chapter books. I'll be looking for a different series.",negative

"When I first ordered this book, I was a little uncertain if it was of the literary genre I am accustomed to reading. Needless to say, and to my delight, it was a real eye-opener. Even if, like myself, you are not into the ""Big Hunt"", American Buffalo is author Steven Rhineland's earthy, plain-spoken look at America's ""lost icon."" It's a story filled with facts, legends, lore, science and history. A really wonderful read and makes an enlightened gift to give to your self or someone you love.",positive
"How refreshing to read a rock musician's autobiography that is exactly that -- his life story, his words, not 'as told to' or ghost-written.  Even more refreshing is the fact that Chris Hillman story teller is just like Chris Hillman singer / songwriter/ player -- low-key and straight ahead, no flash or fake fireworks.  I've been a fan since 1965 when I won a copy of The Byrds' Mr. Tambourine Man LP from NYC's WMCA Good Guys.  I have the complete Hillman discography in my collection (with a few compilation exceptions) and I've found something of value in all of them, even though there've been some missteps along the way.  Time Between recounts his family and musical life with warts and all honesty, and, perhaps even more importantly, he shares his spiritual journey and his road to contentment with the reader as well.  It's a fine ride, a journey worth taking, for sure, like a long talk with an old friend.  I'd have liked an index included for quick reference purposes, but that's a minor quibble.  Highly recommended.",positive

"I was really into it. I let go of the fact that there aren't descriptions of what people look like and felt maybe the author did that on purpose to let us imagine who we wanted. I let go of the fact that the descriptions of surroundings were not consistent and some situations were not quite realistic. However, I can't let go that it seemed when the BIGGEST moment in this story happened the author just rushed right through it all.  Never answering many questions about characters that they kept bringing up in the book then blazed right through a huuuge moment to just get to the end. It felt the author was tired of writing the story and just wanted to skip today a big fantasy ending that wasn't very impactful when they didn't really fill out the important parts. Disappointed as this idea really could have been done well and thorough even if it took another 300 pages to do so it would have been more filling and rewarding.",negative
"I'm all about a good sci-fi story and time travel can bring a fun riddle aspect to the story. However, I am disappointed with this book in several ways. I've never heard of the author before, so I had no preconceived notions of what to expect.<br /><br />The premise here is very interesting, but make no mistake, comparisons to Dr Who stop after the words &#34;time travel&#34;. The characters here are incredibly immature and wrapped up in a seemingly never ending, teenage emotional drama. It really drags down the pace of the book and distracts from the plot.<br /><br />The plotline is scattershot and just drifting along. The only motivation for many of the character actions are greed. The Eliot character is very heavy handed with foreshadowing that just left me irritated. It's a shame because this is a book that could be fun with serious editing. It just didn't work for me.",negative

"I generally like the Kenyon books, they are USUALLY entertaining, easy to read and good. But this one just wasn't. I was really disappointed! I started the book several months ago, and put it down. That is so unlike me, and if you check out the reviews that I have made recently, you will see that I read SEVERAL books (LA Banks, Feehan, Nora Roberts, Charlie Huston, JD Robb, and countless others) in the time that I put it away, but I was determined to finish it, and finish it I finally did. The book really had everything that should have worked for a paranormal romance novel, a sexy dream God(Arik), a lonely but beautiful, intelligent PHD, heroine (Megeara ""Geary"" Kafieri), several other demigods/GODS who caused trouble (Hades, Kat, and countless others) and a story that many people would find interesting (the search for Atlantis), but what the story lacked was good character development and a plot. There were chunks of story that were boring and frankly stupid....we all knew what the ending would be, it just took too long to get there. There were also several hints that the main character or her teammates were not what they seem, but they never really explain what her dreams or ability to influence dreams really meant. Maybe this would have been better as a SHORT story, I am not sure. I know that I just find it difficult to get excited about reading another Kenyon novel. I have already purchased Dark Side of the Moon, and hope that I have not wasted my money. So although I am a Kenyon fan, I would not suggest reading this one! Trust me, all of the reviewers aren't wrong. And while I love to support, some things you have to well frankly believe others.",negative

"OMG what a ride!! This book is filled with suspense, love, hate, corruption and most of all...determination. Sally is married to a very abusive man. When she is approached by her best friend Jude about her helping to bring down the syndicate, she hesitates,but after her husband beats her yet again,she agrees to help. Hubby Billy works for the mob as a muscle..eliminating who ever the boss tells him to so Sally needs to be very careful. Her relationship with a man from her past Alex complicates things as well. This is not only an amazing story..but it is also a story of the abuse that women face everyday in their life. It is a story of determination and trying to stay alive ..no matter what. It is amazing how Sally seems so meek and timid in the beginning,but after she has a son she does a complete turn around to protect her son, Zander and keep them both alive.

Apparently, no one at the magazine bothered to read the book prior to recommending it. It was a great page turner, grabbing you from the beginning -- that is, until about Chapter 7. That is where it turned bad. I really disliked reading what the last half of this book contains.

"I liked author Julia Heaberlin’s previous novel, [[ASIN:0804178011 Black-Eyed Susans]], a lot, but didn’t care at all for PAPER GHOSTS: A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE. The basic premise—a young woman locates her sister’s probable killer, who is suffering from dementia, and obtains his release from a care home for a 10-day, 2-person auto trip across Texas, so she can extract his confession—is simply too bizarre and unbelievable.<br /><br />This is a first-person narrative, and if you don’t buy into the premise, then the strange young woman isn’t likeable enough to sustain interest in her curious machinations. She has designed little tests, involving photographs and objects (e.g., a scarf similar to a murder victim’s), that she hopes will reawaken the still-dangerous serial killer’s lost memories.  Their effectiveness is limited by the killer’s unexpected lucidity.  Has he been feigning his dementia?<br /><br />The parts of the narrative that describe the young woman’s sister, the sisters’ relationship, and the Branch Davidian debacle at Waco are poignant and well-done.  However, this doesn’t make up for the incredible plot premise, and the equally incredible, unsatisfying, surprise ending.",negative

It was scary, but also humorous.<br />Language was remarkably clean for the genre. Gore was there, but not overly gory. It was scary, but not scarring. The perfect amount to hook you and not let you put the book down until you finished, but you’ll still be able to sleep this week.",positive

"Having sampled Shepherd's THE SOLITARY HOUSE and found it a fairly interesting mystery despite not having read the Dickens' novel that was its inspiration (BLEAK HOUSE), I thought I would give this newest effort a try. I'm sorry to say I found it a less-than-stellar knockoff of DRACULA. Victorian investigator Charles Maddox visits Baron Von Reisenberg in Austria to see if a donation promised to Oxford University by the Baron is legitimate. Instead he finds Von Reisenberg's name strikes terror in those whose homes surround his castle and the homestead itself is a place of horror. He escapes only by being confined to a hospital with a fever. But once back in London, he discovers the Baron has arrived there as well.<br /><br />Shepherd's description, especially in the first third of the book where Maddox is in Austria, is haunting and atmospheric. You feel the penetrating cold, witness extraordinary and terrifying sights, shudder at the atmosphere of evil which permeates the surroundings. The problem is that the story itself doesn't live up to the descriptive language, and frankly Maddox isn't a very appealing protagonist. I was also bothered by the fact that this is the second novel of Shepherd's that I've read that features terrifyingly brutal things happening to women; some of the narrative is extremely hard to endure. Since I haven't sampled her first novel or the one that preceded THE PIERCED HEART, I'm not sure if this is a regular feature of her mysteries, but for myself twice is enough. I won't be ordering another one of her books again.",negative

How can you not have a lot of laughs reading this? There are quite a few suspects in this mystery and each character has their place in the story. The setting is in an old southern mansion with lots of secret passageways in the walls. Each chapter brings you into a new aspect of the mystery. The authors did a very nice job with describing the settings in this story so well that you can almost feel the heat and humidity of the deep south. I definitely recommend this book to everyone who loves a great mystery with wonderful characters.",positive

"This book is fascinating but it took me a long time to read due to its textbook like material. Although, this is written in layman's terms, there is so much science packed into this text that it is hard for me to remember it all. <br /><br />The author trys to explain why nature and nurture lead to disease. The predominant topic discussed is the theory that our epigenetic inheritance, which is the ""biological transmission to offspring of changes to gene expression"" and our eipgnome, which is the ""network of compounds surrounding our genes, which interacts with our environment, althering gene expression in response to exrernal influences,""  determines our propensity for disease. Of course it is not as simple as this as our gut bateria, our childhood exposure to abuse and neglect, pathogens, pharmaceutical drugs, etc. affect disease progression as well.<br /><br />Based on this text, the science is just emerging. There is no definitive correlation with many of these theories except where numerous studies appear to support the various hypotheses.<br /><br />In summary, our risk for various disease is a result of our inherited genetics going as far back as our grandparents and the changes that get expressed in these genes based on our environmental impact such as nutrition, stress, sleep, gut bacteria, etc. This is an incredibly complex subject but the theories are somewhat uplifting because it appears we can, to some extent, change our genetics (nature) with our environment (nuture).<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because the subject matter is intense and mostly unproven theory. However, this book is well-written and is certainly facinating to those interested in why we each might suffer from different diseases.",positive

"Yarn manufacturers like Classic Elite publish knitting pattern books to sell yarn, but this usually means that the knitting patterns are highly ""commercial""--meaning that the  designs are above-average in attractiveness, and that the patterns are clearly written with relatively few errors.  With this book, Classic Elite adds a new level of technical or educational interest, by taking 20 ideas (e.g., a lace pattern, a short row technique, a Fair Isle star design, a ""fun and funky"" theme, an eyelet stripe, a jewel tones color scheme, a cable pattern, a textured stitch pattern) and then developing each idea into three variations.<br /><br />Sometimes the variations will be for three different scarves; sometimes for a wrap, a scarf, and a cowl; sometimes for three different wraps. The variations use different weights or types of yarn (e.g., lace weight, mohair, worsted weight, chunky).  For the technical knitter or the emerging knitwear designer, it's particularly interesting to look at and compare the photos of the variations, to see exactly how a single idea can be developed into quite different looks, depending on the choice of yarn fiber, weight, and color.<br /><br />CLASSIC ELITE SHAWLS, WRAPS & SCARVES is a book for the intermediate (or more experienced) knitter, because so many of the designs incorporate charted lace patterns or complicated multi-row stitch patterns.  Other than that, the patterns do not appear difficult to knit.  Although the patterns specify various Classic Elite yarns, the book includes complete gauge information, so that  a moderately experienced knitter can easily substitute other similar yarns in making the designs.<br /><br />With 60 total variations to choose from, it's hard to imagine not finding something worth knitting in this book!  However, because the patterns strike me as ""traditional"", without any one pattern standing out as particularly new or exciting, I rate this pattern book at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive

"This dark comedic mystery was well worth the suspension of disbelief it required a bit too often.  After a car accident in his rental the much misunderstood and notably annoying Denny Braintree finds himself mistaken for a long time resident of a small Vermont town.  This turns out to be convenient for our hero, sort of, when Denny becomes a suspect in a murder without a body and must assume the identity of his doppleganger.  I give  five stars to the character who is both totally off putting and endearing (how did Carkeet DO THAT?) His passion is model trains and when not working on his layout, which he never can do in this novel, or writing about model train layouts for a magazine, he's creating them in his mind, along with the perfect back story for each little figure.  He inevitably is too brash with people, makes puns they don't get and describes himself as intentionally oppositional because it's more exciting.  So if someone is mild-mannered, Denny gets loud and obnoxious with them and vice-versa.  There are many laugh out loud parts.  Most of the other characters are caricatures, but that works.  The plot was okay but as a mystery it was less satisfying than it was as a comedic novel.",positive

"This title was selected by my Book Club as one of our reads this year. Our theme was &#34;Georgia Authors/Subjects&#34;. Prior to reading this book, I was pretty indifferent about Paula Deen. I regularly make a couple of her recipes and I've been to her Savannah restaurant, but that's about the extent of it. I neither liked nor disliked her. After reading her biography, I can honestly say that I like her a whole lot more. Her life was not an easy one and she rose above all of her life's challenges and became very successful. It's written in her Southern Voice which was a little difficult for me because of the intentional misspellings and grammar issues, but it is effective. She is honest and shares all the good, the bad, and the ugly. It was an easy book to read and at the end of each chapter there's a recipe. There are a lot of photographs in the center of the book that I kept referring to as I read. Of course the book ends several years before all of the ugliness that surfaced in the media a few years ago. Maybe there will be an updated version later.",positive

And half of this *very* slim offering (Christmas lite??) is taken up by vintage photos.<br /><br />Older children will likely get a laugh out of the irreverent humor (leave it to Barry to work in scatological references to bat guano in a Christmas story), Doug's crush on a classmate, and familiar love story of a boy and his dog. There are laugh-out-loud moments to be found here, but Barry banks more on the nostalgia factor of a bygone era and familiar set pieces (the charming alternative lyrics to ""We Three Kings"" involving a rubber cigar) to create a ""Christmas Story"" mood of a dysfunctional suburban Christmas.<br /><br />For us grownups, this is a pleasant jaunt down memory lane that's sure to delight Dave Barry fans and any of us who need a little Christmas spirit to brighten our day. Happy Holidays!",positive
"Spoilers...I don't know if Jeph Loeb was forced to bring characters back from the dead or not by Marvel, but regardless, this Ultimate Comics X is one of the worst Ultimate books I've ever read. A lot of reviewers harp on Ultimates 3 and Ultimatum, but this is worse than those two hands down.<br /><br />Here's why. It's basically boils down to convenient story telling. I read the Ultimate universe because I feel it has more flexibility in areas such as killing characters, stressing relationships, etc. However, this story takes a huge step back from that.<br /><br />For example, in this run, the Ultimate Universe needs a new Wolverine since the original died. So, Wolverine had a son. Fair enough. He has bone claws. Cool! Let him ride with those for awhile. Nope. He can cover them in metal just like Colossus. What?!?! So, the Wolverine that died is basically back, but blonde. This happens again and again. We get the Blob back (as the original Blob's son) and we get Angel back (granted a little different from the original in the fact that it's a black teenager/twenty something with retractable wings). In short, three characters (or character types) that were dead are now back. This didn't have to happen, especially the Blob and Wolverine characters, or at least in the WAY that they did.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it one star is because Quicksilver questions Karen (Jean Gray's) ethics at the end (she would be very confused by this point in her life) which I liked and the fact that Karen (Jean Gray's) character was very well done overall.<br /><br />Hope that helps!",negative
"No surprises here:  for the most part, tattoo artists' drawings and paintings executed on paper and canvas, rather than on living human skin, bear a strong resemblance to tattoos.  However, for anyone interested in tattoo art, this is a worthwhile book, because most of it consists of full-color pages of artwork.  The book is a treat to look at.<br /><br />ART BY TATTOOISTS showcases the personal, conventional artwork of 26 expert tattooists, male and female.  Each artist's chapter of color plates is prefaced by a short interview, in which the artists talk about why they became tattooists, when they got their first tattoos, and what, if any, creative distinctions exist between their tattoo art and their more conventional--and perhaps more serious--other art.",positive

"This is one of the nicest books/cookbooks I have ever owned. Illustrated beautifully, the insight to the world inside Harry's Bar (and kitchen) is well worth any price. I ordered this book as I am planning a trip to Venice at the beginning of April (fifth time to Italy, first time to Venice) and I was curious as to what the foods would be like (and to try some recipes for myself in advance). This book does not fail to deliver both. It also comes beautifully packaged in a sleeve and makes for perfect gift giving. I can't want to seek out and find Harry's when I go there next year and, if I am lucky enough to meet the owner, will thank them profusely for putting this together. Bravo!",positive
"Legend City holds a lot of good memories for those in the Phoenix area and this book covers the theme park very well.  Legend City was our ""Disneyland"" (was modeled in part after Disneyland) and was the only major theme park ever build in Phoenix.  It has been gone for 30 years now, but is still very fondly remembered and this book covers the entire history of the park.  This is the second ""Images of America"" book that I have bought.  The first was a little disappointing, as it left out too much about the community it told about.  This one, however, seems to be quite complete.  Brought back many memories.  Should be interesting reading even for someone who never went to the park.  We had Legend City for 20 years, but now 30 years later after it's demise, this remains the largest city in the country without a theme park and the book explains probably why that is.  Good historical record of the rise and fall of an amazing, unforgettable theme park.  Note: pictures are all black and white.",positive

"CAT GOT YOUR DIAMONDS is an entertaining cozy mystery, by an author who thoroughly understands the genre.  It's the first novel in the &#34;Kitty Couture&#34; series--even though there are precious few cats.  Mostly the &#34;couture&#34; involves costumes for dancing dogs, performing chickens, and charity-connected llamas.  Presumably the subsequent series entries will feature more cats (including amateur detective Lacy Crocker's cat Penelope).<br /><br />In the novel, Lacy has returned to her hometown (New Orleans), in order to pursue her dream career as a designer of high-fashion costumes for pets.  In her shop on historic Magazine Street (&#34;Furry Godmother&#34;), Lacy sells clever pet costumes and accessories, as well as home-baked pet treats made from real, healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Lacy has extensive connections with the wealthy, socialite families of New Orleans, but wants to make it on her own.  Thus she is seriously short of operating funds for Furry Godmother.  When a hipster/derelict/criminal type (Miguel/Tony) burglarizes the shop, with Lacy inside, she sprays him with gold glitter and escapes out the back.  When she returns with the police, Miguel is dead from head trauma, and Lacy is arrested (temporarily) for murder.<br /><br />The arrest causes Lacy's White Knight investor to withdraw his financial support--and makes it imperative that she clear her name asap.  Her amateur investigations hamper the real murder inquiry being conducted by a drop-dead gorgeous detective (Jack); and the love interest and plot events develop from there.<br /><br />This is a well-plotted, entertaining cozy, if you can get past the concept of a heroine who makes her living by selling fashion costumes and treats for the pampered pets of wealthy New Orleans socialites.  (Fortunately, the cozy mystery is a forgiving genre.)  If you own a cat or dog, your pet may appreciate the included recipes for &#34;Pawlines&#34; and &#34;Tiny Tuna Tarts&#34;.",positive
"I have been reading Thich Nhat Hanh's books for 20 years and love them all!  Peace Is Every Step was the first book of Thay's (what TNH's students call him-means teacher in Vietnamese) that I read and it was a gift from my brother.  This is a wonderful, easy to read book and a good introduction into mindfulness practice.  It's the kind of book where you can open it to any page and read the teachings.  Each subject is usually just a few pages long so it's the kind of book you can keep in the bathroom to read a little bit a time :-).  Thay has such a wonderful way of explaining mindfulness in ""easy to understand"" terms in this book.  Practicing mindfulness meditation has changed my life.  Be warned:  Once you start reading one of Thay's books, you'll be hooked!!  :-)).  He is an amazing poet, writer and such a gentle, warm, funny, compassionate ""being"" that is so full of happiness and joy.  I highly recommend this book especially for people that are new the mindfulness practice.  I have given a number of ""Peace Is Every Step"" books to friends as gifts.  My book arrived in wonderful shape-<br />Enjoy the book-and remember to enjoy every moment :-))-",positive

"Wow.  Seventh Amos Decker!  I liked this one a lot, as Amos is paired with a new partner from Baltimore, an African American woman named Fredericka ""Freddie"" White.  The FBI folks he trusts and knows are gone and Amos is shaken that Alex has left for a post in New York and he is blindsided with a new partner.  They are immediately sent to Florida to address a murder of a Federal judge.  With lots of suspects, more than one death, an extremely successful corporation with some kind of involvement, a local agent who might or might not be too involved with local big wigs, trips to Miami and Key West and one golf community after another, the two have a lot on their plates and a lot of getting used to each other to do.  Freddie has a sympathetic backstory and a very supportive mother.  She quickly shows she's got great agent chops, but will Decker let her in?<br /><br />The audible version was entertaining.  I thought the narrator doing the women's voices was exceptional and the male narrator was very good, so satisfying and not jarring.  I've never noticed how often Baldacci has his characters, when talking about the case, repeat a bunch of the facts they've established or their theories.  I find that kind of annoying.  I definitely liked all the characters, the setting and thought the red herrings were pretty well done.  One solution was down to two possible people for me and that other was a wild card for me but still a decent resolution that I should have suspected and didn't.  Good book!",positive
"CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS: A NOVEL is written in economical prose--not the kind that Hemingway produced, but the dull, uninteresting kind. Even worse, the plot is all about slow-developing, slow-moving relationships among characters that are neither memorable nor compelling.  And of course, as a debut novel, it’s written with a first-person narrator.<br /><br />I ordered this book because of the Dublin setting (which hardly matters) and the advertised “best book” selections by Vogue, Slate, Elle, etc.  I have no idea why this novel would make anyone’s “best book” list, or why anyone would say that it doesn’t read like a debut novel.",negative

"My 17 year old daughter is a fan of the Wreck It style journals. She was very excited to get this one. It's definitely a good platform for getting her to think about some current topics and events. It encourages the reader to find their voice, of which I approve. Some of the activities are more passive than others. It does seem to lean toward one political side and although I personally agree with that side for the most part, I think that it would be more appropriate to have more of a neutral tone. We want our youth to be independent thinkers, so it makes sense that we shouldn't be showing bias toward any one side.",positive
"I do not belong to a CSA, but I try to grow my own veggies & Herbs, and go to my local farmers market.<br /> This book gives allot of information on fresh Vegetable recipes and a little with meat, all in full color.<br />I found this book fun and interesting to read.<br />The pages are thick, and seem like they can get a lite wiping down if they get dirty while cooking.<br /><br />There are times the box of Vegetables you get from your local CSA, you might not know how to cook some of them. Linda gives ideas & Recipes.<br /><br />There is information about her self,  and how she has learned (her Mother) how to cook using mostly all parts of the vegetables that most would probably throw out..<br />By learning about the often underutilized parts of plants, like the green tops of leeks or the yellow buds on kale, you’ll open yourself to a whole new range of vegetables.<br />There is a recipe called, Carrot top Salsa..<br />There is even a recipe on Pizza, and how to make the dough..<br /><br />She doesn’t use Organic, but I do. So when I made the Leek & Bacon breakfast pizza,(very good) I bought organic bacon etc., and organic veggies for her recipes.<br />I know that Radish leaves are awesome in salads etc. and healthier then the radishes!.<br /><br />If you want to learn more on how to cook different Vegetables, you will find most of these recipes fairly easy, and most likely you will have most of the ingrid. in your pantry, but the fresh veggies.<br />If your a Meat eater, you can use almost all of these recipes as your side vegetable dish, or incorporate the meat into the vegetables .<br /><br />Enjoy...",positive

"I really did not  enjoy this book much. It literally took me months to get through it. I'm somewhat amazed that it received so many 4 and 5 star reviews and made it to the best seller list. Although it did pick up some toward the end with a few unexpected twists and turns, overall, I found it quite a slow read. Moreover, I felt manipulated, as though the author was trying to push sentimental buttons rather than letting the truth (even if it's the fictional kind) carry the reader through the maze . I never believed that the fictional characters were sisters at all. The relationship never seemed real to me, try as hard as the author might to play upon certain sympathies. I did like the strength of the main character, Tracy Crosswhite, hence the 2nd star  We do need strong women who can stand up for themselves these days; however, I found it hard to bond with her or care much about her. Another reviewer mentioned the confusion created over character names, and I agree, there is some of that. There are certain letters and sounds that repeat in the author's choices. Plus, the author, perhaps feeling the need for variance, will jump between the use of first and last names for any given character.  I've never read this author's work before; frankly,  based upon this work, I'm not likely to try any of his others, at least not of this series.  I felt this was a waste of my time. There are so many other great writers out there.  This writer is not one of them.",negative
This is basically a nice little gift book filled with wisdom from Yoda. It's an official Disney DK collaboration. Each two sets of pages has a still movie picture on one side and some words of wisdom on the other side. A lot of the sayings remind me of positive inspirational work posters. I think this would make a great graduation gift along with some money. It's more of a light hearted kind of book rather than a serious one. My Star Wars fan husband found it amusing.,positive
"I understand that this is meant to be a book of pictures, cute ones, but I think I reached Pusheen overload by the fifth page.  There is no story about Pusheen, the comics aren't that cute either. I was expecting one story to be fun and touching, maybe just something short and sweet, but it was pretty abrupt,  and all the Pusheen'ness is pretty dull without the movement, you know, when Pusheen kneads things (which I freaking love).<br /><br />All in all a waste of fifteen minutes.",negative
"I hadn't known of Bernard Cornwell until I found this series, which I have enjoyed thoroughly.  Starting iwth this book, I now know much more abut the time of Alfred the Great, as seen through the eyes of Uhtred--son of a Danish mother and Saxon father.  Just that combination during these times when the Saxons and Danish/Norse invaders/settlers struggled for dominance of the British Isles was a good indicator of the complexity that develops in this character.  As a child of a local Saxon chieftan or lord, he was captured by the Danes when his father was killed and his uncle subsequently stole the stronghold and power due Uhtred.  He was brought up as a son of the Danish chief, learning Danish ways and thoroughly adopting their lifestyle and religion.  However, he became 'stuck' in defense of Alfred and his ambitions of becoming overlord of a Saxon 'England'.  Uhtred was a powerful fighter, having learned how the Danes approach battle fearlessly, and his skills were leashed by Alfred, despite Uhtred's dislike of the man personally.  This first installment of the series builds the story that was not a weak or boring one through all the books that followed.  Without a strong appreciation of the history of the times, unequaled description of how battles were fought strategically and shifting alliances could compromise territorial ambitions of the leaders, as well as strong character development of the principles, such a long series can't sustain interest.  Cornwell did not disappoint me in any part of the long saga.  In fact, this book, as the intro to this talented historical writer, led me to search out his other books of the European genre (medieval period) and I've now read every one and eagerly await what may come in future.",positive

The spelling mistakes begin on the cover and once again are found throughout this author's book. Diffrent? Really? As I've said in response to previous offerings by this author running his work past an editor who is fluent in English would go a long way towards making his books more readable.<br /><br />This time around we have a very short book that consists of a collection of pithy sayings the author has cobbled together from different sources. The 'book' is only fourteen pages long and has a fair layout. Credit appears to have been given to the authors at least but not the sources of the quotes. Unfortunately there are much better collections of quotes out there.<br /><br />The author once again contacted me to announce the book was free on Amazon and to request a review.,negative

"Definitely not a great &#34;feel good&#34; experience - most of these stories end far from the garden path or glorious sunset.  There is no doubt that they are well-written - beautifully written actually.  If you enjoy reading a collection of short stories just to appreciate the writing style, this may be for you.  What drives me crazy about a lot of short stories, is the way they dwindle off, leaving the reader wondering what in heck they are supposed to make of the ending.  You'll find that here.<br />Sorry - I appreciate good writing, but there have to be fleshed-out characters, well-described settings, and a story that grabs me and holds on.  I didn't find that here.",negative

"As someone who often roadtrips long distance with a dog or three, I was excited to get this book and read someone else's tales of tails on the road. In 25 years on the road around the country with my dogs, I've learned that there is almost always something funny or silly around the next corner. Traveling with dogs brings that out in me, my dogs and people we meet.<br /><br /> Alas, this is not even a little bit about a man and his dog. This is about a man and his arrogance and condescension towards other Americans who aren't from his type of town or dare to think/believe/live differently than the author. Poor ol Albie felt like an after thought the entire book and that made me sad. None of this trip had anything to do with the joy of events just for the dog. Overall, I came away from the book feeling sad.",negative
"The Quiet Beatle??  I don't think so, or, as the old saying goes, still waters run deep.  There was a lot going on beneath that calm exterior, including an often wicked sense of humor, deep thoughts on family, faith and societal  concerns, and sometimes a kind of righteous anger.  His spiritual journey both underpins and dominates his adult life, without apology, and his admirable desire to simply be a working musician, rather than an ego-driven Rock Star, make up a large part of his continued appeal.  Well-edited and a wonderfully interesting read.  Highly recommended to Harrison / Beatles / '60s & '70s rock fans.",positive

After one particularly heinous night that leaves Magnolia nearly dead, she finally sees her chance for escape…But this first taste of freedom is short-lived when she collides with Thirteen, head of the Network—a secret organization dedicated to fighting supernatural criminals—who recruits her into the group. Even as she’s coming to grips with this new life and the horrific memories that still haunt her, she’s conflicted by her growing attraction to fellow team member Theo and the emergence of new, untested abilities. After months of grueling training, her loyalty to the team is tested when she learns her target is the Network’s most wanted: the Kelch family. Revenge may course through her veins, but so does the blood of the Kelches. And opposing her family may cost her the thing she treasures most. After all, Magnolia is still a Kelch. And the Kelch are d*mned.",negative
"I like to finish a book with a &#34;wow&#34; - I'm afraid this time it was a &#34;whew&#34;.  I am still reeling from the story, which was a laborious account of a father trying to reunite with his sons, and a reunion of his sons with each other - long past the date of the expiration of the relationships.  As hard as you try, sometimes you just can't get family members to react in a way that conforms to the vision you are harboring.  Everybody has been working on his own agenda too long, and in this case - everyone is going off in his own direction.  This is an exemplary effort  at an epic novel;  the prose will cause you to stop and re-read passages.  The characters are clearly and intricately drawn, and illicit strong feelings of dislike or lack of empathy - my reaction.  For me to really get into a book, I have to find some common ground - some means to identify - and that was lacking.<br /><br />&#34;Big, brilliant and terrifically funny&#34; is how this novel is described.  For me, it wasn't.  Some novels aren't for everybody, obviously!",negative

"Probably the worst book I've read...ever. Overall, not very good writing, promotes archaic stereotypes, and, for such a short book, is very redundant.

"1880's Placerville California and gunslinger Tom Peterson who has survived into his 40's but has to keep his wits to ensure the safety of Mrs. Peterson. Reminded me of the 2nd class (they called them B movies) of the 1930's - dialogue a little stilted, bad guys named Black Bart, plot a little outlandish and lots of action. However they lost me on page 96 and prevented me from handing it to by 13 year old when our ex-Confederate Hero is told by an ex-slave, Isaiah 'Ike' Washington (after Ike has caught Tom nosing around his claim) that the Yankees ruined a good thing for him where he was the house man &#34;Had a good life, but damned Yankees had to make me free and ruin it…&#34;. Yeah, uh, no.<br /><br />THE GUNFIGHTER APPRENTICE - During an attempted robbery in a Nebraska frontier town, a young storekeeper, Matt McKay kills the brother of a murderous gang leader, Jack Moss. Fearing the outlaw's revenge, Matt's father takes him to Colorado and hires and once-feared gunfighter, Tom Patterson, to teach him the gun skills needed for self-defense and survival. For a sizable sum of money, Patterson accepts the task even though he views the young man too gentle and innocent to survive a gun battle with an accomplished killer. On his rundown ranch high in the Rocky Mountains, the gruff, older gunslinger imposes days of gun-handling practices, hoping to instill a killer instinct in the easygoing Matt.  In the nearby rowdy mining town of Gold Stream, Matt has the opportunity to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of his mentor. In eventful situations, Patterson's friends and enemies make Gold Stream a site of entertainment and danger. With the threat of the Moss gang's retribution ever present, Matt and Tom Patterson form a bond of mutual respect and resolve as they await a fatal showdown.",negative
"The author conducts a multi-year search for Dr. David Rosenhan's pseudopatients and the facts behind his research as it concerns his published 1972 article ""On Being Sane in Insane Places"" that made him famous.  He  brought to light the poor treatment and inaccurate diagnoses of the mental patients in the psych institutions of the late 1960's, supposedly by going undercover with a few other accomplices.  <br /><br />His research eventually influenced psychiatry and resulted in Dr. Robert Spitzer's contribution to the evolution of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is designed to make diagnosing mental illness more foolproof. It lists descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria  that helps doctors question and interact with a potential patient. However, such a rigid guideline also makes the interactions with those doctors more robotic.<br /><br />The author embarked on this research because she was inaccurately diagnosed with mental illness when what she had was a form of autoimmune encephalitis that was ""curable.""  This mis-diagnosis, in effect, supported what Dr Rosenhan's article said happened in these institutions. In the end, she discovers that Dr. Rosenhan's research was embellished and not entirely accurate. Despite this, his research caused us to review psychiatry as a whole and to realize that a lot of our medical diagnoses are subjective and not necessarily fact.  Dr. Rosenhan, in a sense, was a great pretender both in his life and his research.<br /><br />In summary, I found this very lengthy book to be a highly interesting read. It certainly makes one realize that not everything that is touted as a fact actually is one.",positive

"For over 50 years I have loved classic literature - Dickens, Austen, Thackeray, Wharton, James, Trollope and many more. For whatever reason, I had never read Wuthering Heights, so I was excited to finally buckle down and just do it. What a disappointment. Not a single sympathetic character. Just a litany of cruelty, manipulation, child and animal abuse. It left me depressed and wondering why I stuck with it to the end. And to top it off, I didn't find the writing style to be all that great. If you're looking for a good classic, I would keep moving.",negative
"Eve Duncan, forensic sculpture extraordinaire, is being stalked by a psychotic killer (Jelak) who believes he will become ""all powerful"" once he kills her and ""takes her blood"". Believing that he is some sort of vampire, Jelak kills women who he thinks are worthy, cuts their throats and drinks their blood from ornately decorated golden goblets. As the body count rises, so does their (Eve and her devoted, police detective husband Joe) determination to stop him.<br /><br />Meanwhile Eve and Joe are dealing with their own ""new set of problems"", which include recently acquired psychic powers (Joe can see ghosts and Eve can talk to her deceased 10-year-old daughter) and all the responsibilities/repercussions of having these gifts. Neither is comfortable with talking about their new gifts and it is causing a strain on their otherwise happy relationship. So with the help of Bonnie (Eve's deceased daughter), they will save each other and fight against a madman.<br /><br />Overall, this wasn't a terrible read, but a bit of a departure from the other Johansen novels that I have read. Her traditional formula or suspense and romance, has been changed now to include a sprinkle of the paranormal. And while I usually enjoy the hint of the paranormal, the transitions in this story were at times difficult to follow. There were storylines that should have converged smoothly to make a cohesive story but ended up disjointed and confusing. Joe's character moves from being angry that he can now see ghosts, not wanting or believing that he has this gift, to having aggressive sex with Eve, to full blown acceptance of his gift, as well as a mysterious stranger (Caleb) who seems powerful in his own right. And while it was interesting, I thought that some of the basic premises behind the storyline were unresolved.",negative

"I like the Little Letters little I Spy book more than I like most of the other I Spy board books. The letters book is easy, like the rest of the Little I Spy book, but finding a letter is a new and special challenge for my 2 year old.

"I had never heard of Martha Gellhorn before this book. She was a war correspondent, journalist, and writer in the 1940's and on. She was also the ex-wife of Ernest Hemingway and a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. This book is a compilation of letters to and from her lawyers, lovers, editors, etc. It is amazing what one can learn from reading their correspondence. I found her letters interesting and it gave me a good breadth of the actual person behind those writings. <br /><br />This book took me several months to read in increments of 30 minutes to 2 hours per day and that is the best way I find this is read. For me, this is not one of those books I could read right through.",positive
"I have read some Peter Straub books that I absolutely love, like, for instance, Ghost Story. Then there is this book.

"I just have to say that, while the book is most likely entertainment for those who enjoy a certain genre, the writer's attempt to reinvent his own personal history (I am speaking to his ""About the Author"" both here and on the publisher's site) is sad at best and hilarious at worst.",negative
"My daughter is a junior in high school, so this is the year she will be taking the SAT. This book will be very helpful as she prepares for the test. It's broken into different subject categories. There are several example questions. I was especially impressed with the answer portion because it doesn't just give the correct answer, it gives tips and reasoning for why the answer is correct. I remember having buying an SAT review book back in the 1985. The answers were provided, but that's all. There was no explanations given to help you understand the answer. Plus, my review book was basically just a practice test. My daughter has taken the PSAT once a year since 8th grade, so she's gotten practice taking the test. I think having access to a variety of practice questions and being able to understand why an answer is wrong or right is more helpful to her at this time. The way the book is laid out, I think it would be easy to do it in chunks as your time allows. Overall, I think this is a great tool for test preparation.",positive

"Some assembly required!  KRUSTEAZ CINNAMON CRUMB CAKE & MUFFIN MIX tastes good, but requires more preparation steps than you expect from a cake or muffin mix.  If you're making crumb cake, you have to layer the cake mix and crumb topping, swirl the batter with a knife, and then sprinkle on a final layer of crumb topping.  If you're making muffins, you have to fold half the crumb topping into the cake mix, and then sprinkle the remaining crumb topping on top.<br /><br />My husband loved these.  I loved the cake part, but felt that the cinnamon/sugar/crumb topping was too sweet.  However, you can't really go wrong with Krusteaz mixes, particularly [[ASIN:B0016BU7AK Krusteaz Banana Nut Muffin Mix)]] and [[ASIN:B0016BU7GO Krusteaz Cranberry Orange Supreme Muffin Mix]].<br /><br />For a crumb cake or 12 standard muffins, you need one egg, 2/3 cup water, and one package of the mix.

"Kristi Bentz has awakened from a coma and is trying to move on with her life. Having survived the attack of a madman (one of several) in the last novel (Absolute Evil), Kristi believes she can now see the future deaths of those she comes into contact with. Packing her things and leaving the comforts of home, Kristi heads to All Saints College to complete her education. Meanwhile, All Saints is experiencing a rash of missing girls; an increase in enrollment in some courses about vampirism; girls carrying their blood around their necks in vials; chat rooms; bloody martinis; and other dark issues. As Kristi decides that part of her education will include solving the ""All Saints Missing Girls"" case and writing a book, she finds that her life is in danger. Hoping to exclude her father from the investigation, Rick Bentz is dealing with other issues that include a wife who has a desire that he isn't ready to address; and a daughter who wants to grow up while placing herself in danger. There were a lot of things to like about this novel, the killer wasn't really original, but the motivation had tons of potential. A group of people who have varying degrees of dependence was extremely creative although I thought that there were things that could have been added and things that needed to be deleted. So when the ""demons"" are deleted, was I satisfied...somewhat, but would I get the next story in the series ""Malice"", I am not sure. This one was somewhere between a 2.",negative

"I consider myself a die-hard Celine Dion fan ever since hearing her French-language [[ASIN:B000007U0Q Incognito]] (1987) album. I own all of her French-language recordings (including out-of-print LPs and singles from 1981-1988), have watched her early French music videos and numerous French-language biographies and TV specials, and have read her official [[ASIN:0007104081 MY STORY, MY DREAM.]] biography several times.<br /><br />When I saw Celine Dion: For Keeps, I bought it to round out my collection, erroneously thinking that when it came to Celine's early years in Quebec, I'd seen / heard it all. Not so.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />Similar to [[ASIN:B000IAZP16 The Sinatra Treasures: Intimate Photos, Mementos, and Music from the Sinatra Family Collection]], Celine Dion: For Keeps features rare photos and removable reproductions of important documents from Celine's career and personal life, such as an early Quebecois report card, the handwritten sheet music to her audition song Ce n'etait qu'un reve (written by her mother), tour schedules, Grammy nomination letters, and even a copy of Celine's ultrasound (translations are provided for all French documents).<br /><br />There are recollections that I'd never heard before, such as Celine touring the mall circuit in Quebec during her earliest years as a fledgling artist, and many remembrances from acquaintances, fellow celebrities, and music personalities. This combined the appeal of a text-only biography with multimedia; my only wish would have been for a CD with rare / unreleased performances as was done with the Sinatra Treasures collection.",positive
"After thoroughly enjoying the first 2 books in this series, I was eager for this one. I actually reread both it’s predecessors so everything would be fresh in my mind. What a disappointment! In this volume, Cromwell lacked all the humanizing touches that had made his character so compelling and likable. Events no longer revealed the characters but came across more like dry facts included by the author for historical accuracy. I found it impossible to immerse myself into the lives and events; the characters I’d grown to know and care for in the previous 2 books had become strangers. I made it about 1/3 of the way through the book before setting it aside and moving on to other stories, although I continued to read a little nearly every day until I eventually made it to the end. I was glad when it was over and almost felt like I deserved a reward—-which is sad. Normally finishing a good book is reward enough in itself! And then there’s that regret that the author missed the opportunity to finish the series with the same qualities and excellence that were present in the preceding two books. Too bad we can’t get a do-over!",negative

"KNITTED TEDDY BEARS: DRESSED WITH HANDKNITS has simple patterns for small (10""), medium (13""), and large (17"") bears.  I purchased this book because I thought the clothes (including undergarments!) were cute.  Nearly all of the clothing patterns are modeled in the cover photograph and the ""Look Inside This Book"" feature, which show the jacket, coat, overalls, sweater (striped version), and pants.  In addition, the book has patterns for an undershirt, boxer shorts, a scarf, a charming lacy dress, and a delightful pants suit with a lacy tunic.<br /><br />The patterns are written in row-by-row instructions.  This means that if you use the same yarn and needles for the basic bear and the clothing, the clothing will be sure to fit.  The bears are knit on double-pointed needles:  for the large bear, size US 8; for the medium bear, size US 4; for the small bears, sizes US 1.5 or US 2.5.  For the yarns used in the models, the brand names are given, but not the specific yarn gauges.  You can substitute any yarn that states on the label that it is suitable for knitting on the needle size you use.  The patterns recommend stuffing the bears with wool (but I would at least try stuffing mine with polyester fiberfill).<br /><br />This is quite a slender volume:  just 68 pages (including two pages for ""Notes"").  Because the book is so short, and has such a limited number of clothing patterns, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive
"I really enjoyed Laura McBride's ""We Are Called to Rise.""  Set in Las Vegas, this novel uses four interrelated narrators to tell an unforgettable story.  Avis, the first narrator, is a 53-year-old woman who is suddenly left by her husband.  As her story unfolds, we see her love for her child has blinded her to reality.  The second narrator is Bashkim, an 8-year-old Albanian boy living with his parents and baby sister in Las Vegas.  His story reflects the struggle of immigrants to integrate into American society and to comprehend its culture.  The third narrator, Luis, is a soldier recovering from severe PTSD and an attempted suicide at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington DC.  He witnessed the horrors of the war in Iraq, and has both physical and psychological trauma to deal with.  Finally, the fourth narrator, Roberta, is a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) volunteer.  Her place in the story will give away too much of the plot, so I will say little about her.<br /><br />The lives of all these characters begin separately but eventually intertwine.  I loved the writing, especially in the first half of the book.  The characters seemed realistic, and their situations uniformly heartbreaking.  Toward the end, I felt that the author lost the voice of Bashkim, as he began to think and say things that seemed well beyond an 8-year-old.  However, this did not spoil the book for me, and I think readers will come to love Bashkim perhaps more than any other character.<br /><br />This book will appeal to anyone who wants to read a thoughtful reflection on many of the issues we currently confront in America.  Among them are domestic violence, grief, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their devastating effects on the men and women who fought them, our immigration system and its failures, and the lack of connection we have in our communities.  I really liked this book, and it deserves 4.5 stars.  Highly recommended.",positive
"If one buys this book expecting an account of 22SAS's fight against the Provos during the 'Troubles' in Ulster as I did, you'll be unhappy.<br />It's basically a recounting of 'ALL' (oh suuure!) the secret agencies activities in Ulster from the late 70's onwards but only a portion is focused on the 'ice cream boys' and even that is heavily, heavily tinged with the author's prejudices of whether one is permitted to shoot a terrorist or not.<br />(After all, killers have feelings too).<br />As an academic exercise - two out of five stars (Additional to the obvious pro-gunman sympathy of the author there were several large inaccuracies presented as factual.

"Normally a book this length takes me a couple days to read. I struggled with this book, picking it up, getting bored, annoyed or disgusted and then putting it down and walking away repeatedly for over a full week.<br />I couldn't find one character in this tale that I cared even the slightest about. They're all fairly well messed up, self absorbed, neurotic or otherwise damaged. Even the kids are annoying especially the one who wrote an entire (overly long!) chapter in a Power Point slide show which mostly discussed her brother's obsession with and the cataloging of rests/pauses in songs. While these people felt real, I've met several neurotics who matched quite well the quirks of the people in this book I just couldn't care about them.<br />Worst of all and one of my major pet peeves the narrative jumps around not only in time (we often have NO idea where in time we are during the story) it also jumps narrative styles. We go from an objective narrator to first person and in one chapter the story is being told TO the reader as if they're one of the characters in the book. I found it disjointed, convoluted, frustrating and very annoying.",negative

"Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store and I feel like she totally got ripped off.  Not at all reusable like the cover claims.  The stickers are less sticky, so you can reuse them once or twice at best.  But still, 75 stickers for this is still seriously overpriced.

"WITH MY HANDS:  POEMS ABOUT MAKING THINGS is a pleasant, beautifully illustrated children’s picture book.  It has short poems about “making” and “being a maker”, as well as about individual crafts (e.g., soap carving,  building a cardboard spaceship, origami, baking cookies, etc.).  The poems emphasize making things that are uniquely one’s own, and describe the feelings associated with creative craft activity.<br /><br />The poems usually include rhyming elements, though they aren’t slavishly rhyming.  The metre is awkward in spots in many of the poems.  (I would like this book much more if it weren’t for the metre issues.)<br /><br />The poems about specific crafts vary in quality.  For example, I think that “Knitting” misses the mark. (It would be fine if it didn’t include the trite reference to “clicking-clacking” of needles.  My knitting needles don’t click, so I wonder whether the poet has tried knitting.)<br /><br />Overall, the book deserves good marks for encouraging creativity in young children.",positive

"This story seems to have a premise that the author believed in.  Its not poorly written, although I think the MC was not relatable in any way.<br /><br />But its also about a strange female dominated world where men are kept in chains (in more ways than just physical) and with some strange fetishes that definitely weren't for me.<br /><br />I just couldn't really wrap my head around the premise for the world itself.  I could see the world building, and it was more solid than most I come across recently, but it was a world that my mind rejected quickly.  Unfortunately if you reject the world building, the rest of the story tends to fall flat, and that happened here.  With the foundation of the story not to my liking, I couldn't find the entertainment.<br /><br />Others will like the matriarchal society with the strange enforcement and history, but it wasn't for me and sadly, that leaves me giving the tale just 2 stars.  I find that I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.",negative
"This book is absolutely nothing like I expected. After reading that this novel is &#34;An alternately charming and horrifying exploration of what it means to be human and how far we'll go in pursuit of personal and societal 'perfection,&#34; I thought I was going to read a non-fiction work exploring what people do to themselves (plastic surgery, implants, designer babies, use of stem cells, sperm donation, etc.) to enhance their appearance or have a &#34;designer&#34; child. However, this is NOT that at all. Instead &#34;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful ...&#34; is a FICTION work of some phantasmal creation in the author's psyche where she explores several scenarios (she says six but I thought there were more) of how people alter themselves over time.<br /><br />The book starts out with a boy and girl who are semi-identical twins. I got the impression that they were once co-joined but cannot be absolutely certain from the story. However, the boy lives and the girl dies but the boy gets her parts (heart, liver, part of her large intestine, kidneys, and pancreas).  From this story evolves several more chapters of other stories whereby near the end of the book we have humans with bird wings, extra toes and eyes and legs, moving tattoos, etc., etc.<br /><br />I found the first few chapters difficult to follow but after I got into the book, I absolutely loved it and could barely put it down. I personally avoid reading FICTION unless I am tricked. In this case I was tricked by that one introductory sentence above. Nevertheless, this novel makes one think that the human race could eventually evolve into this and to some extent we are not far off.  Just Google the artist Simon Huck who produces fake human &#34;skin&#34; implants that the stars like Kim Kardashian wear as jewelry and it is like &#34;experiencing&#34; a prelude to this book.",positive

"The main character called Maxim and he happens to have a rather large house and estate in Cornwall with a house keeper called ""Danny""... anyone else getting ""Rebecca"" by Daphne du Maurier vibes?<br /><br />In her new novel ""The Mister"", we first meet Maxim Trevelyan, an English earl with a newly inherited estate in Cornwall following his elder brother's unexpected death, whose first page of interior monologue is a narcissistic ode to “mindless sex"". Not exactly the best way to try to make the reader feel anything other than loathing for the main character and unfortunately he doesn't get much better.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, Maxim, a 28-year-old aristocratic playboy whose elder brother Kit has just died, is now obliged to step in and start fulfilling his role as heir to the Trevethick estate (get used to that name as it is almost a regular occurrence on every page). He is irritated by his inheritance as that means giving up his nocturnal habits of playing house music at nightclubs in Hoxton (a trendy part of east London for hipsters and creatives) and using his good looks to sleep with in his words, “hot, skinny women.” But one morning his world is unexpectedly turned upside-down even more when his regular maid is replaced by Alessia Demachi, whose entrance jolts Maxim into an uncharacteristic pattern of keeping his P in his pants. As it turns out Alessia not just a cleaner but an illegal immigrant from Albania that is trying to escape her ""previous life"" and she is about to drag Maxim into her dark world.<br /><br />This is definitely a case of don't judge a book by it's cover (which was what caught my eye and made me buy the book). If only the story line was half as interesting as the cover it would have been worth the money paid and the time wasted reading it.",negative
"I don't know if I would say it is the worst book I have ever owned, but it certainly falls down there with the bottom feeders!  First, most of the stuff the author put in there is simple common sense.  To remind the user that point-and-shoot cameras are easier to carry on vacation... uh... hate to inform you, but that is kind of a ""no brainer.""  I don't think people lug their DSLR cameras and lenses on vacation because of convenience and size.  My next big beef is the pictures... man oh man... these have to be the worst pictures I have ever seen in a so called ""photography"" book.  Didn't the editors take a look at this book before they decided to pay the author and market it?  Seriously, this book is terrible.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.

"Azaria as a dungeon had a ton of power.  Lance as this wandering dungeon diver with ""absorption"" abilities had a ton of power.<br /><br />So, the only solution was to create even more powerful enemies and rip the entire city of Neo-Chicago from the surface of the planet.  Now Azaria must exercise even more power, and Lance's ever increasing abilities dwarf those of any other being on the planet.<br /><br />I wanted to vomit.  I hate this kind of writing.  This story ran straight into one of my biggest complaints in that too much power was handed out to the ""heroes"" which resulted in the villains having to be far too powerful as well and the plot becomes a mess in seconds.<br /><br />This story was very much a problem of a like v like conflict where the original side was already overpowered.  In a clash of titans, you end up with the monsters fighting blindly while flattening the world around them.  (think Godzilla v any monster in the older Kaiju films from Japan.  The humans are mere spectators as entire cities get stomped on.)<br /><br />I don't like this kind of story.  It works with Godzilla because of the nature of the tale.  Godzilla is not really a character, but rather a force of the plot that moves around and guides the story as the humans who are the real characters must react to him.  In this series of Doll Dungeon, Azaria is clearly thought of as a major character, but she's too powerful to really be one.  And her dungeon is not a factor.  She does use her powers to protect Neo-Chicago, but we actually never get to see much of her third floor.<br /><br />I just didn't care for this tale and by the time Azaria is marshalling her forces to assault another dungeon I had lost interest.  The chaos and the power levels just distorted the plot.<br /><br />I don't want to really speculate as to why this book did so poorly for me, but it did.  I cannot recommend this to anyone.",negative

"This book seems to have just enough introduction to make this book useless for making your own graphic novel, because it would start after 15 pages of brief instruction.  And it is not deep enough in instruction to make it a deep how to book.  It actually seems to have become something of a sketch book for my youngest son who wants to make a comic book.  I guess what I really need is two books.  One, a clean book with just an empty canvas of boxes, and one that is a more in depth introduction to the art of making graphic novels.<br /><br />But, I have to say that I like this book, because he has been filling it with sketched panels and storylines and it has been great for laying out ideas.  So it is well worth it for a sketch book with a narrow section of instruction.",positive
"In many ways, this word search book is nicer than I expected. The pages are a thick paper. The pages are double sided. I use highlighters when working in word searches. The pages are thick enough that I haven't noticed any bleed through. I've only used yellow highlight so far, but I am pleased. The book is divided into 3 sections - easy, moderate, and difficult. I would say that those divisions are accurate. I wasn't sure they would be. I actually made a mistake in the difficult section. I was looking for ""Argentina"". I thought I found it so I highlighted it. Turns out I highlighted ""Argentin"". There were a couple of other words that had the same trickery. I learned to be more careful! Overall, it's a good quality word search filled with 300 puzzles. That should keep me busy for quite a while!",positive

I have not had time to sit down and seriously study with this book as I have been more focused on basic grammar and learning vocabulary, but my next challenge will be to increase my  productive and receptive knowledge of the kanji.  I feel like the method presented in this book will be successful for me  where other methods were not.",positive
"Terry Trueman's Stuck In Neutral was inspired by his son Sheehan, who has cerebral palsy, is not able to communicate, and has been labeled profoundly developmentally disabled. Trueman recently penned [[ASIN:1425762549 Sheehan: Heartbreak and Redemption]], about his own personal struggle with his son's severe cerebral palsy that inspired Stuck in Neutral. Trueman's protagonist Shawn McDaniel is in much the same boat; he's unable to communicate or control any of his muscles, including his eyes, and even his family has chalked him up as profoundly retarded.<br /><br />But Stuck in Neutral, told from Shawn's point of view, reveals a witty narrator with a photographic memory and a zest for life, even if he's not able to communicate it to his family. There's not a trace of self-pity, even though he's at the mercy of family and caretakers for everything from feeding to bathrooming, and he's in a class of profoundly retarded classmates. The plot revolves around the suspicion that Shawn's father is planning to kill him out of ""mercy"" for Shawn's suffering and his ever-present seizures.<br /><br />The binding link that weaves throughout the story centers on his father's poem about young Shawn that won numerous awards including the Pulitzer. Now his father, who deserted the family years ago, is a celebrity for his poem that presents Shawn as a helpless, pitiable object, not the funny, smart teenager that he's become, if only in his head, and his father seems inspired by a recent ""mercy killing"" of another handicapped child.<br /><br />Trueman does a masterful job of leaving the ending open (he penned a novel written from Shawn's brother Paul's perspective, [[ASIN:B000B5RXWC Cruise Control]], that explores Paul's feelings towards his brother and his situation, which is also open-ended in its final decision), and Shawn is an utterly hip, real narrator that shows us how easy (and dangerous) it is to judge someone based on appearances.",positive
"Really thought this was going to be enjoyable since I have read previous titles by this author and loved them. I just didn't get this one. It seemed to me as though the main character might be just about as deranged as the killer and I just didn't get that happy feeling of wanting to root for the success of anyone in this book. I almost think in some way I liked the killer better than the hero and heroine because at least that character was designed to make the reader feel revolted and actually completed the mission. I didn't absolutely hate it, but I found it kind of long winded and disappointing. Not the best Nora Roberts out there. I wouldn't recommend making this the first Nora Roberts title you read if you are new to her work.",negative
"From the title I would have thought this book was only about Dr. DeVincentis patients but he also talks about his own animals.  I loved the array of stories and his compassion.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because the arrangement of the last story was sort of out of place. For instance, he talks about his new dog Billie after his previous dog Cotton dies. You are treated to life with Billie through the previous chapters and then in the last chapter he brings you back to how he acquired Billie.<br /><br />Other than this, the book is an enjoyable and heartwarming read.",positive

From an interview by the author she describes she wanted to do a story where the story carries a point of view of the horse and where the horse is the bad boy of the story, so the story is told by both Merritt and Red.",negative
"In DAMAGED (A ROSATO & DINUNZIO NOVEL), it’s obvious that author Lisa Scottoline has boned up on the law relating to child protective services, guardianship, and child custody.  Unfortunately, there’s so much law in this book, it seriously interferes with the reader’s enjoyment of the book as legal thriller fiction.  You can buy a law book if you want that much information.<br /><br />Even worse, family lawyer Mary DiNunzio is the most unbelievable lawyer I’ve ever encountered in mystery/thriller fiction. In real life, family lawyers who represent children encounter heartbreaking situations on a regular basis—and something that family lawyers do NOT do is begin proceedings to be themselves named a child-client’s guardian after the child’s only known relative dies unexpectedly.<br /><br />Mary’s falling in love with the child after meeting him only once makes the novel’s premise even crazier.  Mary’s only excuse is her “hormones”, because she happens to be planning her upcoming wedding to Anthony.  The wedding is only days away.<br /><br />DAMAGED is the fourth in the Rosato & DiNunzio series.  (The first novel in the series is [[ASIN:1250027659 Accused: A Rosato & DiNunzio Novel]]; the series itself is a continuation of the “Rosato and Associates” series.)  The novel works all right as a standalone, but despite the overabundance of legal instruction, it's mostly about relationships and wedding planning.  Because DAMAGED is such an unbelievable legal thriller, I rate it at a generous 2 stars (&#34;I don’t like it” on the official Amazon scale).",negative

"Six months ago Clare Lancaster discovered the body of her brother-in-law, Brad McAllister, and quickly became a suspect. A human lie detector, Clare knows or senses that all is not as it seems with those closest to the investigation. Clare, the newly discovered illegitimate daughter of Archer Glazebrook is considered an outsider and an unstable sensitive. Sent to discover just what is going on in Arizona, the very sexy/mysterious J&J Agent, Jake Salter, must dig deep and get to the truth about Brad's death, a mythical drug believed to enhance psychic powers, all while struggling to understand his growing feelings for Clare. As the body count rises, so does the passion between the two driven together by danger. When the killer is revealed, you won't be extremely surprised but mildly amused. I had a great deal of hope for this series, but now am not sure if I will merely read it to see how the eventual plot unfolds or if I will read it just to finish the series. I have two short criticisms, I am not sure I can take another Krentz book that mentions ""long leather coats, and high-heeled black boots. While this is only my third Krentz novel, more specifically the Arcane Society, I definitely see a varying theme....instead of giving so much detail about the beautiful heroine's clothing, maybe give a little more substance so that when certain plots are revealed, you will savor them. Also, some of the plots end abruptly and while I know that there is going to be a sequel, the way it is done leaves me feeling a bit unsatisfied.",negative
"Billed as a ""First Favorite Tale"", this version is not one I would read to very young children as an introduction to this timeless classic.<br /><br />While nicely illustrated, there are several strange deviations from the story I grew up with, and since I'm sure everyone already knows the plot, a few spoilers may be permissible here.<br /><br />Firstly, the pigs leave their mother's house purportedly to see the world, but before they are out of sight of the apron strings, they commandeer prime roadside real estate and begin construction of dwellings, some of which are certainly not up to building code spec.<br /><br />Secondly, it's become a little too politically correct, as the second little pig has now become female, with a little flower in her hat and a burning desire to live in a house made of sticks, which of course she constructs with her bare hands.<br /><br />Thirdly, and very disturbingly, the pigs that are huffed and puffed at, and made homeless by the big bad wolf do not scamper off to safety, but meet their tragic ends in the form of wolf snacks.<br /><br />Fourthly, my four year old was very surprised that the wolf bothered to huff and puff at a brick wall, when the illustration shows the third pig relaxing behind a very large glass door, which would have provided a much more convenient entryway for a blowhard wolf.<br /><br />Then, to make the story longer, the remaining pig and the wolf start making little play dates, with the pig outsmarting the wolf three times using the same method.<br /><br />Finally, after besting the wolf at the final showdown, the last pig dances around enjoying his fine house of bricks without a tear of remorse for his fallen siblings.<br /><br />Call me old fashioned, but I prefer the happier version, as this one is just too violent for the intended audience.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 20, 2005",negative
"I really enjoyed [[ASIN:B00LYXED0A The Honest Folk of Guadaloupe]] by this author, in which the story was told from multiple viewpoints, with flashbacks, and had to be pieced together by the reader. The description of Guadaloupe itself and its political/judicial system was beautifully done, and was part of the novel's appeal.<br /><br />The plot of THE SECOND DAY OF THE RENAISSANCE (INSPECTOR TROTTI) unfolds in a similar disjointed, obscure fashion, but it was too much for me this time.  I’m never fond of flashbacks, and the ones here were maddening.  When Trotti answers a summons from an old police friend, who warns Trotti that a contract killer is after him, the flashbacks come one after another, just piling up, as the friend is constantly interrupted and then doles out miniscule bits of information after each interruption.  Trotti keeps asking the friend to come to the point, but the friend insists on passing along his information in his own way, taking his own sweet time.  Like Trotti, the reader wishes that the friend would just get on with it.<br /><br />Even after I was well into the novel, I had no idea what Trotti had done to warrant being targeted by a hit man, or what all the various people and scenes described in Trotti’s flashbacks had to do with each other or the plot.  Trotti himself is an unattractive, depressing character.  The descriptions of Italy lacked the charm of the ones in &#34;Honest Folk&#34;, and weren't enough to salvage this novel.",negative

"While the Amazon title doesn't promise this, the cover of the book says these are reusable stickers.<br /><br />Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store because I suggested another reusable sticker book (our son loves the Melissa and Doug Reusable Sticker Book... link below).

After that, they loose all stickiness.<br /><br />So beyond the fact that it isn't reusable at all, I also feel like she got ripped off.

This reader accomplishes none of those things. They put a cute character on it so kids will like it, but don't make the content what it should be. This book would be an appropriate reader for a child that is already ready fluently, not a beginner. It is just a cheap picture book with a lacking story line and a popular character, which, in my opinion does not make it good beginning reading material.

"This book makes for an easy and quick read about Jeremy Lin, who recently has been in the news. There is a story to tell here, worth telling because I think it does provide a feel-good human interest portrait. Here are some points which I take from the book...<br />1. Jeremy's maternal grandparents came to the US from Taiwan. His mom enrolled at Old Dominion College in VA and studied computer science where she met his dad. They married then moved to Purdue U. in Indiana so the dad could get his PhD and where mom got introduced to a Christian fellowship group there. Then moved to LA, then Florida, finally settling in Palo Alto, CA, parents working in Silicon Valley.<br />2. Jeremy's dad had become a basketball junkie and got Jeremy involved with youth basketball teams in Palo Alto, though academics would always come first.<br />3. Parents each 5'6"", so Jeremy would drink lots of milk and take calcium supplements, eventually reaching 6ft in HS and as a Sr. being a point guard, team won Division II CA state championship, Jeremy being named to the CA All-State team.<br />4. Received no Div. I college scholarships (his skills don't show up in statistics), but was accepted to Harvard and went there with some financial aid.<br />5 Led Harvard to a 21-8 senior season, growing to 6ft 3+ inches. Golden State Warrior owner knew Jeremy form his youth basketball days, so gave him a 2-year contract, then claimed off waivers by the Knicks where he met success after Carmelo Anthony was injured and the Knicks had a guard problem and Carmelo suggested giving Jeremy a chance to play. Then Jeremy created headlines while maintaining devotion to Christianity, similar to Tim Tebow of football.<br />So, a nice true story.",positive

"""You Can Write Poetry"" is very good at breaking down the technical structures comprising poems including definitions, examples, along with practice exercises. Included are meters, foot, stanzas, verses, rhymes, sounds, figures of speech, sonnets and ballads.

In fact, I think the glossary is a handy checklist for any aspiring poetry writer to use when revising a poem.<br /><br />The book emphasizes that poems aren't about truth.

What I found out was that so much of the book doesn't really deal with actual pressure cooking.  There is a section in there that talks about slow cookers/crock pots, one for pressure canning and one for pressure cooking.  What it doesn't really deal with is adapting any of your current recipes to pressure cookers, so that was a big disappointment. I really wasn't looking for a crockpot book.  What's more is there is really not a whole lot of recipes either.  I own many other pressure cooker books and they are far better than this one.  Most of the other pressure cooker books out there have enough basics that a person that is new to pressure cooking can learn from them and they are loaded with recipes.  They are focused only on pressure cooking instead of all over the map like this one.  I would invest in these.  My two favorite books are Cooking Under Pressure and Pressure Perfect.  I would invest my money in these books instead.",negative

"I purchased this book along with [[ASIN:1421414279 Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis]] because I wanted to learn more about RA.<br /><br />I like that this manuscript is short and touches on some RA symptoms, the importance of diet, etc. However, the main issue I have with this text is that it is POORLY written and POORLY edited. There was one sentence that just ended in the middle and the rest of the sentence was nowhere to be found. Another section mentioned &#34;Rolfing&#34; but said RA patients should NOT use this so it was not going to be discussed. In this case, the author should have at least written a sentence on what &#34;Rolfing&#34; is. (PS It is manipulation of the connective tissue; a type of massage.)  Also, after the first chapter every page had several formatting / editing errors such as no spaces between words, periods and commas where they don't belong, etc. The English is poor as well. I kept thinking this was the author's second language.<br /><br />Had this not been so poorly written, I would have rated this three stars. I learned a little from this book but nothing that made it worth the purchase.  However, all these errors and the disjointed text left me seething and so  disappointed that I wish I could get my money back.<br /><br />PS I attached a picture of the first two paragraphs on Page 80 as an example. The marked up areas are where the mistakes are and my attempt to correct them.<br /><br />UPDATE Oct 8, 2016: I contacted Amazon and they issued a full refund since this was totally unsatisfactory.

"I purchased both the ([[ASIN:0981994644 More Chat Pack Cards: New Questions to Spark Fun Conversations]] and the [[ASIN:0975580167 Chat Pack: Fun Questions to Spark Conversations]] (this set)  to add variety to my vacation time with my boyfriend. Both he and I liked how these cards stimulated conversations and allowed us to think and get to know details about each other that we did not know even though we have been together for 15 years.<br /><br />Each card is the size of a tiny Post-It note at 1 inch x 3-1/2 inches. In this package are questions such as:<br /><br />- Thinking back to all the great TV series finales that you have seen over the years, which show do you believe had the best final episode?<br />- If snow could fall in any flavor, what flavor would you choose?<br />- Which age, when you turned it, was the most difficult for you to accept?<br /><br />Some questions made us think on the fly and make stuff up. This means that if we were answering this question again, we would give a different answer because we never actually thought about that particular question. There are some questions that were difficult to answer. For instance, I do not watch TV or movies much so I could not answer any questions related to the best movie sequel because I did not know any. One is encouraged to change up the questions if necessary.<br /><br />Overall, we found this both fun and entertaining and only got though part of each pack.

"This was my first Michael Palmer read, and from the accolades, I was expecting something exceptional.  Resistant had an exceptionally imaginative premise, a good story that moved right along, characters that were well-fleshed out, settings that transported, but, instead of enjoying the novel, I was distracted by the political aspects.  It was difficult to read without feeling disappointed that the author of a really good book had to make his political leanings so apparent.  I've read many a non-fiction book dealing with present and past politics - and I enjoy them for what they are.  I expect to deal with the political bent of the writer.  When it comes at me packaged as a novel, I don't anticipate feeling defensive while I'm reading!<br />So, I didn't finish the book, which is a rare thing for me.  If you don't share my delicate sensibilities, you will probably enjoy this book.  It is well-written, and I can understand why it was well-received by the publishing community.",negative

"I purchased this book specifically to get the aran scarf pattern, but it is loaded with great knitting projects!  It has a wipe-clean hard cover and wirebound interior pages and lies flat for pattern reference.  It's separated into three sections: Knitting for Babies, Great Gifts and Fabulous Scarves.  These are prefaced by a 32-page section with clear, simple, step-by-step instructions on how to knit from casting-on (including various methods) to garment completion and beyond.  It even covers correcting mistakes, felting, crocheting and many, many other topics.  If you are a beginning knitter, the front section is a great reference how-to.  I highly recommend this book.",positive

There was basically no storyline worth almost 400 pages - this should have been a novella. The story dragged on and on with immaterial, daily life stuff and conversations and redundant secret thoughts and feelings by the characters. It had no sexual tension and very little emotional angst - by the middle of the book I didn't care about either H/h and just wanted it to end.  I doubt if I will buy the other two in the series when they come out.",negative
"My nineteen year old son and husband both read this. The illustrations were fine and the quality was comparable to other DC graphic novels they have read.

They both said it was not appropriate for kids, but there is a warning for mature readers on it. Neither of them are particularly interested in reading more in the series.",positive
"This is a new author to me. I wasn't sure what to expect. While I did find it to be a bit predictable, I found it also to be engaging and entertaining. It was an easy read and would be a good beach read. Many of the chapters are pretty short, which works well for busy readers since there are many stopping points, however, I kept reading and finished it in less than 2 days. There is a lot of drama going on which reminds me of a made for TV movie. There's conflict, friendships, and even a little romance. The descriptions are well written and now I have a sudden desire to visit Sag Harbor. I am also interested in checking out other books by this author.",positive
"I love to read health books and this one on adaptogens is in that category. Unfortunately, this text is really geared to select users.<br /><br />A herb has to be considered both non-toxic and safe for extended use to be called an adaptogen. Adaptogens are used to help the body resist physical, chemical, and biological stressors and have been used for centuries in China and India.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book, I never heard of an adaptogen. Only ginseng, astragalus, licorice, and nettle were ones I heard of and sampled before. The author provides a brief summary of many others such as ashwagandha, tulsi, jiaogulan, maca, rhodiola, shatavari, etc.<br /><br />I read this from cover to cover but there is not one recipe that I am interesting in trying now. There are only four recipes that I might consider trying in the future and they are the night garden sachets for improving sleep, raspberry & rhodiola chia yogurt for improving mental focus,  or matcha & peach chia seed pudding with gynostemma also for improving mental focus. The only recipe that comes close to anything in a cookbook is the roasted sweet potatoes with rosemary but even then that requires powdered rosemary and not the fresh kind.<br /><br />In addition, these herbs are not ones that I have access to nor are they always easily attainable. However, for those who are interested in making recipes or potions with these ingredients, this book is superb in its explanation and guidance. Besides  describing each herb, there are sections for all sorts of issues like improving mood, men's and women's health, immune function, hair/skin/nails, stamina/energy, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is both a good reference source, tutorial, and recipe book on adaptogens, but it is just not for me.",positive

"This book answers many questions that vegans or vegetarians might wonder about. The questions are all over the board. In many cases, the reader will have to go to the reference material recommended in order to answer their question fully, like getting the answer to &#34;what is the nutritional content of quinoa?&#34;<br /><br />The questions run the gamut from &#34;Where can I find cruelty-free contact lens solution? to How can I meet other vegetarian and vegan parents?&#34; On the other hand, one question this book doesn't answer is &#34;how many animals are killed in processing vegetables, grain, soy, etc.?&#34; I would have loved an estimated answer for that.  Nevertheless, this book does correctly state that no one can be a pure vegan because of how animal by-products permeate everything in our society.<br /><br />In addition, I would have preferred the chapter on Vegan Concerns to be at the beginning of the book instead of the end because it explains a little about what veganism is and would set the tone for some of what is in the book. For example, on page 24, the different types of vegetarians are defined and on page 25 vegan is defined. However, the additional info on veganism from Chapter 11 (Pages 177 to 183) would have been more useful if it were included in Chapter one with the rest of the definitions.<br /><br />Overall, this text answers a lot of questions people may have about vegan and vegetarian fare but it is more of a reference. I read it from cover to cover and found it useful and somewhat interesting and partially enlightening. It's amazing how animal products can be found in almost everything in our lives, including hydraulic brake fluid. I honestly had no clue on that one. There are also a few recipes included in Chapter 5 (Pages 87 to 116). However, this won't be the only source for veganism or vegetarianism. It contains a wealth of information and points to more reference sources that can have one reading for years. Consider it a complement to a well-stock library of resources.",positive

"I have no idea why this book was so good. I could not out it down. Instead of being the typical mob romance, it featured characters that didn't fall in love until almost the end...<br />Sparrow is told she will marry Troy days before her wedding day and she does it of fear of who he is. She goes on to stand up to him, fight for what she wants and learns how to be a woman and a wife. I liked that she wasn't a pushover, she dealt with what was in front of her and didn't let it easy at her. Troy was just a man...a strong, overbearing sometimes ass. I adored them together and the chemistry was great.<br />Plenty of romance, just enough descriptive love scenes and a happily ever after. Recommended.",positive
"This is my first time reading a book by Megan Miranda. I found it to be quite the page turner! It took me a couple of chapters to get into it, but once it got going, I had difficulties putting it down. The story alternates between the present (well, 2018) and the summer before. The switch is obvious and marked, but there were a couple of times where I was confused for a few paragraphs. The book is suspenseful and has several twists. I really enjoyed it and now I want to check out some of Miranda's other titles.",positive
"I live in Georgia and found this guide book to be okay, but not comprehensive. For it's size, there's no way it could include everything, especially since it covers 3 states. The book is a good size, but the paper is thin and not very sturdy. Guidebooks used to have heavier, glossy paper, but this does not. The information it provides is good, but there's so much more that's not included in it. For example, Savannah is one of my favorite places to go and two of my favorite restaurants, both of which have been there for years, aren't mentioned. I do like the idea of having just one book if I was traveling the three state area, but if you are just going to one state, I would suggest a more comprehensive guide book.",positive

Sadly, this book and Aurora left me cold. Real Murders felt like a book for teens.

"The Agent Pendergast books are not my usual genre, but I can't help but love them! They are fast reads & full of suspense and adventure. I really liked the descriptions of the settings in this one. The primary crime/investigation was especially interesting and exciting. I was a bit surprised to see that when it was all wrapped up, there was still a quarter or more of the book left to read. My main purpose of reading is to be entertained, and I was definitely entertained with this novel. I may not have liked the additional plot that took place in the end as much as the primary plot, but it was exciting and descriptive. If I wanted something predictable and realistic, I wouldn't be reading the Pendergast novels in the first place. One of my earlier favorites was Relic and it involved a non-human creature that roamed the museum. Plus, Pendergast is by no means a predictable and realistic character! Bottom line, I was entertained & I am excited to read the next one!",positive
"John King is the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's architecture critic, and I'm a regular reader of his intelligent, insightful columns about The City's successful and not-so-successful buildings.  However, this book was a great disappointment to me.<br /><br />1. It's small:  just a little 5"" x 7"" handbook that can be tucked into a purse, a pocket, a Christmas stocking, or a tourist's bag.<br /><br />2. It's a spotty collection of mini-photo-essays of only 50 notable San Francisco structures--some obscure, some very famous.  There are two pages (two photos and one text paragraph) devoted to each structure.<br /><br />3. The book fails as a tourist's guide.  Although street addresses are given for each structure, there are no maps to show where the buildings are located within The City or relative to each other.<br /><br />4. The handbook-size format means that the photos are too small to be enjoyed as portraits of beautiful or intriguing buildings.<br /><br />In sum, this is nothing more than a by-producted collection of King's previously published newspaper feature columns, with full-color rather than black-and-white photos.  In my opinion, it is a ""non-book"", and valuable primarily as a travel souvenir.<br /><br />I would not have purchased this book, if I'd had a chance to see it first.",negative

"At first, I thought this book was an elaborate parody of right-wing cultural hysteria.  After the second chapter, I reluctantly came to the conclusion that the author was serious, seriously hysterical, that is.  What a farce!  The Critical Theory&#34; of the Frankfurt School exiles as a dominant form of cultural discourse in America!  Marcuse was washed up in 1966.  Who reads &#34;One-Dimensional Man&#34; anymore?  Walter Benjamin spawned an industry of cultural critics of TV--what a profound influence they have had on the medium!  Erich Fromm &#34;corrupted and seduced&#34; America with his salacious opus, &#34;The Art of Loving&#34;---a tract without one ounce of eroticism.  What's almost tragic is that the Frankfurt Boys (not a single woman among them) actually had some very insightful things to say about the cultural industrial complex&#34; and how it insidiously shapes consumer character.  More so every day.  Americans could still learn a thing or two from these prescient observers.  But as actual shapers of our culture?  They would be laughing hysterically at the thought if they were around today to hear it.  Get a grip, right wing paranoiacs.  America is what you have made it.",negative

My almost 5 yr old really enjoys doing it though and likes putting a sticker on each page when she finishes.",positive
"At first, I was a bit confused with the layout of this book. The book definitely lacks flow and just jumps from one idea to the next. Picking up the book to read from cover to cover, you end up scratching your head saying, ""What am I doing here. What am I even reading here.""<br /><br />Then, you decide to pick up the book for ideas, inspiration, starting points. And suddenly, it makes sense. You suddenly see the ideas flowing from the pages and you see what is being done and immediately start thinking, ""Now, where can I use this? Could this solve my problem here?""<br /><br />This book has ideas. Ideas. Ideas. Ideas. It also contains much of the practical nuts and bolts of said ideas. Use foam cubes as short term seating that can be stacked interestingly and also used to build temporary divides in the room should those be needed. Great idea. And here's how you make that happen. Brilliant!<br /><br />Now, not all of the projects or ideas are simple DIY projects. Yes, the basic gist is in the book, but there are some skills and some items I just don't have on hand to make some of these ideas a reality in my home. (AV carts, plexiglass, translucent polycarbonate, etc.) However, the book does include resources for where I can find such things. So, I'm not just left looking saying, ""Oh that's nice."" But saying, ""It may be a bit out of my comfort zone, but I could acquire these parts and make that. Maybe.""<br /><br />It is definitely more geared toward business type spaces, but you could incorporate many of these ideas anywhere. Church. Home. School. Wherever. If you've got space issues or even are just trying to think outside of the box, this book is a good place to start to get your brain churning and moving to more unconventional solutions. (Plus, the pictures are pretty inspiring.)",positive

Each chapter was pretty much like an episode of a serial cattle trail-type show, with some crazy problem to solve.  It just got exhausting.

"TRIAL ON MOUNT KOYA: A HIRO HATTORI NOVEL (A SHINOBI MYSTERY) is the sixth “Hiro Hattori” mystery, and it definitely does NOT work as a standalone.  As a first-time series reader, I initially thought that the novel was a bad translation from a Japanese original. (It isn’t--the author is a California attorney who has a degree in Asian studies from Tufts University.)<br /><br />The opening chapters have so many unfamiliar foreign words and names (e.g., nyonindo, koya, Myo-in, shinobi, ryu, Iga, and many more), and so much description of special features of Japanese mountain temple interiors and exteriors, I couldn’t find the story that was supposedly there.  The mystery of why two mismatched travellers (a Jesuit priest and a Shinobi assassin) would be traveling together to deliver some sort of life-and-death message, while carrying a cat named “Gato” (seriously!) in a wicker basket, wasn’t enough to sustain my interest.<br /><br />To further complicate matters, this is a historical mystery series--a series which attempts to “remain faithful to Shingon Buddhist architecture, doctrine, life, and practice as it existed on (Mount) Koya during the sixteenth century.”  Lacking a college degree in Asian studies, I cannot offer any opinion on how well the author has succeeded in portraying 16th century Shingon practice in Japan.",negative

"I found it strange that a book that deals so much with a funeral home and undertakers could be so enthralling! This is my first book by Sara Blaedel. It was very fast paced and I read it all over two days. The main character, Ilka, goes to the US for the reading of her late & estranged father's will. She inherits a funeral home and all the responsibilities that go with it. The descriptions of the funeral world were pretty detailed and interesting. I didn't really care for Ilka, but I found her to be an engaging character. There is a mystery of sorts that takes place. Ilka doesn't really have anything to do with the mystery or the solving of it other than working at the funeral home. A lot of the content was a bit bland, but it was well written and I kept wanting to read it anyway.  I was disappointed that everything doesn't get wrapped up in the end and instead it ends with a &#34;to be continued&#34;. Depending on how long a wait there is until the next book, I will probably read it for my much needed closure.",positive
"Received this as a gift a few years back.  Gave it a re-read recently and was once again struck by the hard times and sneaky backroom traps TJ had to deal with throughout his career heyday.  It's an amazing (and often harrowing) story, no doubt about it.  That he has survived and continues to flourish remains a kind of music business miracle of sorts.  On the downside, the book has all the earmarks of an ""as told to"" bio, rather than one written strictly in the words of the subject / author.  On the upside, it moves along briskly and displays a certain filmic quality.  Actually, this would make one heck of a cautionary tale-style rock 'n' roll musical.  Recommended not only to Tommy James fans, but to anyone interested in the inner workings of the record biz of the '50s, '60s, and '70s.  Enjoy the ride but beware the shadows!",positive

"Cool Wind's Gate by Wayne Bernard Sr.<br /><br />Many books and stories  written about the  antebellum  south and Louisiana in particular,  usually  tell one of two tales... a life of ease and prosperity  on a  grand plantation or the atrocities committed against those same men and women in bondage whose slave labor enabled the life of ease and prosperity.  Cool Wind's Gate though, while still set in pre-civil war Louisiana, gives a different accounting, a better way that could have been, one that I wished as I was reading it were true.<br /> The story of Cool Wind's Gate grew out of the belief that slavery  was wrong.  Mr.  Clem Collins of Wisteria plantation  knew that to simply liberate his slaves wasn't enough.  Without a means to care for  their families and lacking protection from the prejudices and cruelty of the outside world  it would do little good to set them free to starve or worse.  He had  a plan though, a broader vision of how a good life could be had by everyone.  A life filled with well-earned respect, dignity and love.  And Clem had Will Trahan, who would see to it that the vision of self-sufficiency and autonomy would become the reality.<br /> Cool Wind's Gate is written simply in a straightforward way.

What I will say is that this is one of those ""Oh come on, no one is going to believe that!"" kind of books. I found myself rolling my eyes, shaking my head and asking myself why I was even bothering. I got 2/3rds of the way through and realized these were moments of my life I was never going to get back. I moved on to another book.",negative
"Very basic and very shallow explanations. Content repeated several times in different chapters, and this is because there are various authors, and each of them wrote their chapter. You feel that there are no connections. I don't think that the content in this book is enough for ""Essential.""",negative
"This is a beautiful book.  It has a nice story and lovely illustrations. The story introduces the reader to Saint-Saens' Carnival of the Animals. There are spots to press that play music. Some of the buttons were a little difficult to properly press, but after a few tries, we learned the trick to it. This would make a great gift!",positive
"Intense, involving, and very personal, Patrick Callahan's Decades of Deception reads like a crisp, well-written screenplay.  I read it in one day, two sittings.  It's just that gripping.  The plot centers on a twisted bit of family history that rocks a young family man's world and follows him through his dogged journey to get to the truth of it all.  What's especially interesting is that he's just an average everyman caught up in an unusually shocking and troubling dilemma; so, although it's a strange situation, most of us can relate because of his humanity.  Recommended to fans of mystery -- real-life and fictional.  You'll also have a bit of fun casting the imaginary movie adaptation in your mind's eye.",positive
"I read this book because of some very good Amazon reviews and because it was a novel dealing with a little understood and covered area of the second world war that has always intrigued me. It explored the complex racial/colonial interface of Hong Kong and could have been a great book. Unfortunately, the character development was superficial and the writing pedestrian to the point of embarrassment. Save your time and money.",negative

"My 16 year old daughter is currently taking AP English Language. She's taking it as a full year course. The book gives you different options so if you're taking it as a full year class or just a semester, you can follow their recommended schedule. My daughter didn't get this until just recently, so she's trying to make up for lost time. The book comes with 3 written sample tests (with answers) and access to 3 more practice tests online. There's an app, too, however, my daughter doesn't have a lot of available space on her phone so she hasn't downloaded yet. The app primarily focuses on the scheduling and time management. She does plan to download it to her iPad to check it out. Although she won't be taking her test until the spring, I think this is a worthy tool for her.",positive
"I just hated it. That's about the only way to describe the experience of reading this book. I have read many books by this author that were excellent and I picked this one up, hoping for the same. This book was bad. Not just bad, but boring and bad which made it even harder to finish. I thought the first two chapters were confusing and boring and found it hard to care what was happening. I never did manage to like the characters and frankly, I stopped caring entirely about the story and kind of pushed myself to read the last half of the book. There were a lot of issues with the plot and the way the mother behaved in this story, but that has already been covered by other reviewers. I am glad I picked this book up for a few cents at a used bookstore, it wouldn't have been worth paying full price for.",negative
"I bought this book hoping for some innovative ideas on keeping myself organized.  Most of this book is the author telling stories about how much someone  using this ""system"" has improved their life.  Most of the actual useful content is about 2 pages and nothing particularly groundbreaking.  No kidding, one of the tips was to not completely write out a thought you might have, but to summarize it in as few words as possible and use an appropriate bullet to keep track of it.  Don't waste your time or money with this book.",negative
"What a turn of events in this one. While the Thorne mother is still in stasis, it is Spring Thornes and Knox Carlyle as the next team to look for an artifact that will help her. After much protest, Alister sends them to find ""Thors hammer"".

This is where things change for the Thorne and Carlyle clans. Even though the Thornes are the strongest and most powerful witches,and the Carlyles being the most powerful of warlocks, they will be put to the test!! Who will survive the torture, murder and magic? This one has some shocking moments that will leave your heart pumping fast! Just get the series lol",positive
"Okay.....I only bought the book to see what all the fuss was about.  A book about vampires?  Not my usual fare.  However I started the book and absolutely loved it.  I was on vacation and between sight-seeing, shopping etc., I finished the book in 4 days.  On the drive home every rest stop turned into a 1/2 hour reading session.  Then I went out immediately and bought book 2.  Finished that one in 2 days.  Needless to say although I didn't want to pay the hardback prices....I simply couldn't stand not having the book.  Now I anxiously await the movie.  It was just a really fun read!!<br /><br />I read for enjoyment.  And reading these books was really a joy.  I'm ready to start reading them again...but my books are currently making the rounds with other readers.  Now I know what all the fuss was about and I'm sure glad I decided to find out what it was!!!<br /><br />Enjoy!",positive
"I thought this book was horrible. If all you want to do is laugh about the problem instead of trying to correct it, then maybe this book is for you. However, I found the stories mean and not funny at all.<br /><br />The quizzes they had in there were far from helpful. I couldn't even relate to many because they reference TV shows I have never personally seen, not to mention situations that are so superficial it makes you wonder whether or not it is the mother-in-law that actually has the problem.  Some of us have to work and have children with no time to sit and watch television or worry about petty squibbles; we are trying to deal with the ""real"" family situations that allow people to rise up and create a good family environment.<br /><br />The only thing I could find in the book that made me slightly laugh were some of the quotes from famous people.  Other than that, the authors failed attempt at success makes me wonder if they do anything to try to make their mother-in-law situations any better or are just being cruel at their mother-in-law's and husband's expense.",negative
"The idea here was one I had a ton of hope for.  There is a reason that games like Stardew Valley and Rune Factory work, and that is that people love the idea of helping rebuild a small community through farming and adventure.  And so the idea that a young man winds up falling through a portal and taking over a small farm on a rock floating in the sky seemed like a tale with tons of potential.<br /><br />Sadly, the three female characters here all were the type that I hate.  They existed as tropes and were lacking in much agency.  Each one was designed as a fantasy for the author, and it was clear he was seeing himself as the main character.  Some readers will love that, but for me it ended up lacking.  I want to read about people I'd enjoy meeting and chatting with.  I actually have a hard time putting myself in the role of the main character in most tales, and this kind of harem fantasy definitely is not a genre that draws me in easily.<br /><br />This was one of the worst of the genre in my opinion.  As I said, I disliked the three female characters due to their lack of agency and personality.  But I will warn, that my opinion is based on my personal preferences.  I expect someone who likes this kind of tale will very much enjoy this book.",negative
"I didn't find any real meat here, if you know what I mean. For a book about being deeper, it was all pretty shallow and not all that helpful. I was hoping for some solid perspective shifting. Perhaps in a small group setting, the conversations this prompts could be more perspective changing and help shift that &#34;not good enough&#34; mentality, but by itself, it wasn't all that helpful. I mean, there just wasn't anything here that HELPED. Not that it was wrong or bad, it just wasn't helpful in an adult 30 something trying to find the balance between cultural pressure and real life. It was the things we say, but don't really take to heart all that much. Those things we tell tweens. &#34;It is what is inside that counts.&#34; Yeah, we all know that and have known for a long time and it doesn't HELP. I'm not saying the book is bad or wrong. It just didn't go deep enough into the subject to be of any help to me.",positive
"Okay, this book promises good stuff, but ... could it be any harder to understand? You basically need two books to interpret how to make a single pattern. Very vague. We use this book at FIDM and I think it would have been better if the two books we use were put into one. Use it if you must, because it is a good reference for children's and body suits. Also, the illustrations are better than most.",negative
"So I picked up this book because I have read Diana Palmer before, I read Lawless and I enjoyed it, so I figured I would enjoy this book as well. This almost never happens to me, but this was a book I legitimately could not finish. I had a hard time with this book right from the beginning, but in general for me I won't declare a book DNF until I make it to at least 10-20%. So I stuck it out for a while with this book, but it did not get any better for me.<br /><br />So my biggest problems with this book was basically the writing style and the way speech patterns of the characters. As for the writing style, the POV just felt weird, and stiff, like as if someone people watching was narrating what was happening, like it was kind of generic with a lot more telling then showing. And the way the characters talk was not believable. In the first chapter is basically starts with Niki, the heroine, going on a bad blind date (or at least your told she's on a bad blind date), who upon dropping her off at her father's house basically tries to rape her. And while that is horrible, it was painful to read, not just because of the subject matter but because of how it written. Ms. Palmer illustrates of vulnerable Niki is by saying, &#34;Even though she wasn't a tiny girl, she was slender, and she had no martial arts skills at all.&#34; Oh and the way the would be rapist announce his intentions was written in a speech pattern I have never heard a college student use, &#34;Girls who date me always give out.&#34; I assume she meant put out, not give out, but its just an illustration of the problem with basically ever piece of dialogue I read.<br /><br />I couldn't finish this book, I wish I could, but it was too hard for me. If you're a big fan of Diana Palmer, then I could see picking up this book, but other than that I would have to say this was a pass.",negative
"A very good, if one-sided read.  Would love to hear Jim (Roger) McGuinn's version of events.  Ms. McGuinn has triumphed over a lot of adversities, and comes across as a good and honest woman who was betrayed by her own naïve ways as well as by the rock 'n' roll lifestyle her then-husband embraced.  She found her strength though, rose above it, and raised her two sons as a single mom.  Inspirational in many ways.",positive

"having read all Heyer's and many other regency authors as escape entertainment,  i decided to try balogh. a competent writer, she unfrotunately feels the need to include bedroom scenes which to me are distasteful & unnecessary in this genre. too much romance not enough regency!  balogh does write well as far as pacing but this particular story felt hollow, lacking a real feel for the times and peopled with characters who were not quite human---if you like heyer, try sandra heath, joan smith, elisabeth kidd, carola dunn, et. al. for real regency flavor without the cheap bedroom stuff. balogh is a good enough writer not to need to do this.  this book's heroine is unattractive and not at all credible with constant description of bosom and decollete, etc...really annoying. for the prurient among readers i suppose this would suit, but for someone who is genuinely interested in the social mores, the town life, the class system, etc. of the era along with a light hearted romance - look to authors mentioned above who have a firm grasp on these background details that contribute color, immediacy, and vivid sense of place and time. joan smith's A Country Wooing was an excellent portrayal of the situation of many soldiers of napoleonic wars....estates left to be run by sisters or inept managers, trying to make the estates pay for themselves, marrying based on money so desperately needed to save the family home...another aspect to regency life along with the ton, the balls, the debutantes, etc...if reading this genre, i prefer regency romances to be steeped in correct regency detail/history and the romance to be clean. i dont understand this author's popularity - wont be reading another one by her.",negative

"This story had a promising premise and plot.  3 different Earths joined in both space and time but a canal that wraps around the one main continent much like the legendary Midgard Serpent circles the Earth in Norse Myths.<br /><br />Soem of the characters are engaging and the joint crises of global cooling and political unrest on each Earth provide a bit of a link between the three stories.<br /><br />Unfortunately, its an ambutious story that falls to its own ambition.<br /><br />Each chapter switches to a different Earth, and one of the 3 Earth's has a rather peculiar syntax and grammar that offers a rahter jarring contrast.  It's nice that L.E. tried to make each Earth distinctive, but in this case its painful to try to read.<br /><br />And the constant switching disrupts the flow of the story.  It took me far longer than normal to start to care for any charaacter because they'd be around for 3-5 pages and then gone for 8-10 or so.  The writing ends up making the characters very impersonal.  I couldn't feel close to the, and eventually ended up not caring.<br /><br />L.E. is a talented author who has written several excellent worlds with his 3 major sagas, (Imager, Recluse, Corean Chronicles), but over time I've learned to be very wary of his single book offerings.  The same complexity that spins out wonderful tales over multiple books is a major impediment to a single book and that is very evident here.<br /><br />I only recommend this story to people who can be patient with multiple perspectives and a story that will jump sub-plots with every chapter.  In a way this story had 3 seperate plots tied together by a theme, if a reader is not ready for that, they will be disappointed.",negative

"Nice idea, quite well researched though clearly mostly from shallow new-agey sources, but not well executed and the writing skills need serious work.<br />Characters are cardboard, very uneven quality of storyline development, and instead of an ending it just kind of stops.  No resolution, no real explanations.  And it's very hard to understand why, if the bad characters live so long, they are still so shallow and stupid.  Not one plausible or REAL character amongst the lot, I'm afraid.<br /><br />FAR too much detailed description of curtains and clothes, and not nearly enough indication that there is anything to the characters at all.  And good LORD, the endless dramatic pauses for lengthy explications - no one would have TIME for that much chit-chat!<br /><br />With all that explication there's next to no real enlightenment as to what the whole angel thing is really about.  And how on earth the protagonist manages to put an ancient musical instrument together in the middle of a fight on the New York subway is completely unclear!<br /><br />Basically this is a fairly promising story that needs a huge amount of work to make it as readable and enjoyable as it should have been.  You won't want to keep it, so give your library some business and borrow the thing.",negative

"This is most definitely the worst mystery novel I have ever read. The characters are not two-dimentional--but one-dimentional. You will not care about anyone. There is also too much padding of incidental material, and enough red herrings to stock a Shanghai fish market. Though the lead character is supposedly gay, there is only a token gay content. He might as well be a Buddist missionary. The hero and his lover share only a Jewish ceremonial meal, all other forms of intimacy in their relationship seems to have vanished. We read mystery novels to get pleasure in discovering who dunnit before the detectives. It is impossilbe to do this when essential information is not revealed to the reader until after the culprit is caught. I feel I have wasted my time here. With an eternity of reading ahead of you, the time would still be too short to bother with this one. Read Wharton's Ethan Frome instead.",negative

"Kimberly ""Kiki Mimi"" Kind should have it all. She's a successful attorney who is working as an Assistant District Attorney in New York City. She's got looks and she's smart, BUT she's a mess...literally. For starters, Kimberly seems to have a substance abuse problem. She drinks Jameson like she's drinking water and she's popping pain pills like they are candy. The main witness in her high profile case was murdered while she was suppose to be protecting him; her best friend/roommate is now dating her boyfriend; she ended a recent affair with her boss, the DA; she's still experiencing pain as a result of injuries she suffered in an accident with her best friend; and her antics are likely to cost her her job. And to complicate matters, she just started an affair with her complete opposite, a white tough guy named Rig ""King"" McDonnell, who may very well turn out to be someone far different than she initially thought. And woven throughout all of this is drama is her personal life (i.e., story) that involves an alcoholic father, a sex-addicted twin brother, and a crack-addicted mother. So I guess there's no wonder that she is a mess.<br /><br />Personally, I had high hopes for ""Hold Me in Contempt"". If for no other reason, I thought Wendy Williams would weave a pretty entertaining tale. Anyone who watches her day-time talk-show knows she can tell a story like no one else. HOWEVER, in my humble opinion, she fell short in this story and there really wasn't any excuse for her missing the mark. There was everything present that should have made this a riveting read: danger, suspense and sex, all peppered with a ton of secrets. But to me, none of these things came together into a cohesive and enjoyable read. And there were even portions that seemed forced. And I am not sure which was worse, the erotica, the constant urban lingo (and I really hated her nickname....Kiki MiMi) or the attempt at the end to bring some kind of closure. So read this book with no expectations and at your own risk. That way you won't be disappointed or surprised.  2 stars",negative

"This was such a fun book to read! The story is about 5 women who are in a book club together. The book covers the course of 5 months. Each month is about one of the women. The life of each woman parallels that month's book club title. The books are all popular classic titles starting with Emma by Jane Austen. Because of that, there was some predictability now and then. The actual focus on the books is fairly minute. It's more about the women and their lives. The story is fairly fast paced. The chapters aren't too long so I found it easy to get to a stopping point when needed. The characters were likeable, though I did find it hard to keep track of everyone at times. I found it enjoyable and quite entertaining.",positive

He is a best-selling mystery/thriller writer, and his rapidly advancing Alzheimer's is causing his real-life memories to merge with his fictional plots that involved brutal murders.  On his good days, Jerry &#34;remembers&#34; maybe shooting his wife, and believes himself responsible for at least one more murder that he must have committed during a blank period when he managed to wander away from his nursing home.<br /><br />The plot of TRUST NO ONE is full of twists, sort of.  The twists depend upon Jerry's memories, which shift and change as his disease progresses and regresses.  Following the plot, and trying to decipher which of Jerry's memories reflect things that really happened, and which are figments of his Alzheimer's-impaired mind, is simply too much work for me as a novel reader.  At the end of the book, I think I know who killed whom for what reason, but I'm not absolutely sure.<br /><br /> I have no idea whether this novel accurately reflects the thinking processes and feelings of a person suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease.  If it does, then those thoughts are too jumbled to interest or entertain me.  I think that TRUST NO ONE would be a much better book if the author had not tried to enter the mind of an Alzheimer's patient in order to tell the story.  As it is, the book's story takes far too many words to tell.  I rate TRUST NO ONE at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative
"So disappointed. I expected so much more than this dry, pedantic, with no suspense and the characters are like cardboard. From the first page you know who's going to kill whom and no one person in the book is likeable. This charmless piece of work is not worth the paper it's printed on or the time to read it. In my view, I would recommend mysteries by Josephine Tey, Georgette Heyer and even Agatha Christie.",negative
"Fascinating POV’s of four self-absorbed women with way to many secrets. Lauren and Jenna are sisters and very close. Lauren lives in London with her husband Ed and 16-year old daughter, Mack. Jenna lives on Martha's Vineyard with her husband Greg. They have a dysfunctional relationship with their mother,  Nancy. For me the story missed the boat by not having more Scott time and not having less Mack time. Mack lost me forever on page 104. Lauren lost me a few pages later. I thought the 3 adults were more of a hot mess than teenaged Mack. I am clearly in the minority because 95% of the readers loved it.<br /><br />I was excited to read this new to me author with an eye catching cover and a locale where I spent the summers of my childhood with my parents and 2 sisters. The London England based author has16 million copies of her books in print and is a 3-time award winner from the Romance Writers of America have received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Library Journal and Booklist.

"THE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN is an occasionally amusing, but wholly inconsequential cartoon book for adult women.  It's a riff on historical misconceptions about females, as propounded by famous men such as Darwin, Ruskin, Freud, Picasso, and Rousseau.<br /><br />The humor is marred by the hyperbole and generally bitter tone of the text.  For example:  &#34;Marie Curie is the only female scientist since women began.  Girls weren't allowed to study science because their reproductive organs made them irrational, and abstract thought doesn't get the curtains hung,  They were allowed to collect insects as you can do that in your own garden.&#34;<br /><br />For a book that takes about 20 minutes to read, it's pricey (hardcover, $12.99).  Probably quite a few feminists will find this in their Christmas stockings.  However, the reaction of this feminist to the catalog of erroneous historical assertions is: &#34;So what?  People know better now, and it's a waste of energy to harangue a bunch of dead men.&#34;<br /><br />For the above reasons, I rate THE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative
"At first glance, I thought a book about a &#34;magic pencil&#34; would be very silly and childish. I could not have been more mistaken! I began to love the character of Ava as soon as the plot reveals that she is a worry-wart that thinks &#34;what-if&#34; questions to herself constantly. I could relate so well; I did that myself in school and it's still a habit I struggle with as an adult.  I found it endearing that Ava worries about her family far more than herself. She is a book character that I would long to be friends with in real life, if only so we could reassure each other that things will turn out for the best!  The way in which the author had Ava conquer her fears was really superb; I wanted to keep cheering her on as she progressed through the obstacles ( I probably would have given out a lot quicker than Ava did!) All told, this is a wonderful book to read and it's going in my Amazon cart. I would highly recommend it, especially to all the &#34;worry-warts&#34; and &#34;what-ifers&#34; out there!",positive

"Erin has recently been released from a mental institution to attend a public school. Struggling to hold on to her sanity while trying to figure out why she is suffering from bizarre dreams about a vampire named Shevaun and her lover, Adjila. Talking various psychotic drugs to control her ""schizophrenia"", Erin struggles to decipher truth from fiction, with the help of a shape-shifting boyfriend, Sassy and shape-shifting friend, Marissa.<br /><br />While this book held a lot of potential, it fell a little flat. Some of the storylines seemed to be hurried or rushed, and then the author, Atwater-Rhodes, tried to tie it all up in a neat bow, explaining everything in the last few pages. I felt cheated and there were a few things that I would have liked to know or have explained better, like the father, the hunters, and the great ""Pandora"", to name a few. However, I will say that the character of ""Sassy"" was one that I enjoyed and would want to see more of.<br /><br />So, would reading this novel inspire me to read others by Ms. Atwater-Rhodes? No. So with that said, I give this read a 2!",negative

"Allison's sister wants to have a breast augmentation before her wedding (a surprise for her future husband). What else to do but switch lives with her twin for a few days while she recovers without her fiancé knowing? After all, Allison and Ann are identical twins, and couldn't be more different. So imagine how Allison feels when she has to leave her life as a mild mannered scientist to be her sister, a free spirited redheaded beauty. She never expected a harmless prank to lead to complications for both of them. Determined to claim the love of his life, Spencer Raft, is willing to end a long friendship with his bestfriend to have what he wants (Ann).  Confused (about what she wants) and conflicted (about ruining her sister's plans), Allison yearns  to tell Spencer the truth, that it is not Ann he has been dealing with but her sister. Finally, forced to reveal the truth, Allison can't wait to see if Spencer's truly desires her or the image she has created.<br /><br />Although there were times that the story was a little corny and dated (she's a virgin and he's a man willing to deflower her...), Thursdays Child was a quick and easy read. And while there were times that I didn't always care for Spencer's attitude, or the huge mystery behind his ""career"" (that once revealed was stupid), I didn't have to think real hard and was slightly entertained.",negative
"This is a fun throwback locked room mystery set in 1936 London.  Renowned psychiatrist Anselm Rees is found dead in his study.  The cast of characters includes his adult daughter who he trained in the field, her fiancé, the housekeeper, Detective Flint, Spector the conjurer, a variety of interesting walk-ons and Patients 1, 2 and 3, all successful in the arts.  There's an actress, a writer and a famed musician and the notes on their sessions reveal much.  Having been a fan in my earliest years of mystery ready of the classic authors to produced these confections, this had great characters and was well plotted.  A bit of magic and old fashioned police work save the day.",positive
"I think I've bought and read EVERY Scalzi title there is.  Sorry but John needs to get his mojo back.  The likable hero of this novella makes it OK.  overall, it's convoluted with too many minor characters to keep track of.  I liked Dispatcher #1.  It was a cool concept.  There's NO new sci-fi in this.  Scalzi is famous for his endings and the ending of this one has zero zing to it.  If you haven't read Scalzi before, read Old Man's War or the interdependency series.  Scalzi has been one of the most imaginative and thought provoking and entertaining authors of sci-fi.  EVER.  This novella isn't in the same ballpark.  I truly hope John can get his mojo back.",negative
"""Chicken Soup for the Jewish Soul"" is almost redundant; Jewish chicken soup was the original cure-all in the first place! This collection of 101 stories is divided into several thematic units that demonstrate the power and beauty of Judaism in the synagogue and in our daily lives. Sections include To Life, Being A Jew, On Love and Kindness, Our Common Humanity, Family, The Holocaust, Insights and Lessons, Eclectic Wisdom, and a glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish terms.<br /><br />Several well-known names are represented (Anne Frank, Kirk Douglas, Golda Meir, Mayor Ed Koch), but every story is a gem, a remembrance of a feisty bubbe, of families reunited after the war, of Nazi persecution and surviving the death camps, of Soviet repression and the dangers and joys of living in Israel. The common thread is the strength of faith and prayer in the face of adversity, and nowhere is the beauty of davening more clearly illustrated than in ""My Five-Year-Old Spiritual Teacher"" by Rabbi Devora Bartnoff. Her son Lior has Down's Syndrome, but lives for Shabbos and joining in prayer at the synagogue. ""I am in awe of such a moment of Kedusha, of pure holiness. What Lior is experiencing at that moment is a true connection with the Divine."" Rabbi Bartnoff, though weary from chemotherapy, is buoyed by Lior's absolute faith (she passed away in 1997 at the age of forty-four).<br /><br />Besides the handy Hebrew/Yiddish glossary, there are also several pages devoted to supporting Jewish causes (Hadassah, National Yiddish Book Center) and descriptions of the individual authors and their works. An uplifting collection of grace, mystery, and humor that captures the joy and mingled sadness of all things Jewish.",positive
"I picked up ""Basket Case"" after reading about it on Amazon.com and I wasn't disappointed! I finished it over the weekend and look forward to reading more of Carl Hiaasen's works.<br />""Basket Case"" combines the gritty world of rock and roll and the recording industry with a pinch of romance, whodunit and death...lots o' death. Our leading man Jack Tagger writes obituaries and is obsessed with death, going as far as memorizing what celebrities died at what age, then seeing if he will outlive them.<br />At times ""Basket Case"" requires suspension of reality, but there are many enjoyable moments (the dead lizard in the freezer being one of them) as Jack searches for the truth about the death of Jimmy Stoma, lead singer of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies. Hiaasen obviously has a handle on modern pop culture as he drops current band names and trends every few pages and doesn't miss a beat. Carl introduces us to the newsroom, ravers, Ecstasy, photo shop girls who make secret duplicates of naughty amateur photos, industry scumbags with L'Oreal hair and thug bodyguards, a Courtney Lovesque widow bent on building her career at the expense of her deceased husband.<br />The plot moves along at a steady pace, and Hiaasen includes enough twists and turns to make things interesting every few chapters. Being a musician, I enjoyed the musical descriptions and aspects of the book. Lots of memorable characters and moments.",positive
The book turns dark once more deeply into it. There are enough disturbed individuals in the world. Reading for me is an escape from the malice and crime reported each day. The beginning leads the reader into a romance novel only to turn dark and frightening toward the end. A dud for me.,negative
The book reads more like it was intended for a teen audience. Kinda silly and unnecessary shock value that really does nothing.,negative
"Before I started reading this, I read some of the other reviews for it. And to be honest, I got a little worried. However, I went ahead with the reading. I didn't stop until it was finished, later the same day. I am pleased to report that I really enjoyed it! While I didn't love it, I did like it, a lot. The story is about a young single woman. She's a programmer and works for a tech company. One day, she gets a package, which turns out to be the ashes of her dead husband. This comes as a surprised to everyone in her daily life because no one knew she had even been married. She has to revisit feelings of grief. While there was some sad situations, it isn't a sad story. It moves along pretty well. I would definitely classify this as a chick-lit rather than a romance.",positive
"Sleep Tight introduces Rose Gifford, a DC who still has a learning curve.  The only mother she ever knew was Adele, her grandmother.  Adele was a medium and seems to be haunting Rose, although Rose does not believe that kind of malarky and seems to consider her ""mother"" a charlatan who ought to leave her alone to function as a more or less normal person.  I would have liked Rose to be written with more depth and complexity, but this is the first entry in a series and I anticipate the character will be developed further.  The plot of this story is quite original.  Women who experience parasomnia, a sleep disorder that can include hallucinations and a sense of paralysis are experiencing a sense that a man who they dream of and who causes night terrors is in fact real.  As Rose and her senior partner Mack investigate, she inexplicably draws the attention of DI Money from a unit everyone things has to do with compliance. But does it?  This is a highly original police procedural, using a terrible sleep disorder as a jumping off point for some paranormal happenings.  Rose, desperate not to be different, is drawn into a new understanding of her gifts as the navigates her work in the  MET, where she gets into trouble as a newbie, partly because she inadvertently learned something about her boss, while being drawn to Mooney's unit.  I thoroughly enjoyed the solution and the paranormal aspects.",positive
"Jayne Ann Krantz's ""Copper Beach"" is a paranormal tale of a hunt for a psy-infused book. Abby Radwell has been shunned and alienated by her family for years because of her belief that she has some psychic abilities/talents. Deemed ""crazy"" and sent to live in a home for troubled teens, she had spent most of her life hiding her talents, vowing to only dealing with those referred to her as clients. So when someone starts blackmailing her she decides to hire Sam Coppersmith, a PI. Her blackmailers wants her to locate a book that can only be opened using her special ability to unlock encrypted texts/books.  Sam proves quite the partner, especially when she learns that he has just as much to lose if the book falls into the wrong hands. His goal is to locate the book (for his family), protect Abby and discovery the truth. What she wasn't prepared for or expected was the irresistible pull that she feels between them, which results in an increase or heightening in both of their powers. As the body count rises, so too does the realization that they have to learn to trust each other.<br /><br />To me, this is a typical Krantz novel. There was nothing new or original...you have some paranormal happenings, a mystical object, a dysfunctional family, a romance (love or sex at first sight), some unusual deaths (paranormally caused) and an ""ok"" mystery. For those who enjoy Krantz, they will probably enjoy it.",negative
"New knitters may enjoy making the capelets (8 designs), cowls (10 designs), and collars (7 designs) in this book.  However, to my eye, the finished accessories are not very attractive.  Most of the garments are knit from worsted, bulky, or super-bulky yarns that visually overpower the small-scale projects.  The heavy yarns also add bulk to cowls and collars that will probably be worn under winter coats.<br /><br />The capelet shown on the cover is not typical of the other capelets, which are generally shorter and quite loosely knit.  One ""lacy"" capelet is heavily adorned with ribbons at the neckline.  Many of the cowl/collar patterns are for wide garments that stand up around the neck and chin.  One sweet little ruffled cowl, knit from lighter-weight yarn, falls in soft folds around the neck, like a moebius scarf.<br /><br />As with all Lark Books, this book is attractively presented, and it is reasonably priced.  However, the patterns are not challenging.  For intermediate and advanced knitters, the patterns will be of little interest, unless the knitter needs some very quick-to-knit gifts for female friends and relatives.<br /><br />There are many excellent scarf pattern books in print, but three particularly good ones are [[ASIN:1931499543 Scarf Style: Innovative to Traditional, 31 Inspirational Styles to Knit and Crochet (Style series)]]; [[ASIN:B00114LXA0 Scarves: A Knitter's Dozen]]; and [[ASIN:0964639165 Shawls and Scarves: The Best of Knitter's Magazine (Best of Knitter's Magazine series)]].

"I can't believe it.  I loved Honeymoon, which was co-written by Howard Roughan - that had great characters, plot - everything! Of all the books, I loved that one best!  And now, You've Been Warned - the worst.  Aside from the short chapters and a few other Patterson signatures, this one doesn't even seem like it came from the same pens (computers - obviously one computer in Connecticut and one in Florida - and a LOT got lost in between).  I have to admit, I was turning the pages - it had me going there for a while, but all the super-unnatural stuff...good grief!  I am really disappointed.  I'm almost afraid to think about the next one coming out in November.  Usually, I run right out and buy the books the day they come out.  Now, you've made me cautious.  I'll read some reviews before I buy the next one.  Kristin Burns - you didn't give us enough about her to let us find some way to identify - and, Michael - not all that likable.  We kept waiting for him to drop Kristin as all married men are expected to do - and, Penley - okay, you did a job on her - we didn't like her from the beginning.  But, the premise.  You hit us with it in the last chapter - it was 350+ pages of floundering followed by being whopped on the head by a flounder on the last pages.  You know, you can get away with that if things have been building up to some giant crescendo.  No big tsunami wave here. Just still waters running too deep and altogether too fishy for me.",negative

"In Brown Sugar: Soul Food Desserts from Family and Friends, Joyce White, author of [[ASIN:0060187166 Soul Food: Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches]], turns her attention to sweet endings. Brown Sugar gathers traditional Southern comfort desserts such as lacy wafer cookies, pecan sand tarts, gingersnaps, chocolate spice cake, a fluffy coconut peach cake, pineapple iced cake, cobblers and pies (including sweet potato and spicy molasses pecan), puddings and custards, candies and homemade ice creams. In terms of repertoire, it's similar to Patty Pinner's [[ASIN:1580087981 Sweets: Soul Food Desserts & Memories]], but White includes numerous helpful hints for presentation and how-to's.<br /><br />There are no photographs, but the recipes include introductions that explain the origin of the recipes and handy sidebars. There are also numerous substitutions and variations suggested if you're looking to branch out, or perhaps to experiment with a more adventurous flavor combination (like substituting cardamom for cinnamon in a coffee cake). There's a chapter devoted to fruits, so if you're looking for a lighter finale, you'll find numerous baked fruits and compotes. These foolproof gems are a wonderful way to slow down and reconnect with a simpler time, and the delicious smells that will be coming out of your kitchen are sure to attract friends and neighbors, who might then sit down for a well-deserved chat over a slice of freshly baked cake or pie.",positive
"This is my first Shannyn Schroeder book and I really liked it. In fact, I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I don't usually like bad guy hero books, but this kept me interested from the get-go. Norah, the romantic lead in this book is a young, single woman who happens to be very pregnant. She comes back to her family home in Chicago so she can have the support of her family. She struggles with the choice of keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption. I thought her character was likeable and well written. Yes, she had made a mistake, but she was giving careful consideration to her options. And I really liked how the whole baby thing was handled. Her brothers were very over protective of her and I did get a bit tired of their alpha male brotherly attitudes and actions. Kai, the reformed bad guy was interesting and I did find myself rooting for him and Norah from early on. I loved Kai's mother and sister.

Whether you're looking for feminine florals, bold Mackintosh roses, a stunning stained glass lake landscape (the same image featured on the recent Tiffany US postage stamp), or a brilliantly blue taste of Persia, you'll find numerous project ideas here from table mats to runners, pillows, clocks, and small motifs specially designed for napkins, greeting cards, book covers, coasters, pincushions and more. There's also a handy selection of Art Nouveau decorative borders for customizing your own projects.<br /><br />The charts are in color, are very clear and it's easy to read the legends. Larger designs are presented in sections. There's also finishing instructions, and Hammet thoughtfully includes a section on basic techniques (fabrics, needles, general accessories). Many designs feature color photographs of the artwork that inspired them, and Hammet includes tidbits on various artists and on the Art Nouveau movement.

"As a kid I loved sitting around reading these, sometimes by myself tucked away in a dark, musty corner, or better yet, on Halloween with friends. OK, so the stories weren't really all that scary, but they are a lot of fun. The illustrations are morbid and occasionally gruesome, and really lend to the atmosphere of &quot;terror.&quot; There are tons of other, scarier books on the market, sure, but these are a lot of fun for parents and kids alike. No murdered cheerleaders &agrave; la R.L. Stine. Some of my favourite moments include the voice moaning out &quot;Bloody fingers....&quot; and the hippie is just, like, &quot;Get a band-aid, man!&quot; and the Viper (&quot;I'm here to vash and vipe the vindows&quot;).<br />These stories were collected from folklore and retold by Alvin Swartz. And you'll find all types of timeless, classic tales in here. Ghost stories, graverobber stories, tales of people raised by wild animals, zombie stories, humourous stories, even modern tales based on urban legends. Each book is prefaced with some history, and their are annoted sources and extensive bibliographies.<br />There are loads of creepy, morbid, and yes, scary illustrations throughout the book in ink and grey watercolour...very gravelike. Some of them still creep me out today years later. Some of them might give you nightmares and resurface in front of you when you're all alone in the dark.<br />To make a scary atmosphere try reading these on a dark, rainy, preferably stormy night by flashlight. Put on Danny Elfman's creepy, creepy soundtrack to &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; Listen for unexplained crashes, creaks, and moans in between crashes of thunder...read some more...you will end up scared in the end.",positive
"I loved Riding Lessons - couldn't put it down, etc.  So, I was really looking forward to Flying Changes - and maybe expecting too much.  A couple of things really bugged me.  As a mother of five myself, I couldn't stand the way Annemarie constantly enabled Eva to be a spoiled brat.  Near the end, when what Eva's future will be becomes an issue, Annemarie should have made her clean up her own mess with Nathalie.  There should have been some humility shown by Eva. I kept waiting for lessons learned that would make Eva a better person. I found myself feeling so strongly about this that it distracted me from the story.  And,the story felt predictable and contrived to me.  The only real grabber, in my opinion, was Annamarie's disappointing birthday. I loved the atmosphere Sara created - she's great at describing the scene and putting you there.  And I feel comfortable with her first person, present tense style.  We can feel Annemarie's worries and pain - and her observations about her own physical shortcomings - or fallings - made me smile a lot.  I love the way Sara writes and I'll be looking forward to the next book.  Let's move on from Eva, though.  I just can't imagine that she's going to become a lovable character.",negative

"I selected this novel with the hopes of being taken on a journey to a faraway place, on an adventure that would hold my interest and give me something to think about when I finished it. Unfortunately, it is a book that I have been unable to finish due to the writing style and characters I do not like. It is a good effort, and it is a fairly immersive story, but I will be blunt and say I just didn’t like it enough to finish it.<br /><br />The basic premise is a post-apocalypse world where one man with foresight has prepared an escape for himself, his family and a select group of friends and acquaintances, aboard a ship that is stocked well enough to support the relatively small group aboard. This is a similar plot to the short story “Mayflower II” by Stephen Baxter, about an escape from earth using a starship after an invasion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the The Ship does not borrow enough from Mayflower II. Some reviewers have stated that the writing is good, but I find the style to be choppy, hard to follow and very disjoint at times. Worse, I do not like the majority of the characters in this novel, who are either naive to the point of painful, arrogant or just downright obnoxious.<br /><br />I confess that I did not finish this book. I tried to like it and I tried to be objective as I read...I really, really tried.<br /><br />I like the premise of the book and think the storyline had a lot of promise. Unfortunately, I feel it was let down by uneven writing and unlikable characters. Others may like this book more than I did; this proved not to be to my tastes and based on my time with it I am slow to recommend it.",negative
"I wanted to read the book based on the description, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />It was all over the place, skipping between past and present, which is fine if it works, but in this case it doesn't. Joanne is a woman who trusts no one to the point of not listening to anyone who may or may not be giving her good advice. And why? I have no idea, since her own instincts never serve her well either.<br /><br />She's running from a storm trying to kill her, but doesn't get that its a storm she created. Everyone who tries to tell her the right thing to do, but she does the opposite to her own detriment at every turn. I just don't get this character. She made me crazy always doing things her way and the wrong way. I have no idea why this is a successful series. Because I wanted the character to be put out of her misery as much as the storm did.<br /><br />I did like the character if David. I got right away who he was in this story and why he was in her life. But there are two other men in the story that Joanne has either been in love with or has been in love with her and it dissipates the relationship with David. She like a guy going from girl to girl and liking something in each of them, but not enough to respect the fact that his presence makes it tough on them. I get that she's supposed to be tough and independent, but it makes her just as much of a user as anyone else, in my opinion.<br /><br />I didn't hate it and liked the action, although the constant car chase made me nuts. I just wanted her to get there already. But, I didn't hate it.",negative
The book itself is great but this particular version of the text is really difficult to read. The letters are really small and there isn't any space between the lines. I had to throw this book away and use a version I downloaded online.,negative
I am a chef that is always looking for plating ideas techniques and thought by the cover that it may do that.  This book has a lot of wasted space and does not provide very many things I had not seen in other cookbooks.  I would look at this in the store beofre buying it without seeing it.  Very nice idea though.,negative
"""On What Grounds"" is an entertaining mystery set in a novel location: New York City's Village Blend, a hundred-year-old coffeehouse run by Clare Cosi.<br /><br />One of Clare's employees is discovered unconscious at the bottom of a service staircase. The police are quick to write it off as an accident, but Clare's gut feeling is that someone pushed Anabelle, in part because of the mysterious location of one of the shop's trash cans. She digs deeper into possible suspects: Anabelle's fellow dancers at Studio 10, her money-grasping stepmother, and her socialite boyfriend Richard (nicknamed ""The Dick"" by Esther, Anabelle's snide roommate).<br /><br />For those of you who are addicted to Starbucks, Second Cup, Beaners, or another chain of choice, ""On What Grounds"" practically reads like coffee porn, with its sensuous descriptions of brewing (""That way the espresso oozes out of the portafilter like warm honey,"" ""next came the steamed milk, splashing into the dark liquid like a white tsunami""), bean choice (""The sensual, sweet, full-bodied aroma of the [Jamaican Blue Mountain] coffee flowed over me""), and all things coffee (choice of brewing methods, roasting, storage tips). In addition, there are several intriguing recipes, coffee and otherwise, including Cappuccino Walnut Cheesecake (made with espresso), raspberry-mocha bocci, and the wickedly decadent coffee cocktail Screaming Orgasm (Kahlua, Amaretto, vodka and heavy cream).<br /><br />The book does suffer from stilted writing and unrealistic dialogue at times, but the steamy tension between Clare and ex-hubbie Matteo (son of the Village Blend's French owner) and Detective Quinn, along with several memorable escapades to charity auctions, dance studios and New York's gay district Christopher Street, makes this a unique, decadent read that coffee lovers will drain to the very last drop.",positive
I've thoroughly enjoyed the whole Father Christmas series - terrific author and very engaging plots!,positive
I am reading this now.  It is very funny and insightful into the life of a Jewish boy growing up in very unusual circumstances.  His youthful interests were also unusual to say the least.  His complete lack of interest  and  loathing for school did not interfere with his obsession and love of  a wide range of activities.  Thank goodness he followed his heart and found his genius.,positive
"If you absolutely have to &#34;read&#34; this, based on bad-accident syndrome, for your wallet's sake pick it up at the public library.  I have seldom come across worse writing - the whole thing comes across as generated by a computer on Ativan.  ZERO character development, dismally bad &#34;plot&#34; development, huge gaping holes in what presents itself as a narrative line, and lays the trail for the inevitable book three so blatantly as to be offensive.  Ms Trussoni has some interesting ideas but no skill at all as a writer, and whoever posed as editor either for this or its predecessor needs to be sent back to school.  Not even engaging enough to be depressing, just BAD.",negative
"Although the written story has a good message, the art is biased and stereotypical. White girl showing kindness to a child of darker skin color while all the other kids make fun of the unfortunate child. Are children of color the only ones who are picked on? Likewise are all boys insensitive? The characters would be less stereotyped if they were depicted in animal or other non-human form as gender and skin color neutral.  Next time please consider the illustrations more objectively.",negative

"I read this book in about one hour. Ava, the author, published excerpts from her diary pages documenting her husband Richard's decline from both Parkison's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia. It is both a love story and sad story and a bit educational.  There is a chapter dedicated to what Richard sees as a result of his LBD. It is full of monsters and some non-sensical dialogue. There is a picture of him with Tacoma, a poodle they adopted for him and with whom he became best buddies despite his failing health. There are many chapters on the turmoil Ava faced daily.<br /><br />This book had me crying by the end. Although I already knew most of this, LBD is worse than Alzheimer's and the hallucinations, dementia, and failure of bodiy functions is heartbreaking to watch. The drug Nuplazid was a ""gift from the heavens"" for Richard in helping reduce the scariness of the hallucinations, but nothing could stop his decline as life expectancy is only 5-8 years from diagnosis.<br /><br />After reading this text, I am certain a friend of mine has both YOPD (young on-set Parkinson's disease--which he was diagnosed with) and LBD (Lewy Body Dementia) and it breaks my heart. However, after having read this, I still wanted more from this book in the sense of more detailed symptoms from when Richard first suspected something was wrong to the end of his life. I feel this story would be exceptionally helpful that way even though that is not the original intention of what is written in these pages.<br /><br />FYI, in an effort to learn all I could about PD and LBD, over the past four years I read 10 books on this subject and others with similar symptoms. Once this review posts, I will put a link to those reviews in case others are interested.",positive
"These cards may seem great at face value with its color reflective properties and all but they are really not. You cannot shuffle these like most tarot card decks. These are super delicate and almost seem like they are used for pretty show or display only. They also possess a very bad vibe & energy to them upon using them and sent them back. I even met Grace in person after the fact, and she was not a kind person at all. She is even not a part of the spiritual community. She admitted she only got into tarot cards and astrology as a bigger & better opportunity for her graphics art and app business. So there are far way better tarot card decks that you can actually shuffle and use than this one, and one with good intentions as well. This deck is just for clout and only for one person's selfish agenda.",negative
"As always Kortney nailed it with this book!! It is filled with such raw emotion, love, and laughter. At times I was crying, others I was dying laughing! I could literally picture this being a movie, it was fantastic!<br /><br />Tessa is stubborn and so sassy. She also is a daydreamer, often pulled into her own thoughts. And I am here for it! 😆 The tangents she goes on are hilarious!<br /><br />You know who is not here for it though? Luke. 😬<br /><br />“It’s Luke,” she mimics my gruff voice. “I’m grumpy and think I can treat people however I want. I like being rude.”<br /><br />Luke “in all his moody glory” is a grumpy workaholic that just needs a little sunshine ☀️ 😉<br /><br />They are such opposites but I loved seeing their bickering and getting to know each of them from different points of view.<br /><br />This book was seriously so cute and I loved everything about it.<br /><br />⚠️ Trigger Warning: This book deals with themes of infertility, but the honesty and tenderness that was taken over such a difficult topic was approached with such love and empathy.<br /><br />I was given this as a free ARC, all the opinions are my own.",positive

"The sometimes secret and shadowy world of puppy mills is exposed by this book. You will be shocked at the horrendous way that some breeders treat their dogs.  As sad as the situation was and in some cases still is, the book shows that with a lot of money, patience and care, some puppy mill dogs can be restored to reasonable health and happiness.  Some can never be restored after years of abuse and neglect.  The physical abuse is bad enough, but puppy mill dogs suffer immense emotional abuse as well.  Only through the efforts of caring people can these places be shut down.  Many have been stopped with stronger legislation and the efforts of caring people, but I think the book makes it clear that we have to be ever watchful and not do things that allow the puppy mills to flourish.  Adopt an animal from a local humane society and don't insist on a purebred.  Mixed breed dogs are often just as wonderful than full breeds.  They tend to be healthier and often have better dispositions.  The book is an easy read at just 200 pages in my advance copy.  It's a good book for high school kids who might want to get active in protecting animals.  Younger children might be able to read the book easily, but could be disturbed by the terrible treatment that is described in the book.  A must read for any adult who cares about dogs and animals.  At the end of the book is also information on how you can get involved and make a difference.  Very well written and hard to put down.  You may well read it in a single sitting.",positive

The author did a good job of creating the emotional tie needed to draw the reader into liking the main character, the emotional drama of really disliking his father..a good scheme of greed and too much greed…almost believable on so many turns of the plot.

"Going to Rome later this month and needed a guide book for my visit. I had signed up for several tours which were meeting at obscure tourist points. I had googled the internet to try to find where these places were and was only able to find one of them. I had figured that I would need to get to Rome and ask someone in the hotel (in my very broken Italian) where it was that I needed to go. In comes the Lonely Planet guide to Rome. First thing I did was go to find the locations I couldn't find anywhere else. As it turns out, the meet-up places I had been looking for were actual 'local aliases' that if you were a Rome resident you would know. The Lonely Planet guide had these listed both ways and I was not only able to read about the locales, but also locate them on the enclosed street maps. Kudos to Lonely Planet and their terrific tourist guides. I had used them before in Paris and Ireland, but never had needed them like I did this time. And forgetting all this personal information I needed, rest assured there is plenty of other tourist info like entry times and fees for tourist sites and reviews on restaurants as well. If you are going to Rome,  you need to bring this with  you!",positive

"I love food-themed mysteries and have read several series; this was the first I'd heard of Aunty Lee. Set in Singapore, Aunty Lee runs a popular restaurant that serves Peranakan food, a blend of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian dishes. As I was not previously familiar with Singaporean culture or cuisine, the author did a good job at providing enough detail that it was easy to follow along. The descriptions of food were mouthwatering, although I would have liked to see one or two recipes included in the back of the book.<br /><br />As a narrator, Aunty Lee is certainly likeable enough, a harmless-seeming elder who brought to mind a Singaporean Jessica Fletcher. Aunty Lee infiltrates a prayer group and does her own digging into a series of events leading to the deaths of a prominent lawyer and her son; their deaths are blamed on her buah keluak, a chicken dish served with nuts that if not prepared properly, can prove fatal.<br /><br />My main issue with ""Aunty Lee's Deadly Specials"" was that I had figured out the main plot twist very early into the novel, and was frustrated with how long it seemed to take Aunty Lee to catch on. However, as I enjoyed the cultural elements and descriptions of Peranakan food, I will be sure to pick up the first book in the series for comparison.<br /><br />Verdict: this is a fun beach read, but not one of the best food-themed mystery series I've read (I still stand by ""Bruno: Chief of Police"" for its wonderful descriptions of food in France's Perigord region!).",positive

"I had high hopes for this novel - rave reviews proclaiming an inability to put it down!  Unfortunately, that was not my experience - the plot was not a terribly original one, and the characters’ thoughts and actions caused a lot of belief suspension.  Of the three main characters, Daniel - the son, Cherry - the girlfriend and Laura - the mother, Daniel was the biggest puzzle of them all.<br />With Cherry very obviously (and repetitiously) bogged down in her past poverty and plan for a wealthy future;  Laura, the mother suffering in a loveless marriage, which directed her smothering instincts squarely at her one and only son;  and Daniel - are we to believe that he is so blindly in love with Cherry (hate that name) that we can’t see what’s going on around him?  And, he’s going to be a doctor?<br />I lost all interest in this novel as it plodded toward what was an inevitable end.  Seriously over-rated and hyped.  Two small a plot to write nearly 400 pages about it.",negative

"After reading so many good reviews, plus seeing that this book was on the NYT best books list for 2021 I was shocked at how bad it is. The premise is great - boys on their own on a driving adventure back in the day. Where to start? Unrealistic dialog plus the excessive repetition of names in the dialog. ""How are you Billy?"" ""I'm fine, Duchess."" ""Have you eaten dinner Billy?"" ""Yes, Duchess."" ""Are you going to California Billy?"" ""yes, Duchess, we're going to California."" Ad nauseum. Stupidity of characters.

"I am a big fan of DK books, but this is my first Smithsonian one. I love the format of DK books. They have lots of photos and short sections. They're good for those with short attention spans. I am not good at reading non-fiction books, but the DK ones are broken up into small chunks which make it easier to read. My first reaction when I opened this one was that it brought back memories of a Time Life coffee table book of the 1960's that my parents had when I was a child. I was born in the late 60's, so a lot of my knowledge on this war is owed to movies and may not be entirely accurate. This book covers a lot of information, starting in the 1950's and going into the 1970's. I personally don't believe that this one book can cover everything that happened, but it's a great start. It's a thorough overview of the war and the events leading up to it. The photographs bring the subject to life. The book is informative and engaging.",positive

My teenage daughter and I are going through a ""patch,"" and I was caught by the book's supertitle:  Notes Between a Mother and Daughter.  Be advised - that little inclusion is not an exaggeration.  The entire book is written in note form.  You're left to do the detective work in filling in the plot between the scribbles.

It goes from mammals, reptiles, and amphibians to ""creepy-crawlies"" and ""water life."" I wish they would keep the same level of technicality throughout.<br />Overall, this is a good book! It has lots of information for your little one to pour over.",positive
"I ONLY READ IT FOR THE CARTOONS is a collection of highly readable, conventional biographies of twelve cartoonists who have regularly contributed cartoons to The New Yorker magazine.  The cartoonists are Lee Lorenz, Sam Gross, Roz Chast, George Booth, Edward Koren, Charles Barsotti, Arnie Levin, Victoria Roberts, Gahan Wilson, Jack Ziegler, Zachary Kanin, and Robert Mankoff.<br /><br />As author Richard Gehr explains in the introduction on ""How to Read a New Yorker Cartoon"":  ""Most New Yorker cartoons can be enjoyed online via the Cartoon Bank.  That being the case, I asked each artist to choose a favorite or particularly representative image to represent his or her work for the magazine.  The rest consists of previously unpublished roughs, rejects, and sketchbook material I hope will illuminate the cartoonist's process.""<br /><br />Thus the reader is treated to 12 excellent New Yorker cartoons, one for each cartoonist.  In addition, there are a few more (usually 3 or 4) illustrations for each biography.  These can be photographs of the cartoonist, unpublished or unpublished cartoons, rough sketches, or similar material.<br /><br />A fun fact from the introduction is that the most widely distributed New Yorker cartoon is ""... Peter Steiner's 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer with one saying, 'On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog'. . .""  This cartoon, says Gehr, has already earned more than $100,000 in licensing and reprint fees.<br /><br />Because the book is a little sparse in cartoon illustrations, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive

"The whole premise was interesting and grabbed my attention, but so disappointing.  The book has so much of a lead in, shallow personalities of the characters and the entire story is slow and dry.  This book would do well with a Christian label - alot of insinuations and making out but its all G rated.  I don't need heavy sex in a book but this book had so much of the making out, you could skip half the book and not lose the story.  I won't be reading the rest of it.

"30 verses with a two page spread of paper for journaling to your heart's content. I love this concept. However, the single verses alone don't really leave much to contemplate. They need a bit of context. I wish they had selected slightly lengthier passages. The spine is sewn and mine is already falling apart, despite not being well used just yet. Also to note, the size is about 8.5 x 6&#34;, which made it a little wide for my personal size traveler's notebook. It makes a great month of journaling with Scripture, though. And it is pretty. There are also two blank pages at the end. The paper is soft and a little slick and it is cream colored. It is a very visually pleasing journal.",positive
"I love buying from amazon. I am usually a happy customer. I ordered this book because I love the shawshank redemption and wanted to read it again.

I should have know better but I just thought I got a nice deal. im gonna rethink my book buying.

"Schroder is told in first person as an apology of sorts, an explanation, of how a man can lie about who he is and one day be compelled to kidnap his own daughter. The narrator, Eric, has been described by many readers as unreliable, and I agree. He is, after all, a habitual liar and largely self-centered.<br />It's easy enough, though, to fall for his innocent charm. Because it does seem innocent; there doesn't seem to be any malice in any silly, foolish thing he does.<br /><br />Beyond a character study of the narrator, Schroder is also a poignant, heartbreaking look at marriage and parenthood. At what each takes from us, and what each gives to us. Although it was difficult to relate to Eric himself, I could definitely identify with the emotional landscape he travels as a spouse and parent.<br /><br />Gaige's writing is gorgeous, regularly described as lyrical, and flowing with phrases I wanted to underline. I will say that in following the narrator's eccentric mind, there are several instances of footnotes and asides, all of which I skipped. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Otherwise, Schroder is a quick read and provides a compelling dive into a character's heart and mind. I think it's greatest impact for me was how deftly it combined both the bitter and sweet, and the message that through all of life's complications, love is the surest thing we hold on to.",positive

"I was carving for a good suspense-thriller: and this novel did not disappoint at all.  The characters were well developed that you became invested in their outcome, the plot was fast, roller coaster and just the amount of suspense.  A page turner.  And when I keep putting the book down every ten minutes because I couldnt take the suspense or didn't want the book to end, then I knew i was onto a good read.<br /><br />Michael/Monroe: which ever eat you can call the main character, she is one f'ing tough dragon lady, yet the brutality was released when needed and I love the sublty in which the author didn't need to detail the violence, and left it to our imagination that the job was done.  With all the bravado of the violence, the main character had depth and empathy and was amazing human.  The plot was a kidnap, but the characters were so bought alive by the author, I was part of the ride until the last page was turned.  Look forward to the next novel.",positive
"I LOVED the previous two books in this series.  They were beautiful designed and published and great fun to complete. The third book is a disappointment.  The book is half the size of the previous books at the same price.  The topic could have been explored more.  There are fruits to paint!  Papaya, coconut, pineapple,  and figs in very simplistic shapes.  They could have at least been presented hanging on their plants or with leaves!  Where is the giraffe? I preordered this book as soon as it appeared on Amazon and was waiting with great anticipation for it to arrive.  I was surprised at the decrease in quality.  I think that Dana Fox is such a talented artist and her first too books wonderful. I had hoped for more.  For some reason, this book does not meet the standards previously presented.",negative
"It's been easily a dozen years since I last read a Xanth novel and I thought it would be fun to revisit the series again - especially with a story about a young Night Horse {shoeing} his way into a job that doesn't belong to him.<br /><br />Alas, this book just failed to live up to the joy, pun fun or even the fresh story telling of the early Xanth novels. Ghost Writer feels off to me.... The dialogue seems forced between all of the characters and honestly, the male characters resembled ill mannered, 17 year old boys without the ability to think beyond sexual gratification - as evidenced by the first &#34;dreams&#34; offered up by the Ghost Writer. Date rape....peeping tom voyeurism... not at all what I expected.<br /><br />I think I will pass on any future installments in the Xanth universe. Instead, I will cherish my memories of the first few books from my teenage years and call it a day. Sometimes it is better to let a writer ride off into the sunset.",negative

But nope! That definitely did not happen!<br />Additionally, I am forgiving of first-time published authors, however, there was so much ramble, so much unnecessary detail (and none at all where it counts) and repetition of adjectives often on the same page that I'd be hard pressed to even consider reading this author in the future.",negative
"I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella book for years. I found this to be an entertaining and engaging story. The story line is a bit familiar and predictable, but I still found it to be a page turner. Fixie, the main character, starts out as a weak, door mat kind of a person. She does find her back bone and inner strength. There are some misunderstandings, infuriating siblings, and a coffee sleeve in this romcom.",positive
"I love Kristan Higgins books and this one did not disappoint. Let me start by saying that I read for fun. I want to be entertained. I am not nit picky about the depth of characters or details about the plot. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it started out slowly. But after the first few chapters it does pick up and I had difficulties putting it down. I stayed up late just to finish it. I found the characters to be likeable. That's important to me. The chapters alternate between the two sisters' point of views. I started out liking Jenny better than Rachel, but by the end, I grew to like Rachel, too. I follow the author on FB and the book sounds just like her! Higgins is quirky and funny and so was this book. Yes, there's a little bit of language, but it's not excessive by any means. I think it just makes it more realistic. Both sisters go through some personal growth and I was happy for them both in the end. I purchased this book months ago and I am sorry that it took me so long to find the time to read it.",positive
"&quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; was penned by American author Washington Irving (&quot;Rip Van Winkle,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) during a stay at the legendary Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I bought this book after my visit to the Alhambra, and found it to be a fantastic companion to what I had seen and experienced.<br />The Alhambra (and Generalife) is a combination fort/palace/gardens dating from the 13th century, filled with fantastic Arabic architecture (ornate plasterwork, ceramic tiles, sculpted marble fountains and archways), and lots of room for imagining the days of its former greatness, which Irving brings to life most memorably. The book is illustrated with charming and detailed watercolour engravings dating from the same period when the book was written.<br />Irving seamlessly winds legend, history, and a Spanish travelogue of sorts together, and even though the book is over 170 years old, it seems as if it was written yesterday. There are tales of princes, genies, lost and found loves, enchanted treasures, battles, hellish headless horses (does the inspiration seem familiar?), and commentary on the Spanish landscape and nature of the Spaniards that he lives with. Full of bewitching music, the smell of roses and exotic perfumes, firey sunsets, and the ghosts of the past, the book is a sensory treat as well. If you plan on visiting the Alhambra, read this first--it will definitely enhance your experience. If you've already visited, this makes a priceless souvenir, bringing to life once more the stately halls and fragrant gardens.",positive

"One of the differences between THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN the film and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN the book was in the film they actually kill the virus at the end; in the book it mutates into a non-infectious form and they let it be. That decision comes back to bite them in the butt in this recent sequel to the classic novel: something dark and sinister is starting to grow in the midst of the Amazon rain forest at the equator. And nothing seems to stop its progress. Luckily Project Eternal Vigilance has never forgotten Andromeda, and when word comes, a new Project Wildfire team is assembled to investigate the Amazon growth: an Indian doctor, an African scientist, a Chinese pathologist, an American astronaut/scientist monitoring the situation from the International Space Station, and a last minute replacement, the son of one of the original Project Wildfire scientists, James Stone, son of Jeremy Stone.<br /><br />The original novel was a taut, quiet thriller taking place in a laboratory. This story is what happens when you take the original story and graft on a half-dozen other Crichton ideas, including SPHERE and JURASSIC PARK, add duplicitous military men, an Amazon native tribe, a ""space elevator,"" and a woman who has a genius mind but whose physical problems really should have a deterrent to her being assigned to the Space Station in the first place. Elements of horror films creep in everywhere, whether in the jungle, in the installation in the midst of said jungle, and up on the space station. People get swallowed up, native Amazonians get massacred, and the space station sequences have elements of ALIEN and DOCTOR WHO's ""The Ark in Space."" The result is a mess, and the only reason I kept reading was because I wanted to see what happened to James Stone. The most interesting thing in the story is the one other link it has to the original novel, which made did make me smile.",negative

"Oddly strange little book that somehow manages to be quite moving on its own terms.  As much (maybe even more) about Todd Slaughter's somewhat magical life than his Elvis connections.  He writes of his childhood and beyond in clear-eyed, just the facts, ma'am fashion, and the Elvis stories he reveals serve to bring a different, less legendary Elvis to the forefront.  This very human Elvis is much put-upon, manipulated, and taken advantage of; not just by the usual (and genuine) villain, Colonel Tom Parker, but by just about all the suits he has to deal with (from RCA, MGM, music publishers, booking agents, etc.).  At times, even his father and members of the Memphis Mafia are suspect.  All told with compassion and a genuine sense of affection by Todd Slaughter.  Truly, it's a wonder that Elvis didn't flame out even sooner, going by Slaughter's recollections.  The usual self-published boondoggles (poor editing, etc.) apply.  Still, a good read all-in-all.",positive
"I have to admit I was rather surprised at what this book ended up being.  It is a very deep existential look into dogs and where they fit into our culture.  Along the way there are a lot of interesting facts such as Trump is the only president ever to not be a dog owner, which may make him uniquely the way he is. Also, you learn how monotheism was the downfall of our esteem for dogs as godlike creatures which are now loathsomely low on the single god totem pole.  They went from revered to downtrodden.  It's a dense, almost academic book, which if you like that kind of thing, is filled with little delicious tidbits.  But if you are not into that thing I would think it would be heavy, hard reading, especially for the less academic dog lover.  It was an interesting read for sure, but I don't think it's for the mainstream masses.",positive

"One of the worst books I've ever read. I'm reading book three to see if it could possibly get worse.<br /><br />70+ years after the first Rama artifact/ship visited our solar system the planet's economy has collapsed, there's been wars, famine, quite a horrible time. The world is slowly recovering when the next Rama object is spotted. They plan for a rendezvous inside the orbit of Venus Why wait so long? Why not outside Mars or further for a longer exploration time?<br />Now I understand the world has had troubles but I cannot (I live in Florida 50 miles from Cape Canaveral) for the life of me understand how this crew was chose and assembled. Egomaniacal reporters willing to sacrifice others in the crew to get their story. They were also somehow allowed to bring practically a pharmacy's worth of drugs along with no questions asked. Fixated egotistical scientists who aren't open to new ideas (so why explore?). Religiously fanatic military commanders. Other high ranking officers with jelly for spines who allow the reporters and borderline insane scientists to take command of the mission. Recklessly dangerously activity.<br />Then there's the flashbacks, one character in particular spends chapter after chapter reliving massive and unnecessary portions of her life. She falls in a hole, it should take a page or three to describe her recovery and escape instead it takes several chapters of going back into her childhood and adolescences. It was incredibly boring. It dragged on endlessly slowly. The characters do things that make no sense (baptism? seriously?) I only finished in the hopes that Rama would win and just finish not only the people on board but the Earth herself I so despised every single person in this book.<br />The first book wasn't a swashbuckling space opera and the character development was a little flat but THEY acted like a proper crew aboard a spacecraft. It was a tale of exploration and wonder. This book was Laurel & Hardy and The Three Stooges go Spacey. Horrible, Just horrible.<br />They must have waved quite a check under Clarke's nose to get him to all Lee to do. . . this, to his creation.

"Frankly, I was disappointed with this book. I actually had to force myself to finish it, which is a very unusual situation for me. I have read every single other book about Kit several times, and enjoyed them all, mainly due to the fact that they were set in the Great Depression.  Well- written historical fiction is my favorite type of book to read. This book makes only one reference to the Depression, literally only one sentence. If I was not familiar with Kit's character already, I would not have known what the setting was, due to the lack of historical references. There is very little continuity between the events and characters in the former books and this one. Lastly, the concluding &#34;Peek Into the Past&#34; section, always present in the other Kit mystery books, has been reduced to two pages and no historical photographs. If this is what the content and format of the &#34;Beforever&#34; books is going to be like, I doubt seriously if I will buy any more.",negative

I love the idea of artificial intelligence developing and causing drama - HAL from Space Odessey and Bishop from Aliens come to mind.

"""Beast"" is an exotic, creative interpretation of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The tale begins in Persia, and our hero Prince Orasmyn has been cursed by a parsi--a fairy--for sacrificing a camel that had been defiled. Turned into a lion, he is told that his father will kill him the next day, and that the only thing that can break the curse is the love of a woman. He flees his palaces and gardens, journeying to India and eventually to France.<br />The rest of the tale follows the original fairytale closely, taking place in the French countryside, with gardens full of roses. But the thing that makes Napoli's version so different and such a delight is her ability to describe the exotic sights, sounds, colours, smells and tastes of Persia, the numerous Arabic and Farsi words sprinkled throughout the text, quotes from Sufi mystics and the Quaran, and Orasmyn's observations on the countries he travels through and life as a lion.

"Patricia Cornwell is a terrific writer, a writer who really knows how to keep the reader turning the pages.  She also knows her forensics, which is why I've always kind of liked Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta.  However, the series has always been flawed by Scarpetta's being targeted for death by whatever serial killer she is currently investigating.  In this novel, it happens again.<br /><br />In DEPRAVED HEART, Scarpetta's incredibly evil archenemy, Carrie Grethen, is texting Scarpetta videos that were recorded 17 years earlier in her niece Lucy's FBI dorm room.  The videos implicate Lucy in a gun felony crime, and Scarpetta drops everything to try to protect Lucy.  The plot describes a convoluted conspiracy that involves Scarpetta's FBI-connected husband Benton and Lucy's partner Janet, as they try to thwart Grethen's easy manipulation of government databases that threatens to convert those databases to &#34;data fiction&#34;.  (&#34;Data fiction&#34; is data that has been falsified to present an untrue pictureof whatever the data is supposed to represent.)<br /><br />Most of the plot goes on inside Scarpetta's head, as she tries to make sense of the videos and of the behavior of her close family members.  There is a lot of filler that is pure description of the details of filthy-rich Lucy's private estate and its furnishings.  At the end, everything is wrapped up in a few pages, with loose ends left dangling, and with Scarpetta meekly accepting having been lied to by many different people.<br /><br />To me, Scarpetta comes across as a whiner and a paranoid, and the fantastical plot is wholly unbelieveable.  Although DEPRAVED HEART is well-written and mildly entertaining, with the usual forensics instruction, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale&#34;).",negative

"Allright... I get it... the author has been previously established as an author of ""literature"" with all the verbose, over-wrought, self important conatations the term ""fine literature"" implies. As great as that may be in another genre, it just does not carry over well to Zombies. At least not in this case. The first time the author used the word ""interregnum"" I was dutifully impressed. Hey... it's a big word and an unusual one as far as daily use goes. But by the fourth time I saw in less than 60 pages, I was annoyed and put off. Meanwhile, the story itself was slow, slow, slow and oh did I mention...SLOW? I was hoping for a bit of brainy zombie survival and rebuilding of civilization. What I got was this lonely, self absorbed, bitter, below average main character and jerky plot movement that never flowed well at all. No explanation of when or how the plague started. Nothing about specific characters that made you want to care about them in the least.

"My copy of this guide was dated copyright 2003.  Possibly the reviewers who gave this book a 5-star were reading a revised issue, maybe 2011?  Because I cannot understand how this book got a 5-star rating.  Anyway, here is my review.  The 2003 version did not have adequate illustrations, nor story lines of USA submarines.  Nothing.  It talked about unnecessary details in obscure functional parts of one or more submarines.  No history grouping of subs was given.  Nothing into early creation, middle wartime uses, and current nuclear subs.  Just a bunch of mish mosh!  No mention about grouping a various classes of subs. So, my guess is that the author(s) thought these were &#34;trivial&#34; items to learn.  Maybe?  Uses of submarines in USA war was not clearly discussed.  Written by experts for experts?  Maybe?  I came away with the idea that I was still an idiot as to the value submarines played in USA wartime.  Oh yes, me!!  I was the idiot.  Maybe in 10 years I will understand this book.  Oh, sorry, my mistake, the title did say Idiots Guide, right?<br /><br />My suggestion --&#62; Get another book, if you can --&#62;  U.S. Submarines in World War II: An illustrated History of the Pacific.

It's paced well and I was able to read the book in just a couple of days. While I wasn't particularly happy with the ending, it was satisfying. This is the first book I have read by this author and would consider reading more by Everhart.",positive

"There are a number of good books out on the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber - for example Bill Sweetman's INSIDE THE STEALTH BOMBER and Steve Pace's B-2 SPIRIT: The Most Capable War Machine on the Planet - but Thomas Withington's book breaks new and exciting ground by focusing on the aircraft's performance in actual combat. It's one thing to be a tremendously expense Cold War relic, but it's quite another to be a liable first strike capability in today's day and age. The combination of stealth low-observability, precision strike, long range, and payload flexibility makes the B-2 Spirit the weapon of choice at the start of hostilities. The book covers three campaigns - Allied Force, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom - and describes this aircraft's remarkable performance and some of it's short comings. This is a remarkable book packed with a lot of new information, good pictures, and great airwork. It's a must read for anyone interested in America's projection of global air power.",positive
"Almost immediately something about this book struck me as &#34;off&#34;.  By page 20, I realized that I didn't just dislike the lead character, Win, I was actively repulsed by her. Everything about her is a repetitive &#34;pitiful, poor me&#34; persona and her constant inner dialogue is one of fear, worry and anxiety. It was making me question why her other friends even bothered to include her on a trip in the first place - she's such a downer, she must drive every one crazy.<br /><br />Then the other friends appeared. Pia is a basket case and supposed to be a motivator for the group, but feels more like a bully. The rest are pretty one dimensional. Meanwhile, the author has Win foreshadowing/telegraphing the rest of the book with her inner dialogue of worry over all the worst case &#34;what if&#34; scenarios.... no cell reception? Reprobate guide? Remote river location? No outdoor survival skills? Google a list of supplies to take? No one expecting her back who will notice if she's late? Check. Check. CHECK. This all happened by chapter 5.<br /><br />When I reached the first backwoods natives with these weak, whiny women and realized that I was reading a poor imitation of Deliverance, I was done.  I don't know why publishers and authors think that middle-class middle-aged women are required to be fearful, weak and must be forced to find their inner strength. Frankly, I am sick of this trend. There are too many great books out there to finish bad ones.",negative
"My first job was working in the library, so I have a fondness for books set in them. This is a quick and light read. It reminded me a lot of the plot for a chick flick.

"The book has some helpful tips, like:<br /><br />1. Other than for famous people, a memoir is more literary than historical. Expression is more important than information. Beauty more than accuracy.<br /><br />2. Memoir isn't always about the memories, but the bigger picture, like 'survival in Auschwitz.'<br /><br />3. Discovery is the thing.<br /><br />4. The things which good writers always have in common - a) writers write (most do every day) b) writers read (ditto).<br /><br />5. Add variety, make it eclectic. Look at other books' first lines.<br /><br />6. Use a map to trigger memories.<br /><br />7. Scenes are vital.  Showing more than telling. Sight, smell, touch, sound.- make a reader dream.<br /><br />8. 'Automatic writing' - like start with 'on' and just write whatever comes to mind to generate ideas, new thoughts.<br /><br />9. Write from the heart - warts and all.<br /><br />10. Characters are the soul of creative nonfiction, even for memoirs. See yourself and people as characters and life between them as drama.<br /><br />11. Read your draft out loud.<br /><br />12. Metaphor is the source of all meaning. Adds layers of meaning. Make it new, like 'business is a dance.'<br /><br />13. Adumbration -suggest what follows.<br /><br />14. Develop a rhythm.<br /><br />15. Do outlines last.<br /><br />The book is a fast read with some helpful tips.",positive
"I have read numerous other Jen Lancaster books and find them fun and funny.  I thought this was going to be a nice treat for a Friday off work, but I was wrong.  I am halfway through the book and I'm pretty bored.  I am debating on wether or not to even bother finishing it.  There is no spark, no lightness in this book.  It all feels forced and hastily written.  I have yet to laugh out loud, like I do at every other book she's written.  Mostly there's just a lot of groaning in my head over bad jokes and thinly veiled references to her own life.  Please Jen, no more fiction!",negative
"This is the most cheaply made textbook I have ever seen in my life. It is incredibly flimsy. The binding has no hope of holding up over time because the cover is just too thin for the number of pages. It has decent margins to take notes in, but the paper is so thin and glossy. The pages are difficult to read in certain lighting situations and at certain angles because of the glossiness. The book has a very strong bias— comments about a certain political figure should have definitely been excluded. Inserting political bias into a books that has nothing to do with the subject is unethical. I’m not even a supporter of the political figure in question, but I am strongly against using a psychology textbook as an outlet for the author’s personal political opinions. I also feel like the information could have been more concisely presented. I also fail to see how the price of this book is justified. Books a tenth of the price have better information in a better quality format. All of the images are in black and white. There is zero color printing inside this overpriced book.",negative

The reviews were glowing but I didn't enjoy this book. The way Jeremy Wadlington-Smythe spoke was silly and I can't imagine anyone has ever talked in such a way. There was a mystery buried in the constant discussion of how orchestras are run and why that is such a disaster. I would have preferred a mystery with more mystery and less diatribe.,negative
"What an incredible disappointment after all the hype and stellar reviews! This book is boringgggg and never manages to develop even the tiniest bit of dramatic tension. Endless pages devoted to her daily routine of drinking wine to excess, abusing prescription drugs, and her daily internet activity— an agoraphobia support website and online chess:  again and again and again. Oh, and spying on her neighbors! That’s what leads to the big conflict in the book! Honestly? The plot seemed pretty lame and completely contrived. Sure, we get the requisite false trails per genre formula, but they really are difficult to buy, and the bad guy turned out to be exactly who I thought! I’m actually kinda looking forward to seeing this as a movie after a competent writer gets in there and eliminates a solid 35%, fleshes out the characters, and introduces a heaping dose of suspense! It still won’t be anything amazing or original, but it will at least hold its own. The only real suspense in the book came from wondering whether I was going to be able to persevere to the end! Just wait for the movie!",negative

"This is realistic and sweet story about a teen relationships. My 18 year old daughter read it this summer. There were a lot of parallels to her own life as she recently broke up with her boyfriend because of the whole going to college thing and not wanting to deal with a long distance relationship. While she did like the book, she didn't love it. She said that it was hard to like the main character. She found that the book was also hard to muddle through. She is working full time and reading it was a bit of a chore at times. She's read another book by this Adi Alsaid and really liked it, but felt that this one wasn't as strong of a story. But since she did like this a little, she wanted to make sure that I gave it 4 stars.",positive

"There are three things that I disliked about THE EXTINCTION AGENDA.  First, the plot idea isn’t particularly original. Second, the viewpoint character (Mason) is not only immortal (surviving dangerous missions despite truly impossible odds), but also unlikeable (extremely self-centered and full of himself).  Third, the writing isn’t very good (wordy, rather stilted for a mystery/thriller, and filled with long passages about characters’ backgrounds, the planning of missions, and the organization of branches of government).<br /><br /> *****SPOILER ALERT: The novel is about a monstrous, evil conspiracy to thin the Earth’s population.  Powerful government insiders are preparing to release a “biological agent” that will kill all persons not deemed “essential” (e.g., first responders, key government figures, military leaders, infrastructure support persons).  The virus will operate selectively, because the “essential” people have already been immunized through secret additives to their routine annual shots (flu shots).<br /><br />Mason, of course, is destined to thwart the conspirators.  At the beginning of the story, he has no idea who or what is behind the “biological agent” that kills everyone who comes in contact with it.  But as he follows orders and carries out his missions, he gradually comes to understand what is really happening.*****END SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />You have to be a fan of government conspiracy thrillers to like this novel.  Unfortunately, I have little patience with them.",negative
"The first few pages in this book were so cute that I was certain my boys and I were on the right track to finding a decent bedtime story for them that we had not read yet. The first couple of pages had cute illustrations and the story was forming nicely. Then we made the mistake of continuing to read. Seriously? This is classed as an acceptable kids book now? The dog raids the trash, eats his owner's dinner, pukes it up all over the house and then eats the puke and then lies, allowing the owner to think it was the cat's fault. Wow. If there has ever been a poor moral lesson for children, this might be carrying the torch in the parade. I am actually rather disgusted that anyone would think this was appropriate for kinds of any age.",negative

"I have read a lot of Sophie Kinsella's books over the years. I have liked her newer books, but I loved her older ones. I love this newest title. It was very fast paced and once I found the time to actually sit down and read without distractions, I couldn't put it down. I read most of the 400+ pages in one sitting. The story is about a married couple faced with some problems with their marriage. Most of the problems revolve around the relationship becoming stagnant and boring. They decide to shake things up a bit with random surprises. I found that the whole story actually surprised me! I thought I knew what direction it was going in, but I was completely wrong. The chapters were a little long which made it difficult when I needed to find a stopping place, but that's minor. I really liked the characters, especially some of the secondary ones.

"First, let me preface this review by saying I am not a big science fiction fan.  So, if you are, you may like this book.  I found it incredibly boring and repetitive.  As with all of Stephenie Meyer's books, they have sections where you are gripped and want to find out more, but the vast majority seems to just drag on.  I think most of her books could be cut in half and make them more readable.  I liked the Twilight Series, but this one I didn't really care for at all.",negative

"I was particularly interested in reading this book because it was about Micronesia, a region I've wanted to go to all my adult life. The story was very slow getting started with LOTS of odd details. There was an underlying unrest to the book and it made me uncomfortable to read it, like I was about to find out way more than I'd choose to know about the characters. I suppose the story was written to tell about these primitive people who had never been &#34;civilized&#34; and the narrator had made this great discovery of a completely &#34;virgin&#34; culture. But the tale takes a rather perverted twist which continues throughout the second half of the book when the narrator brings the natives to live, sealed in his lab, in the USA. It all seems so unlikely and concludes recounting a grotesque and picayoun set of circumstances and seems to forget all about the niave people that were the focus of the study.<br />I have read A Little Life: A Novel, and loved the writing and the development of the characters and the delicate and exciting sense of place. The trees book lacked most of that for me. And I never did get much of a sense of Micronesia!",negative

"My son and I have been watching this diligently, and are disappointed. Either Adobe After Effects is not useful at all, or this video does not show what After Effects is really useful for. The videos seem to lack pedagogical ability. They delve into details, but a logical thread is missing. Unknown, technical terms are frequently used: &#34; Plug ins, cash into Rams, Rendering, Color Bit Depth, Bending, Gradients, Running Scripts, Rotorscoping, Interlacing, etc.&#34;  It is frustrating to not know where the narrators are going, what the point of the specific lesson might be, and finally why the finished product was worth all this work? We are still wondering why bother with After Effects. We have yet to see what worthwhile product might come out of it.<br />I find that free youtube videos, although sometimes hard to understand because of the accents, do a comparatively decent job of showing what After Effects really is for and how to use it, in laymen terms.<br />From this video, I conclude that After Effects is apparently not at all made for quality animation, but rather seems to be an incredibly complicated editing program with very limited usefulness and questionable results.",negative
"I don't know that we really needed to visit these characters again, but apparently Mr. Maupin needed to, and I'm glad he did.

Not an unpleasant experience, necessarily, actually a great deal of fun at times, occassionally bittersweet.

"This book is a must for those of us who spent our formative years in Southern California!  I was born in 1945, and spent the first 20 - 30 years of my life in and around the San Gabriel Valley, so I recognize and remember so clearly huge portions of this book.  In fact, my father was a Helmsman for a few years when I was pre-school age and I can remember when he took me along on his route now and then, and how excited I was when he let me blow that famous whistle!  I've only read the first 35 pages or so (I want to savor it, slowly!) and dozens of the pictures have brought back treasured memories; some from my childhood and many from my adult years.  The Rose Parade, Pacific Ocean Park, Lake Arrowhead Village, Chinatown, Clifton's Cafeteria, Knott's Berry Farm, and of course, Disneyland!  My family went to Disneyland the first week it opened in 1955, and I've been back a number of times, although it's changed more than I like.  Progress, I suppose, but that's another story.

"Alec Ross is right on many things especially China and it’s Belt and Road Initiative. I did become skeptical on his complaints of unions while stating that unions are important in theory. As a former teacher, he claims that teacher unions don’t provide better wages and benefits (they do but as unions get weaker, it’s harder to do), and complains that they spend more time propping up bad teachers who the system wants to fire. Unions guarantee better job safety and security. They provide a method of fairness to those accused of doing a bad job and require administration to prove it. His complaints are like hating lawyers because their clients don’t sound savory. He then says unions are important to workers’ rights.",positive

"Taken from the time-honored [[ASIN:0743246268 Joy of Cooking: 75th Anniversary Edition - 2006]], All About Vegetarian Cooking is a lovely introduction to eating vegetarian and includes an informative intro about various kinds of vegetarians (lacto, ovo, macrobiotic, vegan), the advantages of eating organic veggies, nutrition for vegetarians, serving sizes (based on the 1995 guidelines), dietary essentials, and menu planning based around a variety of ethnic favorites such as Italian, Middle Eastern, Asian, Indian, and more.<br /><br />The included recipes are fairly standard versions of those you'll find elsewhere. The bonus here is the numerous photographs of prep and informative footnotes sprinkled throughout. For example, the soups chapter starts with the basics of making homemade stock. There are numerous delicious whole-grain recipes calling for wheat/rye/spelt berries mixed into hot and cold salads, grilled veggie sandwiches with homemade focaccia and tapenade, falafel, hummus, and baba ganoush, curries and Moroccan stews, pilafs and risottos, and a chapter devoted to eggs (frittatas, souffles, timbales).<br /><br />In all honesty, I own over a dozen vegetarian cookbooks, and there's a lot of overlap with other volumes such as [[ASIN:1594862346 Mediterranean Harvest: Vegetarian Recipes from the World's Healthiest Cuisine]] and [[ASIN:1557883599 The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen]], but if you're new to vegetarian cuisine, this is a very serviceable introduction to some of the varied, tasty possibilities.",positive

"THE NINE-TAILED FOX (A SERGEANTS SUEÑO AND BASCOM NOVEL) is the 12th series novel (but my first), and it works fine as a standalone.  It’s a plainly written military police procedural set in 1970s South Korea.  Because the author was stationed in Korea for 10 years, the details of the setting ring absolutely true.  The novel includes a good portion of entertaining army humor (reminiscent of the M*A*S*H book and TV series).<br /><br />In the novel, the two military investigators (George and Ernie) are ordered to investigate the unusual disappearances of three GIs from three different bases.  They soon learn that the men were last seen in the company of an attractive, respectably attired, older woman.  Their informants whisper that the woman may be a fearsome Gumiho, a supernatural being described in Korean folklore as a nine-tailed fox that has taken the form of a siren-like woman.<br /><br />In the midst of their inquiries, George and Ernie get caught up in a dispute between a pair of feuding officers’ wives that has them removing and reinstalling a PX refrigerator in an unauthorized location, a local “women’s power” center.  As enlisted men, they have no choice but to do as they’re told, even though their investigation is of the highest priority (because the Pentagon and U.S. government is demanding answers from top brass  about the AWOL soldiers).<br /><br />Serious George and do-whatever-he-wants Ernie are delightful characters.  The novel inserts just the right amount of Korean language and background detail for verisimilitude.  The narrative flows smoothly, moves along at a steady clip, and the story is interesting enough to keep the reader reading.  The novel is well-written, and perfect for light escape reading.  I’m really happy to have discovered this enjoyable mystery/thriller series.",positive
"Elyssa East's favorite artist produced a series of paintings based on the abandoned Dogtown wilderness near Gloucester, MA. Trying to find some spiritual growth she visited the area, heard some of the typical small town New England gossip that surrounds any area that's been inhabited for hundreds of years and decided to write a book about the place.<br /><br />It feels like she started out to write a biography of the artist, Marsden Hartley, found that wouldn't make more than a short story then decided to add in the tale of a recent (1980's) murder that took place inside of the Dogtown wilderness when THAT turned out to not be enough to flesh out a book the author then dug up every and any bit of trivia, folklore, rumor and anecdote she could find no matter how distantly related to the main subject, Dogtown. As an example when a somewhat famous poet is mentioned as having spent time in the area we're also treated to the details of a school he taught at, every famous person who also taught at the school even if they had nothing to do with Dogtown. The story meanders; wandering from the past to the present while infrequently touching back on the 1980's murder story.<br /><br />There's far too much padding added to the book. I struggled for far longer than necessary for a book of this length. In the end the I found it hard to follow and just wanted it to end. I'm sure there are better histories of the Gloucester area out there and while they may not touch on or even mention Dogtown that's probably because in the grand scheme of things very little of real interest ever did happened there in it's hundreds of years of existence.",negative

This is a remarkable recreation from historical accounts and the author's speculation of what happened when the John Rutledge sank on a voyage from Liverpool to New York in February of 1856. The author creates a narrative around historical accounts he gathered during his research. He used his imagination to effectively describe what experiencing this tragedy might have been like. Thomas W. Nay was the only survivor who was rescued by the ship Germania.<br /><br />The story sets the stage with a prologue about the lives of some of the crew before the John Rutledge set sail. Some parts of this narrative were a bit mundane but the remainder of the book was mostly riveting. I was impressed with the author's ability to  weave a tale around such a horrific tragedy that was typical in those times.,positive
"Sad. NOT funny. But DESERVES four stars.  I finished it BECAUSE it was well written, but I would not have read it had I known what was coming.<br />Some of the blurbs at the beginning of One's Company called it a Black Comedy.  I did not laugh once.  In fairness, the novel is well written, hangs together, has some great characters and Bonnie Lincoln and how she proceeds when she wins a bazillion dollar lottery is amazingly wrought.  But it is a sad, introspective book about a very damaged woman who needs to live as  a character in Three's Company to survive. Bonnie is a woman in her early twenties who has only ever had exactly one friend.  Both her parents are dead and you would not call her family one that was memorable in a good way.  She's recently gone through a horrible trauma, coming out of a situation as the only survivor-- if you want to call it survival.<br />Somehow, the old sitcom, Three's Company, comforts her and she becomes obsessed.  When she wins the biggest lottery ever, Bonnie creates an alternate world for herself of the Three's Company set and sets things up so that she will live alone there and be one of the characters from the show each year, moving from apartment to apartment, but always existing in the 1970s.. We already know the concept of this novel going in.  It's in the blurbs. Personally, the best thing about the book, is what I THOUGHT it was going to be. Something light and silly and a little pathetic but in a way that doesn't make you curl up in pain.  Well done. Wish I had not read it.",positive

She is the youngest violinist there, and spends the summer practicing Mozart's fourth violin concerto. Along the way she learns a great deal about the importance of remembering, friendships, and understanding the music inside all of us.<br />""The Mozart Season"" is my favourite YA book dealing with music--Euwer Wolff fills the pages with sparkling cadenzas, trills and double stops, Miles Davis jazz records, and a midnight radio serenade. Allegra's reactions and insights into Mozart's compositions helped me to better interpret them myself.<br />There is a memorable cast of characters as well: besides Allegra there is Bro David, her older cartoonist brother, Deidre, the strange semi-famous soprano who throws up before going on stage and breaks down easily at the smallest things, Mr. Trouble, a brain-damaged man looking for his lost song, and more.<br />The book is full of detail: the smell and colour of the roses in the park, the sound of water splashing down a metal sculpture, the pianissimo notes floating softly through the air, the feel of the embroidered velvet purse that belonged to Allegra's great-grandmother, the smells from the food vendors at the concerts. This is the most descriptive (and aural) book that I have ever read; from page one you will be drawn into Allegra's ""Mozart Summer"" wishing that it would never end.",positive
"I have been wanting to read this book for years, and after reading all of the glowing reviews for it, I thought it might make for an exciting afternoon off work. I was wrong. This book has a lot of tech-jargon in it and I found that boring. I thought I would love this book because it was the story of a real storm, real lives in jeopardy and the supposedly gripping tale of six men and their journey out to sea to find their individual fortunes. What I found was a book that had some brilliant moments of literary genius, for example, when describing the storm, but unfortunately the rest of the book read like a longer article that would have been submitted to a monthly magazine for men. I didn't feel much for the characters in the book, which is sad since they were real people not fictional creations.<br /><br />I kept hoping while I was reading this book that it would become more exciting and that the human element would come more into focus. I already knew when I started this book that the boat disappeared, i felt that was a given. I wanted to know more about how...when...why things occurred and why the decisions affected those lives happened. I felt this book honestly would have been a great read if I had been looking for a book of technical fact and not a thrilling adventure, but this book did not live up to what the cover promised.",negative

"I can't say I understand all of the great reviews on this book.  Out of all the books my son has, and he has a ton, this is my least favorite.  It almost seems like the author wanted 4 lines that rhymed and it didn't matter if they went together, just rhymed.  Well if that is what you want, this is the book for you.  With so many other great baby books out there, I would recommend looking at some others over this one.  Maybe some people liked it because it really is only 8 pages (4 double sided pages) and doesn't have much text.  In fact the first two pages only say: Clap hands, stomp feet.  My son is 1 and he won't sit through a long book but this is too short and not interesting enough.<br /><br />I would recommend these books: Brown Bear and the rest of the series (my husband reads them to my son with different voices for all the animals and he loves it!), I love you through and through (my absolute favorite), Dr. Seuss' books (a few are short and are aimed at a younger audience)",negative

"Could so little be said and yet you have lived a life time after reading this slim book?  Wow, what amazing story telling, where the author kept the props very simple and everything was focused on what the woman revealed to us through her daily and repetitive routine, her conversation with her husband (who for all we know was paralysed by a flying bullet) and the background noise from the war.  very powerful portrayal of life in a war torn city, religious observations, suppression of women's rights; more importantly, the explosion of emotions, guilt of past and present actions that came pouring out of the woman in a coherent and chronological order of her life.  To do to stay alive and an ending you just could not believe: I jumped out of my skin.  Gutsy and powerful.",positive

"A very candid, frank and funny recant of a woman of cloth in what love means to her.  What I found very refreshing is that she did not begin her life journey with too much religious indoctrination: quite of the opposite.  I found the author's memoirs to be very funny and honest, and many times I caught myself laughing (with an inner relief) that I am not alone in so many of the bumps that I am facing in my life.  I have to admit, the title of the book makes so much sense once you have read the book: and it is meaningful from the perspective of the author.  Through her marriage she began her journey of understanding of ""God is love' and all the day to day life that led her to this continuous journey of learning to love, agape.  I am no a religious person, but very much spiritual, and yet I found her humorous reference to the bible and Jesus' teachings very funny, a little cynical - very refreshing none-the-less!  Through the author's life, you cant help but laugh at the very ordinary life that Jesus had, he was very human after all!<br /><br />Her recantation of her bumps, although different from my own bumps, I felt deep deep down that I was acknowledged that I understood her emotions and it was a relief to hear that life is not perfect; that it is okay to have good days and bad days.  Kate-O revealed her dirty laundry of what true life is really about: it is difficult.  I liked that honesty and she did not hide the imperfections of life and that we will get through it, one breath at a time.  Yes, the breath work came to be more real for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book: you will feel a lot of relief and that what you are going through is okay, just take it one breath at a time.",positive
"At first I did not think I would like this book because I thought it was going to be all the typical breakfast items such as oatmeal, pancakes, and eggs. However, I am pleasantly surprised. For example there is a recipe for a smoothie, zoats (zucchini oats), breakfast compote, waffles, scones, polenta, shakshuka (an Israeli breakfast dish), etc.<br /><br />I read each recipe and discovered that I would definitely make eight recipes and there were several more I would think about making. I feel if a cookbook has two excellent recipes, then it is worth keeping and worth the purchase; that is just my opinion. I decided to make the regular quinoa porridge, savory quinoa porridge (variation of the first item), and perfectly crisp bacon.<br /><br />Attached are the photos. My favorite is the savory version of the quinoa porridge. I also loved how I could make crispy bacon without frying it and with a reduced mess. I used my toaster oven instead of a regular oven. I discovered that I should only use the top rack because if I double up on the bacon (one top rack and one lower rack), then the lower rack will not crisp in time.  I also attached pictures of the two servings of bacon both as they came out of the toaster oven and after I dabbed off the grease and plated it.<br /><br />In summary, I really like this book. Not every recipe is for everyone. Also, the breakfast items included are on the hearty side--meaning they are higher clorie and leave the eater satiated and able to tackle their day on a full stomach. What I would have liked is to see more pictures. Only the chapter head has a picture and there was also one other photo. In general, I had to guess what the recipe would look like. I particularly wanted to see what the ""Beefed-Up Shakshuka"" is supposed to be like.",positive

"My daughter read Everyday last year and was excited to learn that there was a sequel to it. There is a movie of Everyday which she has not seen yet. She definitely feels that you should not read this one without reading Everyday first. This book brought some closure to the first story, but it did not answer all of her questions. It does not explain the why behind the whole body &#34;traveling&#34; which she was hoping for, but it does briefly introduce that there are others who do the same thing. The point of view switches between all of the main characters, and a few lesser characters as did the original story. It was fast paced and she was able to read the whole book within a week or so, even with her busy schedule. The book goes into more depth of some characters that were in the first book, such Nathan and Reverend Poole as well as the A & Rhiannon. She found it entertaining, but she still wants to find out the whole why pertaining to the body traveling. She found the book concept interesting, but she did like the first book a little better.",positive

"I'll admit it, I am a connoisseur of organizing books. I have many, many organizing books. This book really didn't have more than your average organizing book. It has the same basic tips and steps to organize your life. This book is geared toward re-organizing your life after change- be it the birth of a child, a divorce, a new job, a move, whatever. I think that is a great approach to organizing. We often need to stop, rethink our schedules, priorities, and homes and adjust them to fit our growing and changing lives. These transition times provide an excellent opportunity to do just that. Even if you aren't experiencing some huge life change, this book can help you get organized.<br /><br />I like the compact size of this book. It makes it easy to stuff in your bag and read while you're out and about. (That is something I do quite often.) Most organization books are a really awkward size. The pages in this book are glossy and full color, which was just weird for me in this book size. But I liked the full color photos.<br /><br />If you've got other organizing books, you probably won't find anything new here. If you're new to organizing books, this book is a good place to start. Great lists, tips, tricks, and steps to get your life organized.",positive

There are a few more characters in this book which leads you to the mystery. Lily is becoming more confident of herself and is settling in her new life.

"This was a heartwarming and tender story about two neighbors that are instantly attracted to one another, but each of them have flaws. Two beautiful flawed characters that come from very different backgrounds, but who are very much alike.<br />These characters are well developed, lovable and real, their journey and issues tugged at my heart strings and made me cry. Afraid to hurt the other because of their flaws, they try to hold back their feelings and the truth. But will they be able to truly fall in love, if they don't know everything?<br />An amazing storyline with ups and downs, that will help them grow stronger, as well as closer, helping to heal those flaws with the power of friendship, passion and love.<br />This is the first story that I have read by Alexis Morgan and it was deeply emotional, heartbreaking and Poignant. It really brought home the importance of living every moment with no regrets, loving passionately and taking the time to truly enjoy life with the ones you love.<br />I voluntarily requested an ARC through NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for a honest review.",positive

"The better written of the two battling bios, although as other reviewers have noted, marred by some sloppy editing.  Much as I've always admired Neil Young's work, I have to agree with David Browne's underlying premise that his addition to the CSN mother-ship ultimately brought the ship down.  To my ears, the first album (Crosby, Stills and Nash) was near perfection; with album number two (Deja Vu) the seeds of destruction were sown.  Stills' confidence undermined by the addition of his musical brother Young; Crosby slipping deeper and deeper into his drug-induced haze; Nash unsuccessfully taking on the role of peacemaking middle child, and Young's ego being fed even as he's selfishly using the band to jump start his own solo career.  Nash's Wasted On The Way tells the tale, truly.  So many false starts, abandoned albums, unattained dreams and lost friendships.  CSNY plays out like a Greek tragedy in modern times.  Lost boys with fatal flaws who occasionally touched greatness, then immediately threw it all away.  We should be thankful for those great moments.",positive
"Excellent book club choice as you can see by the conflicting reviews, readers either love alot or not at all. I am in the latter group. Your feelings may fall into the love it group, when I read the positive reviews it's like we were reading different books.<br /><br />That Natty, for all the positive things she does in her life, finds any reason to stay with a deadbeat drunken spouse who beats her  - enough to send her to the hospital, was a total turnoff in fiction - in reality it's bad enough. She has two children to consider, does she really want her daughter to accept this as the way things are - to continue the cycle of violence? Charlie can open doors for her. Charlie as a person just didn't ring true for me, the big decisions he made seemed  inconceivable being the person he was or the position in life he was at. As a romance it was a miss for me and as a social drama it was unbelievable to me.",negative

There is a lot of description and often there would be multiple paragraphs without any dialogue.I tend to gloss over those at times when I'm short on time, so there were some occasions when I had to go back and reread a little because I missed an important detail.

I really wanted to finish this book..and had to recheck it out of the library several times before I could finish it. Maybe the problem was that there were different authors, and not just one author with a vision. While this works with other authors, like those that collaborated on the Naked Came the Manatee novel, it didn't for these. I would recommend that if you are so moved to read it, make sure you get it from your local library.",negative

"The introduction to CHANEL’S RIVIERA: GLAMOUR, DECADENCE, AND SURVIVAL IN PEACE AND WAR, 1930-1944 states: “This book is neither a biography of Chanel nor a history of the Riviera . . . but the story of the years during which Chanel spent her summers in that part of France.”  That statement isn’t true--the book actually IS a biography of Chanel, just a biography organized around her activities and the people she interacted with during her “War years”.<br /><br />Generally I’m NOT a biography fan, and the fact that the book held my interest for a few chapters is a testament to the author’s skill at weaving factual detail into an interesting narrative.  I was struck by the number of famous artists, composers, and political figures that moved in the social circles of Chanel and her close friend Misia Sert (e.g., Huxley, Stravinsky, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, the Duke of Windsor, and many more).<br /><br />I was also struck by the enormous wealth that fashion designer Chanel accumulated from her maison de couture and from her signature fragrance, Chanel No. 5.  (Five was Chanel’s “lucky number”, and the fragrance was “No. 5” among a series presented to her by a master perfumier for her to choose from.)<br /><br />Before reading (and scanning) this book, I knew that Chanel was a Nazi collaborator during WWII; I did NOT know that she built her career through extended liasons with British, Russian, and German aristocrats.  (Chanel’s extraordinary talent as a designer, and her profound influence on the history of fashion, are indisputable.)<br /><br />However, as always happens when I try to read biography, the narrative concerning this person and that person among Chanel’s contacts began to read like endless name-dropping.  If you like biography, you can’t go wrong with this book.  But it’s a book about Chanel, her extravagant life, and the people that she knew, not a history of the years 1930-1944.",positive

There really isn't any plot to this book, just the main character, Vivian and all of her thoughts and feelings past and present. She isn't very likable, she's destructive, she's mean and yet is also narcissistic and sleeps around. The last two chapters show she may turn herself around but I never cared to begin with. Author sounds like she shares some of these thoughts her character does, or turn it around and gives some dirty jabs to white women. The problems she describes belongs to all races and for her to separate it by black and white shows a lack knowledge and empathy for anyone other than the black race. I am not interested in reading anything else that she writes.",negative

I expected a warm, lovable, curmudgeonly older lady protagonist who got her kicks doing quirky things to entertain her friends.  Wrong!  Maud is a murderer - a very clever one, but capable of destroying anyone who stands in her way.  And she always gets away with it.

"I fell madly in love with Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook albums, which led me to discover other classic standards by Kern, Porter, Gershwin, Berlin, and others, and I was looking for a relatively simple, yet soulful, piano adaptation for solo piano.<br /><br />The portfolio contains fifteen songs from the first two albums [[ASIN:B00006JL4J It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook]] and [[ASIN:B0000C9ZEX As Time Goes By...The Great American Songbook: Volume II]], including You Go To My Head, Time After Time, I'll Be Seeing You, As Time Goes By, For All We Know, and The Very Thought Of You. Note that these are the original versions of the songs, complete with intros that were not recorded by Rod and transcriptions in different keys, so if all you're familiar with are the CD versions, then this will be a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />However, it was exactly what I was looking for; I would label this as low intermediate, with a short learning curve, and the songs are gentle, slow, romantic and jazzy, the kind of background music you'd expect in a romantic restaurant. There are no flashy pyrotechnics or harsh chords, only simple, slow melodies that evoke a simpler time. This is perfect for a beginning piano student, provided that you have a bit of patience.<br /><br />Bookwise, this is bare bones, with no photos and a scant 63 pages, but if you're a fan of the Great American Songbook, this is a very doable introduction to timeless songs that our parents / grandparents grew up with.",positive

Hours are provided, but it doesn't include admission prices, which frequently change. There are some suggestions regarding hotels and dining, but not very many. There are lots of color pictures and maps. In the back of the book, there is a pullout laminated map. The size of the book is good for traveling.",positive

I thought the characters were thinly drawn - and I really couldn't get close enough to them to care much about them. And, I felt strongly  that the story took place in an entirely wrong setting.  It was like staging West Side Story in West Palm Beach.<br /><br />  Despite the above, I am a huge James Patterson fan, own all his hardcovers, and salivate when I hear a new one is coming out.  Rarely does he let me down.

"This pyschological thriller is told from the perspective of the ""crazy ex-girlfriend"". Even though you know in the beginning that she is a bit unhinged (you get that from reading the book description), there are several times when I was sympathetic and hopeful for her. I was sucked in to the story line from the beginning and couldn't put it down. It's a fast paced story that's entertaining and compelling. Overall, I liked it and would recommend it to a friend.",positive
"If the cliffhanger ending in PRODIGAL SON actually means the end of Evan Smoak, then all I can say is, “Orphan X deserved better”.  (Just like Sofia, the daughter of Evan’s half brother Andre.)  In the book, Evan learns who his mother and father were, finds and protects his previously unknown half sibling, and gets in touch with his feelings of parental love for protege Joey.<br /><br />Sadly, Greg Hurwitz doesn’t write well about emotions and feelings (e.g., love in its many forms).  Evan’s reflections on love (especially motherly love) are confused and off the mark.  They are almost always embarrassing and painful for this Orphan X fan to read.  They are out of place in Evan’s character, as molded by his mentor Jack, even though Jack wanted his assassin to remain a human being.<br /><br />The PRODIGAL SON plot includes several of the exciting action sequences that one expects from an Orphan X novel. Hurwitz does these extremely well.  The novel also introduces a terrifying new military weapon, one controlled by artificial intelligence, that this reader fervently hopes is NOT already in development.<br /><br />Orphan X fans will certainly want to read the novel, but it’s a great disappointment.  Like other reviewers, I believe that Orphan X should have stayed retired.  Love and happiness were never in the cards for Evan, and it’s too bad that author Hurwitz had to write PRODIGAL SON to figure that out.",negative

"No. There is some helpful info to be gleaned from this book, but it lacks substance. This is more of a recipe book, and one without pictures. There aren't pictures! well, maybe 3-4. Not enough to be helpful. I want to see what the recipe looks like finished, and when it comes to individual items being dehydrated--if this is meant to be a learning source-- then why does it not have pictures of what much of this is referring to. So I would say, not for newbies.<br /><br />There is a page on best/safe practices. There is about 14 pages all told on the ""101"" of dehydrating.<br /><br />Had I been in a bookstore, I would have picked this up for the title, and then would have set it right back down once I flipped through it. I dont feel better informed after having read through this. Blegh,",negative

"After becoming vegetarian in 2003, I became much more conscious about adding whole grains to my diet, to the point of replacing white flour with whole grains whenever possible. In the past, baked goods with whole wheat and other grains were easily detectable as ""health food."" However, the talented kitchen staff at King Arthur has found ways to tone down whole wheat that pass as full-flavored, healthier counterparts of traditional favorites such as scones, pie crust, croissants, and other delectable goodies.<br /><br />The book begins, appropriately enough, with breakfast (porridges, oatmeal, granolas, waffles, pancakes, French toast, muffins and scones). After a hearty foundation, quick breads, muffins, coffeecakes, biscuits and scones are explored, followed by crisps, cobblers and puddings, flatbreads and crackers, yeast breads, sourdough, cookies and bars, cakes, pie and quiche, pastry, and a guide to whole grains.<br /><br />This is my first King Arthur cookbook, and I appreciate the fact that when they discuss kinds of flour to buy, they do not endlessly promote their own brand as the only choice (in fact, there are precious few mentions of King Arthur flours).<br /><br />If I had to choose one baking book to have in my collection, it would be this one. The clear instructions and healthier updates of many classics are crowd-pleasers, and the cookbook itself is beautiful to look at. This is the perfect gift for your favorite (health-conscious) baker.",positive

Not saying much considering she is supposed to be an early childhood educator.<br /><br />I wanted like this book as there are many Sandra Brown titles that are worth reading. Maybe it was because this was a reprint from the 80's. I don't know, but this book just never made it onto my radar.

"To be fair, this was the first ""comic book"" I've read since I was a child, since long before comic books became graphic novels.  I think the old comics were better.  You could tell which frame led to which frame.  Stories were completed or at least stopped at a good place until the next issue came out.  Or maybe I've just been too long a reader to get any great thrill from looking at pictures.<br /><br />I expected anything written by Joss Whedon to be very special, like Buffy and Angel, but this was, instead, very sophmoric.  Maybe that is the function of grapnic novels, for adults with talent to have some kind of sophmoric outlet, like laser tag or paintball, like the old pulp magazines which provided light reading for people whose reading tastes were usually very serious; I'm talking Zane Grey to Proust.<br /><br />I'd like to think that any reading is of some value, but this . . . ?",negative
"Two lovers--both promising young jockeys--are murdered.  Their legs are broken, carrots are stuffed in their mouths, and a note left near their bodies, stuck to a racing form, says ""sacrificial lambs"".  A racehorse owner--wealthy, at home in his well-secured mansion--is murdered.  Something horrible has happened to his legs, a carrot is stuffed in his mouth, and a note left near his body, glued to a racing form, says ""in the mouth of madness"".  A racehorse trainer--with a reputation for unethical, win-at-all-costs methods--is murdered.  He has been tortured, a carrot is stuffed in his mouth, and an old score has apparently been settled.<br /><br />San Diego homicide detective Holly Jennings, a trained CSI and widowed mother of a 10-year-old, lands this complex case.  As she tracks the serial killer, and uncovers the facts that link the crimes, she must educate herself about the darker aspects of high-stakes horse racing and training.  Ultimately, her investigation puts her own life at terrible risk.<br /><br />In this novel, there is no shortage of interesting suspects/characters.  (Some fairly memorable ones are Sheikh Farooq, who loves the horses he owns; Elena Purdue, owner/trainer of the great filly ""Karma's Revenge""; and Jocque, the serial killer.)  The story is told from many shifting viewpoints, and there are several continuing subplots that provide continuity and ultimately connect everything together.  The surprising ending is a little far-fetched, but adequate.  Anyone who loves horses and mysteries should enjoy this book, despite the brutality of the crimes.<br /><br />What I didn't like about BLOOD AND ROSES is Holly's general vulnerability.  All the men around her want to protect her, and sometimes she really needs protecting.  My personal preference in female detectives is for those who can hold their own against both colleagues and criminals (e.g., private investigator V. I. Warshawski; jockey Nikki Latrelle) .  Because I didn't like Holly much, I rate BLOOD AND ROSES at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive
"Appealing but common scenario of a girl feeling out-of-place in her own family. Then, Zoe discovers that she has a hidden talent, and begins to feel more important. Reminded me of And This Is Laura, a Newbery Book by Ellen Conford, but I liked that book MUCH better. My overall reaction: I had to push myself to finish, for several reasons. Zoe's &#34;codes&#34; were difficult to read and I found myself skimming over them. This was a strange ability for the author to give a character who wants badly to fit in with her peers. The concept of students calling their teachers by their first names was weird, even in a private school setting. There was some character development that was attention catching, but not necessarily in a positive light. Zoe's little brother is portrayed as an extremely obnoxious child. He is cared for by a nanny, because the parents are completely wrapped up in their careers and in their own lives. I found this to be a pretty forgettable reading experience, except for my feelings of distaste.",negative
"This is the first book for this author. I think she wrote a great book with a fun storyline. This is a fast and easy read and I enjoyed the main character, Sam. She was very vulnerable in the beginning, but developed confidence in her search for the killer in the story. There are some yummy recipes at the end that are from that chapter. The only issue I had with this book was that I thought in some areas there was too much unneeded details. This is not a bad writing issue,it is just my opinion. All this said, the author did well on her first book.",positive

"I thoroughly enjoyed this fifth entry in the Henry Worth series and plan to pick it up with book 1.  Hank is the elected county sheriff in Branson County, Missouri.  We quickly learn that three new recruits have been trained and are starting work in the wake of several employee terminations.  The department is deeply divided over a budgetary decision to allow no overtime, in order to maintain a full staff.  Hank's wife, Maggie is the ER doctor in town.  She has noticed that an unusually large number of older bus tourists have ended up in the hospital with dehydration and low blood sugar issues while attending some of the entertainment venues. Hank agrees to take a look at the issue.  Booth does a nice job weaving in department politics, the advancement and performance of various less experienced people and the new recruits, the Chief Deputy Sheriff's efforts to quietly keep a handle on how bad the remaining angry employees are making things for the newbies or less experienced folks, and in general, a character named Earl who is a civilian clerk with more common sense in his pinkie than most of the folks around him.  There is a murder, the victim not quite likable so we have a number of good suspects.  There is a bigwig that Hank has never cared for who he is sure is involved somehow.  There are the County Commissioners, with one anti-sheriff bozo and others not willing to adequately fund the department.  All in all it's a great cast of characters with some very original plot twists and some lessons on effective community policing and doing the right thing.  I was sleepy when I started the book.  Booth starts many sections of the book without identifying the character who we are reading about.  I had to go back and pick up her style but it was a very enjoyable technique once I read the whole book wide awake.",positive
"This is a really short book. I honestly didn't expect to like the book. I thought I would have issues with the premise. However, I found that I largely agree with Mr. Houghton.<br />There were so many areas where I wanted him to go on and build the thought/argument a bit more. Like the history of contraception and the church- that could definitely have been expounded on.<br />I would have also liked to have seen this co-written with his wife. Namely because she would bring a slightly different perspective to the plate. As the father and the breadwinner in his family, he can share his stresses and struggles about providing for a larger family. Where she could have given a perspective more on the day to day juggling of a large family. It would have just been neat to see a fuller picture. Though I am glad that we got his side since it was just one side, since most large family books I have read have been from the mother's perspective.<br />I disagreed with him on a few points. Namely that the Christian acceptance of evolution has brought us to the place where the church and the culture have the same views. I think individualism and consumerism are more to blame. I also disagree his rant about modern psychology, but that would be an argument for another time. Either way, the arguments are definitely points to think about, and something to get discussion going, which is worth something on its own, even if I disagree with his conclusions.<br />Overall, a good book that I do recommend on the subject of contraception for Christian families. It gets the conversation started.",positive
I was having a hard time getting the big book version of this book so was happy to buy it. However:<br />1) this is a school copy so should not be sold.

They also don't have any of the fun drinks people are ordering now a days, sour patch kids, payday bar, birthday cake. This is a book for the rich and the &#34;traditional&#34; in pallet.

"THE WALLS is a rather slow-moving novel about a severely abused wife's inner turmoil regarding staying with her husband (if she leaves, will he carry out his threats to her teenage son and elderly father?), and plotting her ultimate escape (can she use her prison-insider knowledge to plot a murder, and get away with it?).<br /><br />The “perfect crime” she envisions is mundane, with an imperfect alibi (watching a movie by herself?).  The crime also takes a decidedly back seat to her constant thoughts about protecting the two close family members who mean the world to her.  They, of course, think the husband is a terrific guy, and are unaware of the abuse.<br /><br />As a mystery/thriller, the novel falls short.  However, it seems accurate enough in portraying a woman who is trapped in an abusive marriage.  It isn't always so easy for a woman to call the cops on a husband, or simply to divorce him.  In my opinion, the value of this novel lies in its food for thought:  Does the abuse inflicted on the heroine by her controlling, abusive husband justify the heroine's choice of escape route?  Could she have done anything else?  Should she be forgiven?<br /><br />I ordered this book as a mystery/thriller, and was disappointed when (1) it turned out to be women's literary fiction, not general escape fiction; and (2) the prison setting seemed incidental to the overall plot.",negative

(7 year old girl, 5 year old boy, 3 year old boy, 2 year old boy) The other princesses were quite mean to Princess Peepers and Princess Peepers was a bit overly critical in her search for a suitable pet, but the kids enjoyed the adventure.

What do you think unicorns smell like?) It wasn't a prize winning read, but certainly delightful and enjoyable.",positive

"Time is finite and by squandering it, we destroy the present and rob our future. For example, if we waste time on tasks or experiences or friends that are not important, we could have reallocated it to spending time with our spouse, on self-improvement, or excercising which may be more important and might enhance our future (or increase life expectancy as excerising might do).<br /><br />The author examines many ways in which we could waste time and makes a compelling case as to why it is important to constantly re-evaluate where we put our effort by asking outselves powerful questions (PQs).<br /><br />The messages within is excellent except for the  vulnerabilities assessment (starting on Page 151). Most of the questions did not apply to me, so I answered them as if they did apply to me. For instance, the questions assume you have a spouse and children.  I believe they need to be redesigned to accommodate everyone. My score blantly missed two truths about me and it is possible the wording and the fact that many situations are not taken into consideration, caused it to be skewed.<br /><br />In summary this is a wonderful book. It would have received 5 stars from me, if it were not for the vulnerabilities assessment that I feel needs improvement.",positive

"After longing for ""Mary Engelbreit Cross Stitch for All Seasons,"" but balking at the high price, I eventually picked up a copy for a song in a bargain bin.  I am a longtime fan of Mary Engelbreit's whimsical work, and copies of several of her more famous works (Everyone needs their own Spot, It's Good to be Queen) grace my home.<br /><br />""Cross Stitch For All Seasons"" includes cross stitch adaptations of Engelbreit's signature works such as Everyone Needs Their Own Spot, Believe, and It's Good to be Queen in a variety of uses: as pillows, basket liners, placemats, bookends, button covers, treat bags and more.<br /><br />The book is arranged in four seasons (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer), and projects are grouped accordingly.  Halloween treats include a centerpiece, treat bag, candy corn button covers, basket liners and more.  Spring features handy gifts for the gardener.  Baby and wedding projects are also included, along with ""Breit ideas"" and a handy section on cross-stitch basics.<br /><br />The patterns are easy to read, both in the choice of colors and in the size of the patterns themselves.  I would classify the stitching level as moderately difficult, and based on the numerous color photos of finished projects that grace the book, the patterns are very close to the originals.  Ranging from quick and easy (button covers) to down and dirty (double-layered, matted wedding plaques), this is sure to please any cross-stitcher who loves the timeless art of Mary Engelbreit.",positive

I was confused a little bit in the other one that I read, but the main characters in this are not Kowalskis, so I found it not a problem in this one. I really liked this book a lot. It's definitely a formula romance, but there are a lot of fresh and new elements to it that I didn't feel like it's something I've already read. I also appreciated that there wasn't a huge dramatic misunderstanding or event that separated the two love interests. I found that to be more true to life.

"I'm so disappointed in this book. I thought it would make a great gift for another dog lover friend of mine, one who is always sending me cute dog cartoons. But I thought I would pick up a used copy for myself first so I could actually read them. Perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough for the New Yorker brand of humor. Most of the cartoons contained in this book do not resonate with me at all.  Perhaps I'm exceptionally slow, but some I don't even understand. I find very few of them at all funny. Some, seem to me, to be at the expense of dogs. I doubt if most of these are actually written and drawn by dog lovers; it feels more like insensitive people trying to appear witty. There is a fairly large variety in this book, so you might find something that you like. I found a couple. But overall, I found this collection extremely disappointing. I will not buy another copy for my friend, and do not recommend it. I was going to purchase the New Yorker book of cat cartoons, but am now rethinking that. Thumbs down on this book!",negative

"Do yourself a favor and borrow this from the library rather than wasting money on it.<br />The quality of writing has deteriorated very badly - partly the constant interpolations of back-story stuff so that people who haven't read the other two books can be catered to, plus the completely idiotic resuscitation of several characters from the past that have no worthwhile part to play in the current story.  Also the illogical &#34;plot structure&#34; that has several key characters doing things that are just plain stupid simply to push them into the next quirk in the unreasonable plot<br /><br />But worst of all is the descent into prurient gratuitous violence.  The prolonged descriptions of torture are stomach churning and disgusting, and the seemingly random attacks of one character upon another make the whole &#34;creature&#34; population seem composed of junk yard dogs.<br /><br />The story moves with the pace and coherence of an aging cable car with bad brakes - jerky, stop and start, spurts of pseudo-action, then digressions.  The dialogue voices are stilted and make essentially no distinction between one character and another.<br /><br />The whole thing is banal, ugly and gratuitous enough that I'm sure Ms Harkness will make a ton of money off of it, and the supposed push to turn this whole thing into a series of movies will be made easier by the comic strip quality of this current volume.  Sadly, what started in the first volume as a fairly well written story with characters that seemed worth developing has deteriorated into something that moves between mediocrity and toxicity.  There is no magic here, and that becomes most apparent in the scenes where magic is supposed to be taking place.  Ms Harkness clearly does not &#34;get it&#34; about the nature of the magical world.",negative

Interminable. I kept pushing through but it wasn't a compelling read. I have two other titles by this author and now I feel I should drop them off at Goodwill.<br /><br />A far cry from the Lou Boldt detective novels set in Seattle - try them and you will see good writing.,negative
"I made it through three-quarters of this book before I finally had to give up. My honest opinion is that this work is by a brilliant man, but this is not always the most brilliant of works. There is a tremendous amount of useless exposition in this book, the author repeats himself in his invented terminology over and again and at times his writing style is so obscure and difficult to make heads or tails of that you lose the original concept he was trying to promote after a few pages. I finally gave up. This book says everything it needs to say within the first few chapters and after that, there really is no further point.",negative
"This is a comprehensive guidebook on Italy. It is full of color pictures and photos. It gives a couple of itineraries depending on the length of your trip.

There are lots of maps inside, but it does not include any pullout ones. It's a good size for traveling.",positive

"I wanted a cookbook that I could sit with my 4 1/2 year old and 7 year old grandsons and choose things to make...  There are several things I think will tempt them... I want to encourage my boys to try new things and have a part in the process of the cooking.  This book has wonderful full color photos on most of the book.  You ""eat"" with your eyes first... this is important - especially when trying to get kids involved.  I will update my review as we have tried a few things.  Why not 5 stars.... a hard spine... not a spiral  - which makes it easier to keep open...  *meh*... I do like the healthier recipes.  I didn't see anything that you needed a degree to get done - which is good cause we are trying to get kids involved here!  There are easy to follow step by step directions.  The 7 year old reads so he is going to jump on the details.  The 4 1/2 year old will like the photos.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful... and I do hope this info was helpful to you in some way!",positive
"As an adult, I like this book. This book is really more of a picture book for adults. Sure, the kids sort of got it, but the given situations were adult situations. Mister Yes cannot say no and then hates himself for it. He accidentally says no one day, likes how it feels, and continues to say no when he wants to. A great lesson. But this doesn’t seem to speak to kids.<br />The pictures are amazing and the stone paper feels really nice in hand. I really like that aspect of the book. The look and feel is outstanding.",positive

"This book took a lot of patience to complete, and I still can't believe I read the whole thing.<br /><br />Stuck in midstream without a paddle, it floats between romance, mystery, mayhem and madness. Evanovich's usually quirky characters fly off the believability radar like stealth bombers, unfortunately undetected by my bad book warning system.<br /><br />What starts out as a rich man, divorced woman love story in a horsey setting, becomes a comedy circus of professional wrestlers, crazy people, insects and endless (and I mean ENDLESS) repetition.<br /><br />Evanovich and Hughes seem to have forgotten the KISS principle for effective writing, and I would recommend you forget this one.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 26, 2005<br /><br />(KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid)",negative
"RATTLE is among the most pointless and depressing mystery/thriller/suspense novels that I’ve ever read.  The killer, a hospital worker, is a collector of human bones and skeletons that exhibit rare deformities (particularly fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva).  He takes special delight in dissecting his specimens, and has difficulty deciding whether “to keep or to kill” the living children he kidnaps for his collection because the children have obvious bone disease.<br /><br />The story is told from multiple viewpoints (the children, their parents, the detective investigating the case, the killer), and focuses on all of their dysfunctional family relationships.  There’s a story there, but it’s so dark and fantastical, one wonders why anyone felt that it needed to be told.<br /><br />The writing isn’t anything to shout about.  The clumsy attempts at foreshadowing only make the plot hard to follow.  The plot itself relies heavily on coincidences to move it forward, and many plot events appear to be inserted just to fill out the word count.  The story has some shock value, but that by itself isn’t enough.  For light reading, I enjoy most fantasy, mystery/thriller, and suspense novels, but this novel is one that I wouldn’t recommend even for summer beach reading.",negative
"The author is an army linguist who was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In this text, she elaborates on what got her there, her rape, how it was handled, and what it was like to be a woman in a man's world. In one sense, she had to become more masculine during the war by evolving into someone she did not recognize. <br /><br />Those who have been traumatized via violence, whether it be rape or war, will most likely be able to relate to this story and the turmoil it brings to one's life. Those who never have received justice when justice was due may also relate.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the book I did not want to put down but the last third takes the reader on a wild trip of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) that made me feel like I caught a case of it. The author is a gifted writer and draws the reader into the story for most of this book with the exception of the last several chapters.",positive
"If you hold a very casual interest in self-publishing, you might enjoy the book.  However, if you have a serious interest and/or need information about self-publishing for yourself, save your money and move on.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this book was recommended, it is superfluous at best.  I am actually fairly disappointed in it thus far.  It's not the writing, that's fine, it's the lack of writing.  The author has crammed as many pictures in it as possible and opted for very thick pages to make the book seem more in-depth and gratuitous than it is in actuality.  It's like one could have spent a week googling all the information and written this thing, I don't get a feeling this person knows more than what they are explaining in the pages, and even those explanations are more a summary of real information which is not included.",negative

"I really liked ""The Historian"" and approached this book with enthusiasm, to be deeply disappointed.  The story is lackluster and essentially pointless, and worst of all the 3 supposedly different voices that tell what passes for a story are completey indistinguishable. It's a trivial, insignificant project best suited as a stand-in for Ambien (unless, of course, you're a painter, in which case PERHAPS the endless navel-gazing about painterly suffering might possibly be of interest to you).<br />If you HAVE to read it, borrow it from the library, don't waste money buying the thing.  It's just not worth it.",negative
"I have seen several of Barry Sonnenfeld's movies over the years and have enjoyed them. After reading the promo for this autobiography, I was intrigued and interested in reading it. It's a pretty easy read and very entertaining. I found some of it to be a bit choppy at times, but that may have been due to it being an advanced copy. Sonnenfeld is at least ten years older than me, but I found a lot of his upbringing to be something I could relate with. There were some disturbing parts, but overall it was a good read.",positive

"This book is nothing more than poorly disguised leftist drivel that selectively and loosely attempts to validate itself by interjecting Christianity-like components into its “story” without any regard for actual Scripture. The kidnapping of the MC’s 6 year old daughter leads to his personal rendezvous with Papa/God (gag) at the Shack where the girl’s bloody dress was discovered 3 years earlier. Clearly all the rest of us who have suffered losses and horrible tragedies just aren’t tight enough with “Papa” to warrant personal notes and visits to answer our questions and soothe our aching hearts! I can understand the anguish and heartache all too well! My 5 year old son was mowed down in front of our home by a drunk driver, my 17 year old daughter was shot point blank in the head by a jealous ex-boyfriend, and both of my premature twins died after short lives filled with overwhelming disabilities related to their prematurity—and that ain’t fiction. Clearly I must be doing something wrong, since Papa has yet to stick a note in my mailbox! How insulting and offensive to anyone who has actually endured any tragic loss! I won’t even get into the plug for Bill Moyer as an honest journalist, Papa headlining as a black female—nods to rascism and sexism themes, and the anti-gun agenda as indicated by Papa’s icky 2-fingered grip to secure the bad gun so no one gets hurt! Frankly, if I ever see someone handling a loaded firearm with two fingers I am going to be scared THEY are going to be the ones most likely to hurt me! And all this was by Chapter Five! I’m sure Chapter Six introduced a sympathetic same sex couple and some honorable illegal immigrants for the sake of social justice—but I had to quit reading to go rinse the throw up out of my mouth. Purely disgusting and offensive!",negative
"I wasn't sure what this short story was going to be about, other than something to do with cats and Christmas. I have not read any other books about Homer, but I am a huge fan of cats!

"A YEAR IN THE GARDEN:  365 INSPIRATIONAL GARDENS AND GARDENING TIPS is a gardener’s perpetual daily calendar (months and dates only, no days of the weeks or years) with beautiful full-color garden photos.  It’s very heavy (4 lbs. 8.8 oz.) for such a small hardcover book (8” x 8”), and somewhat clumsy to handle.<br /><br />Gardening enthusiasts will enjoy reading the “tips”, which are actually short, opinionated essays about garden topics rather than serious how-to advice.  For example, the June 1 entry says, in part:  “Rose archways not only provide support for the plants but are also eye-catching and can be used to partition space, if they’re the appropriate size, material and style for the garden. ...Choose as wide an arch as possible.  Roses bloom more abundantly when their tendrils are not vertical but are guided horizontally in gentle spirals. …”<br /><br />The accompanying photo for June 1 shows a lovely archway of light and dark pink roses that frames a rustic woven willow bench.  The pages all have some space allotted for the owner’s “Notes/Birthdays”.  The book also has a Table of Contents (in back) that identifies the subjects of the daily essays by date, so that the owner can use the book as a reference.",positive

There is a pseodo-soapbox feel to this book.<br /><br />I still think Believe is worth reading, and I love that NPR invites anyone to submit their own essay.",negative
"It is 1947. Billie Walker, private enquiry agent, working in Sydney Australia, has become rather notorious after a Nazi war criminal died in a fall from her office balcony at the end of her last major case.  Now, Vera Montgomery, a wealthy client wants to find her husband Robert who disappeared, possibly in France, in 1945.  Billie is ambivalent about the need to travel to Paris, which is filled with memories of her husband, last seen in Warsaw during a violent time near the end of the war.  She wonders if she will be able to get more information about what happened to him.  It has been three years since she last heard from him.  She assumes he is dead.<br /><br />The Ghosts of Paris is a nicely crafted detective story, with most of the action taking place in postwar London and Paris.  Billie and her hunky assistant Sam travel together to seek out Montgomery and confirm his death or secure a divorce and financial settlement for his wife.  Along the way, they run into far more excitement then they bargained for.  Moss creates a sense of the time with the rubble of London, bombed tirelessly and Paris, left comparatively untouched, of the Nuremberg trials and executions of Nazi war crimes, of Odessa activities, good guys cloak and dagger action and a neat view of LGBTQ legal issues in Australia, where homosexual acts were still criminalized, and Paris, where they were not.<br /><br />All in all this was a fun, wanted to keep getting back to it, story.  Well written and well conceived.",positive
"ALMOST MIDNIGHT (MIKE BOWDITCH MYSTERIES) is the tenth entry in this entertaining series featuring Maine game warden Mike Bowditch (the first is [[ASIN:1250161657 The Poacher’s Son]]); it works fine as a standalone.  The author does a marvelous job of immersing the reader in the remote Maine woods scene.  The plot involves administrative corruption within a Maine prison (corruption that causes a few inmate deaths), but it mostly centers on Mike’s search for the person who shot--and probably mortally wounded--his escaped dog/wolf (Shadow) with a crossbow.<br /><br />In the novel, Mike’s incarcerated best friend (Billy Cronk) urgently summons him to the Maine State Prison, and asks him to investigate the new CO, a sergeant named Dawn Richie.  Mike barely gets started before Richie is ambushed and wounded in the prison laundry room.  The ambush leaves a prison guard dead, and lands two inmates (one is Billy) in the nearest hospital.  More mayhem ensues when one of the injured inmates gets loose and takes a nurse hostage.<br /><br />When the situation clears, Mike concentrates on identifying Shadow’s attacker.  This puts him in touch with a crazy North Woods distiller (Alcohol Mary), a newly established Amish enclave, a young couple dwelling in a yurt, and a wealthy, homicidal landowner (Gorman Peaslee) who is determined to eradicate the Amish.  Mike also touches base with many game warden friends, and pursues his relationship with Dani Tate.<br /><br />The novel illustrates the changes occuring in northern Maine (e.g., the local impact of the closing of a huge paper mill).  It paints a very detailed picture of the area, but it never, ever reads like a travelogue.  The characters are extremely well-developed.  The plot is interesting, though it is driven by Mike’s pursuit of Shadow’s attacker far more than by the murders of the humans, and the Shadow plot gets tiresome over the course of a full-length novel.  The action-packed conclusion is both exciting and satisfying.",positive

"If I have to read another book about Carrie, wait..I won't read another book about Carrie.  I loved the Kay Scarpitta series and how it developed.  I read every one of them in order.  Then Carrie came back and is shoved down our throats. Even I could write a book if I developed a character who could be anywhere undetected anytime and who knew where everyone else was all the time. The characters are getting stuck on hold with no development or growth except when they are with Desi.  Lucy is a great character when she gets to do something.  Benton has little personality anymore.  We are stuck in two houses for 24 hours with a lot of repetition.  Also, did I miss something?

"I'm not thrilled with this book. My kids love logic, so I thought this would be right up their alley. Many of the brain teasers have to be seen to be understood, so it isn't something you can really read aloud or use for a classroom. The alien narrating the book gives you their pronouns in their introduction. They also use really weird names that are hard to pronounce and use made up words for the aliens and their planet, which make some of the brain teasers really incoherent. My kids didn't like the puzzles all that much. Most of them were super simple, which isn't any fun. We just didn't have much fun with this book.",negative

The summary is pretty spot on with the content of the book.<br />Aurora the female lead was written perfectly snarky, competent and as untrustworthy as a normal teen girl. I did think that her not trusting the boys with the truth of her existence the entire book was a bit annoying. I know this was so there could be a book two but in the moment it was frustrating. I liked her clean relationship with all the boys and her connection with Ayden. That was cute, not over done.

While this is a fictional story, there are lots of historical details that bring this story to life. I have read some fictional books that took place in Hawaii during this same time period and found this interesting since it was from the point of view of a 9 year old girl. The illustrations are beautiful. There's a glossary in the back that has a lot of the Hawaiian words in it. Overall, it's a great book and not just for fans of the American Girl world.",positive
"The author starts each chapter by writing a letter to his baby daughter, which is very touching. What follows those letters, are small words of wisdom. Unfortunately, none of the quotes before page 42 resonated with me and many others throughout the book are equally cryptic. However, after page 42, the inspiring messages to his daughter and us increased exponentially. As a result, this book is a gem for those about thirty quotes I found that made perfect sense. If it were not for those messages, I would have been disappointed in this book.<br /><br />INSPIRING EXAMPLES:<br /><br />""Thinking big but acting small is the same thing as thinking small.""<br /><br />""Only do those things you want to do with whom you want to do them""<br /><br />""Dimming your light in sadness or empathy over the suffering of others doesn't help anyone""<br /><br />""Nothing you might ever do can ensure anyone else's happiness.""",positive

"Fashion-conscious Kelly expects her study abroad in Rome to turn her into a designer superstar, but fate has other plans in store. When Kelly and her friend Sheela land in Rome, they find out that a) they're NOT staying in some grand villa, b) the rooms are super-tiny, c) they're on the fifth floor (and NO elevator) and d) the air conditioning doesn't work.<br /><br />Kelly can't seem to make friends with her suitemates Marina (""Goth Girl""), vegan Lisa, or timid Minnie, so she takes up dating the fast and dangerous Joe, a blond surfer type who always seems to find trouble wherever he goes. This leads to very serious consequences for all involved; Joe's stunts result in expulsion for at least one student.<br />In fact, out of the several S.A.S.S. books I've read, this is the first one that features noticeable drug use.<br /><br />Kelly has real artistic talent, but she can't seem to get her personal life together once in Rome. She's constantly late to classes after breaking curfew every night with Joe, misses assignments, and is refused entrance to the Vatican because of her skimpy clothing. But after a pivotal event mid-book, she cleans up her act (although it appears that she never learns Italian) and tries to make the most out of the time that she has left.<br /><br />Peggy Guthart Strauss includes lots of great details about daily life in Italy, particularly in her descriptions of artwork, and maybe more importantly, Italian food! Kelly gets to visit various regions of Italy, including stops in Tuscany, Naples, and Pompeii. During the course of the summer, she learns that appearance isn't everything; she loosens up and learns to enjoy the company of her new classmates, even if they're not the sort of people that she would hang out with back home in Chicago. She also stands up to the bullying Joe after he makes fun of her new friends. This was a quick, entertaining read that really brought modern Italy to life.",positive
"This is a very thin book that's a very quick read. I read this in a little over one hour.  It's about one woman's quest to find out where her cat Tibby was for the 5 weeks he went missing written in a very lighthearted and silly way.<br /><br />She uses different methods to track down his previous whereabouts such as a camera, GPS, psychic, animal communicator, etc.  The story is both funny at times and very silly at other times.  The book ends with a message of how we often think of technology first before thinking of a simpler way of finding out what we want.<br /><br />I did enjoy this story.  However, based on the title I thought it was a book about a lost cat whose owner uses GPS technology to find her cat--not so.  Instead she uses this and other technology and methods AFTER her cat returns home.<br /><br />I think many cat lovers can relate to the author's feelings and enjoy this lighthearted read. I also think some young adults would have fun reading this.",positive

"If you want to learn how to smuggle and sell endangered butterflies, read this book! It recounts, in detail, the recorded conversations between a notorious butterfly seller/smuggler and an undercover U.S. Fish and Wildlife investigator that culminated in multiple illegal sales and deliveries of the world's most-protected, most-critically-endangered butterflies (Alexandrae, homerus, chikae, and hospiton).<br /><br />On the basis of this recorded evidence, the seller was ultimately arrested, convicted, and confined for two years in a U.S. federal prison. However, the conversations as reported also reveal the seller's methods for (1) gathering the critically endangered butterflies so prized by collectors, (2) disguising the specimens as legal butterflies, (3) shipping the CITES-protected butterflies across international borders, and (4) avoiding getting caught even if the illegal merchandise is intercepted.<br /><br />According to the publisher, the author of this book is a freelance journalist who specializes in wildlife enforcement issues. No doubt she wrote this book to call attention to the ineffectiveness of current methods of enforcing laws designed to protect endangered species. (For example, the book tells us that the butterfly seller's packages were always delivered, even though the undercover agent had alerted customs officials to be on the lookout.) Unfortunately, because the book offers no suggestions for better enforcement, it does no more than explain how and why the illegal butterfly trade goes on. Indeed, at the end of the book, the butterfly seller is conducting business as usual in Japan, because he still has the best butterfly contacts in the entire world.<br /><br />The book recounts the investigation as if the Fish and Wildlife investigator were telling his own story. It is a mildly interesting story of what it takes to carry out an undercover law enforcement operation. (Among other things, it helps to be a person who has learned as a child to concoct believable lies for protection from bullies, and who is trained as a lawyer.) However, the book is NOT recommended reading for young people, because of the extensive quotations of lewd remarks made by the seller that reveal his infatuation with the Fish and Wildlife investigator.",negative

I had never heard before that some Caucasian ministers of Japanese churches followed their congregations to internment camps. Talk about living out your faith! Kirby Larson is a wonderful writer, as proved by the success of Hattie Big Sky, which is also a great read. I recommend ""Fences"" to any history buff, and I believe this book could hook even an anti- history person into enjoying it!

"Alex Cross is involved in some of the most intriguing murder investigations to hit DC in a while. So in between planning his wedding (to Detective Bree Stone), and parenting his kids, Alex must also juggle several complicated investigations. One deals with a pair of snipers (who are killing influential people believed to have been involved in corruption); while the other involves a killer who is leaving complicated mathematical equations on his victim's bodies. Oh yeah, and by the way, did I mention the fact that his nemesis (Kyle Craig) has reemerged (having escaped prison) and is bent on revenge. Kyle has even gone so far as to change his face (to that of undercover FBI Agent Max Siegel), just so that he can insert himself into the investigation. As the investigation progress, Max (AKA Kyle) wants nothing more than to goad Alex at every turn, even adding to the confusion with some copy cat murders.<br /><br />To me, this was a typical Alex Cross novel. There were one or two small surprises, but otherwise it lived up to my expectation (which wasn't much). Regardless, as the book comes to a semi-anticlimactic end, you wonder is it all over (and those who know the series will know what I mean) or has Patterson once again given us a red herring. What I am sure of is that we haven't seen the last of Alex or his grisly investigations.",negative

"I am a chopped fan and thought this would be an interesting addition to my cookbook collection.  I would have preferred a spiral back.  So it would stay open as you're using it.... thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  Other than that, it has some very interesting, doable recipes.  The pictures are lovely, however, not on every recipe, just FYI.  Some are little more involved than I will probably get, but it does have some recipes with some out of the usual ingredients that would be challenging to try.  Over all, it's a great cook book!",positive

"When I saw the comparison of this book to A WRINKLE IN TIME, I was very intrigued. I read WRINKLE in seventh grade and loved it. And I'm sorry, there is no comparison.<br /><br />Yes, I am a lot older than seventh grade now, and you may think that has colored my review of this book. But I remember what I was reading at age ""10 and up,"" which is what is the age range for this book is: Albert Payson Terhune and JOHNNY TREMAIN and THE GREEN POODLES and THE GOOD MASTER and its sequel, and NATIONAL VELVET. And compared to any of those, especially A WRINKLE IN TIME, this book is terribly shallow. There is a stereotypical unusual kid, who despite being a child genius is having a conflict with an older sibling, she's got nice parents who overprotect her because she's bullied because of her genius--everything by the numbers. You don't get any deeper into the characters than that--they're all very superficial. By the end of A WRINKLE IN TIME I feel I know each of the Murry family members (even Sandy and Dennys, who only have a small role); in this book the characters are like paper. Plus Lily is being a brat and her parents just shrug it off as her ""just being a teenager"" and having hormones. Since when does that excuse her from being a brat?<br /><br />The scientific principles are presented in a very understandable manner for ""10 and up,"" and Maisie's unique solution to the problem is neat, but it doesn't make up for the 2D characters accompanying them.",negative

"I am appalled by this book and by the author's stance towards the children he taught. This is a book filled with his own failure, which he turns into loathing of poor black and brown kids. Most teachers have been in a tough position at some point. And the good ones find a way to master their own sense of balance, their craft, and to structure a class and day that inspires kids to do better. The portraits he paints of his students are caricatures of the ugliest kind. Worst, he fails to realize that fear and loathing will never bring kids around- only love will. Even more enraging, he uses his time with them to make more money.",negative

"WRITTEN IN BLOOD introduces Joe “Preach” Everson, a damaged cop tasked with solving a series of murders staged like famous literary murders (Dostoevsky, Poe, Christie, Nabokov).  That’s two current mystery/thriller cliches out of the way!  Everson is probably healed by the end, but he isn’t all that interesting while damaged—his troubled mind is mostly useful for showcasing introspective reflections on the inhumanity of man.  (Everson is to be forgiven, perhaps, because he’s a former preacher.)<br /><br />The novel is reasonably well-plotted, but NOT so well written.  Important details about the characters get lost in the verbiage of the early chapters, so that even the reader attentive for clues may find him/herself asking, “Where did I read before about that character’s background?” as specific items are referenced later.  The narrative also includes a number of unnecessary, jarring similes (e.g., “He wished he was inside the lounge, … eating a bone-in rib eye as rare as a blue diamond” (ch. 34; uses two different meanings of “rare”)).<br /><br />Also, there’s a heck of a lot of literary criticism, fed to Joe by his love interest, a bookstore clerk/comparative lit major/law student named Ari.  As nearly as I can tell, the analysis of the context of the literary murders added nothing to the actual solution of the murders.<br /><br />Layton Green is the author of the Dominic Grey series (beginning with [[ASIN:1477805087 The Summoner]], which I liked a little better.",negative
"Just because you like mysteries with some fun and humor mixed in, that may not be enough to carry you through 459 pages.  It wasn’t enough for me!  There was too much fantasy, too much things didn’t always appear to be what they were, too many twists, and not enough meat.  Perhaps I give myself away when I tell you that I did not stand in line for Harry Potter books or movies, either.<br /><br />I fear that I have become a serious reader, needing characters based upon people I know, locations I have heard of or visited and a mystery that Agatha Christie might write.  I tried.  I tried and put this down too many times - and finally decided that I could still provide a service for those who pick this up expecting one thing and finding another as I did.<br /><br />I did enjoy the writing style, the descriptions, the detail - and I appreciate the unbelievable imagination the author had in creating this tome.  I just couldn’t get into the story.",negative
"The Sinatra Treasures is yet another look at Frank Sinatra's life and career, this time with never-before-published quotes, more than 200 black-and-white and color images from several Sinatra archives and 30 removable facsimile reproductions of items (scripts, a Sinatra photo album). Also included is a CD with an hour's worth of rare interviews and songs, including Frank singing a parody of ""High Hopes"" for presidential hopeful John F. Kennedy's campaign.<br /><br />The author, Charles Pignone, is a Sinatra family archivist and has written liner notes for several Sinatra releases. He has been president of the Sinatra Society of America since 1984.<br /><br />The book opens with recollections from Quincy Jones and Frank Sinatra Jr. The first chapter charmingly opens with a ""cast of characters."" Early mementos include a New York Giants scorecard (1942) and ""Frank Fare"" (1943), an early Sinatra fan magazine. Other gems include a 1944 program script and copies of later programs, telegraphs, and photos.<br /><br />This is probably only going to have lasting appeal for the die-hard Sinatra collector; it's overkill for the casual fan, and will probably only warrant flipping through once or twice. Also, although the removable mementos are a neat idea, the paper sleeves they come in are very flimsy and tear easily.",positive
This great as a family recipe keeper and then make a gift of it.  The best part is the spiral binding which helps it stay open while you're using it.  The down side? If you want to consider it... there is no projection for the paper pages you're writing on while cooking - they are just plain paper that is not terribly thick.  I still like it as a keepsake.

"SURRENDER, NEW YORK is a 604-page tome, densely packed with long, long sentences and flowery language.  The opening sentence is almost worthy of a Bulwer-Lytton award:  &#34;The case did not so much burst upon as creep over Burgoyne County, New York, just as the sickness that underlay it only took root in the region slowly, insidiously, and long before the first body was found.&#34;<br /><br />I like historical mysteries, and I'm generally not bothered by a 19th-century writing style that's adopted to create a period atmosphere.  However, the narrator in this novel is a psychologist who delivers lectures on the need to restore psychology and profiling to the &#34;positions of respect&#34; they occupied before forensics took over criminal investigations in the early 1990s.  To me, it's simply not credible that a 21st-century narrator would talk like Trajan Jones.<br /><br />I wanted to read this novel because I'd heard that the author's earlier work, THE ALIENIST, was very good.  Unfortunately, this one is simply too daunting for me.  Mystery/thriller fiction is my bedtime reading, and the sheer weight and length of the book makes it inappropriate for that.  While the writing will no doubt be effective at putting me to sleep, it will take me several years to get through the work. I give up, and I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",negative

"I was lured to read this novel by the setting, knowing very little about Mt. Vesuvius and the devastation it caused to the town of Pompeii.  That, I found very interesting.  I started losing believability in the characters as I was thrown back and forth between 79 AD and 1902.<br /><br />I realize that dialogue is very difficult when you create two living environments - but the disparity between the thoughts and speech in 79 AD and 1902 just didn’t ring true in either era.  It proved to be very distracting to this reader, as I fought with the impossibility of a young girl in 79 AD sounding just like Emily and Ivy in 1902.<br /><br />This was my first Lady Emily, and perhaps the author’s loyal fans can roll with this - I couldn’t, and frankly gave it up half way through.  I rarely stop reading a book, but this was not a comfortable read, and I couldn’t conjure up the determination to see it through to the end.<br /><br />I salute the author for the research she did to make the Pompeii scene very interesting and informative.  And  I salute her, too, for taking on a very difficult time swing in creating two separate tales -  and weaving them together.",negative
"I did not think I would enjoy this book. My husband and I are replanting a church and we're in the same area as the West Ridge Church. Knowing their church, I did not think I would like this book at all. Their church is so different from ours. Their values so different. Their focus so different. I did not think they'd have anything to say to me, really. I was wrong. This book has a lot of practical advice for church planters. I don't necessarily agree with all of it. I would not necessarily make the same family choices they make. But overall the book was helpful. It helps you think about your calling, your priorities, and how your life as you start the church planting journey will change. Even if you are well into the trenches of church planting, it is never too late to rethink our priorities. It is never too late to fine tune that balance between church and family life. How and when to mix the two. How and when to keep the two separate. I was definitely blessed by this book.",positive

The supposed Watson and Holmes characterisations are cartoonish, the dialogue leaden and unimaginative, and the two supposed hooks - Queen Victoria and Supernatural Influences - are both completely bogus, having basically zero to do with the poor attempt at a plot.

"DROID COMPANION is a decent book, but it doesn't cover my Motorola Droid Razr (Model XT912).  Because the book is made up of screen shots with instructions that walk you through the use of specific buttons, it wasn't helpful to me.  For example, it discusses the  ""Menu"" button (with 4 squares) as an important navigational aid, but my phone doesn't have that button. (The equivalent, I think, is the permanent icon with the lines at the bottom left.)<br /><br />The Droid Razr is my first smartphone (okay, call me a Luddite), so I wanted a Droid phone manual that was pretty basic.  Mainly I wanted to know which buttons did what, so that I wouldn't run up unexpected charges or fail to use good features out of ignorance.  This book probably would have done most of what I wanted if Motorola hadn't completely revised the Droid display.  But the book teaches by taking you step-by-step through pressing buttons, so it's not a fast way to learn about your phone, even if your phone is covered.<br /><br />Because of the slow step-by-step method, I rate DROID COMPANION at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  Be sure to check your Droid model before ordering:  this book covers the Motorola Droid 3, Motorola Droid X2, HTC Droid Incredible 2, and the Samsung Droid Charge.",positive
"Francesca ""Cesca"" Marinelli is a tour guide with a ghost tour company in St. Augustine. In her spare time, she loves all-night shopping at Wal-Mart, learning how to salsa and surf, and studying design. So far, so good, right? Except for the fact that Cesca's a vampire who hates the smell of blood (it literally makes her sick), goes out during the daytime if the sun's not too strong, doesn't use her vamp powers, and she's on the prowl for Mr. Right. After being buried for most of her (undead) life, she's determined to live her life to the fullest. As a vampire, she's required to wear a tracking chip and to have a human sponsor, but other than these small inconveniences, her life is pretty normal. Like Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire novels, there is a violent anti-vampire group, the Covenant, that seeks to find and destroy vamps.<br /><br />Cesca is a refreshing narrator; a psychic, her take-no-prisoners attitude is tested when she's involved in a murder investigation; special investigator Deke Saber rubs her the wrong way. Cesca's never been romantically involved, and Deke starts to get on her nerves in other ways that she didn't expect. Cesca starts to resent all the happy couples that surround her and fears that she'll be single forever, but fate has other plans.<br /><br />Things get weirder for Cesca as the same tourists appear for repeat ghost tours (and yes, ghosts do make appearances), and a mysterious magical cat follows her around. As the evidence piles up, so does the danger facing Cesca and her friends. There was enough suspense without being overly gory, and enough twists and turns that I was left guessing until the end. A fun, fast-paced blend of romance, suspense, and magic, La Vida Vampire was a rockin' read and I can't wait for more of Cesca's adventures in [[ASIN:0425227545 Last Vampire Standing]].",positive
"Usually I'm a bit suspicious of any book that claims desserts with quick prep times, expecting them to rely heavily on packaged and chemical-laden shortcuts.<br /><br />So I was very pleasantly surprised by ""The Weeknight Dessert Cookbook"" by Mary Younkin.<br /><br />Containing 80 recipes for puddings, refrigerator pies, bars, cookies, and cakes, you'll find a diverse collection of classics like pound cake and chocolate chip cookies mixed in with treats like black forest bars, chocolate blueberry brownies, cranberry lemon scone cookies, and chocolate caramel pecan pound cake.<br /><br />There are no boxed mixes here, everything is whipped up from scratch (note that the 5-15 minutes refers only to the prep; the baking still takes normal time).<br /><br />As a single household, I also loved that many of the cakes and desserts are geared towards 1-5 servings in many cases, meaning no need to halve the recipe or have too many leftovers (most of these treats freeze well if so).<br /><br />Measurements / temperatures are given in US as well as metric.<br /><br />I look forward to purchasing Ms. Younkin's ""Weeknight Dinners"" and ""Weekday Lunches and Breakfasts"" on the strength of this title; if you enjoy baking but are in a crunch for time, this will become your new best friend to get delicious desserts on the table that the whole family will enjoy!",positive

"This novel had all the potential--a dramatic reason for the main character's move from France to Ireland, the broken-hearted actions of our characters, did I say Ireland?, oh, and a cute title.  However, it was all too dramatic and over the top for me.  All the angst for the main character and others really came to naught over and over again.

"&quot;An Island Like You&quot; first came to my attention as I was searching for books by Judith Ortiz Cofer.

I just received &quot;Una isla como tu&quot; last week after deciding that I wanted to read the book in the true language of the characters, and I wasn't disappointed by the translation.<br />The Spanish novel is every bit as compelling and graceful as its English counterpart, and great care is taken not to change any of the details. I believe that reading this novel in Spanish makes these stories of the barrio even more authentic, and this is an excellent translation that shouldn't be missed.

"I listened to every word of this doleful, vulgar, seamy book while driving across the country. I knew it was an adult book and not intended for children but it is as though Ms Rowling set out to prove that in spite of her previous wonderful books she can write one that is as depressed and depressing as she is.  The book is a bloodbath of death, dark events, the foulest of language (how can a WOMAN so casually and frequently use a nasty word that denigrates all women???). There is not one happy person or one happy event in it and it rapidly sucks all the joy out of the reader. Most of the characters die, including an innocent child. It is not just gritty, but grimy. All the characters hate one another, cheat on one another, kill or want to kill one another, and there is no humor or lightness of tone anywhere in it.  I'm glad I only rented the CD set and didn't give her very much of my money for producing this kind of writing.  I knew it was an adult book but I wasn't prepared for it to be an expression of Ms. Rowling's ongoing clinical depression.  Good literature raises one up and inspires one to greatness; it doesn't drag one down into mud and guts and misery like this book.  Skip it altogether until she writes a decent one, and read one of the pieces of great literature that explore the development of GOOD character and have exciting, rewarding plots, like ""Shane"" or ""Rebecca"". Neither of these have happy endings, but they are well written, well plotted, and well developed. I'm not a prude and I'm not hung up on political correctness, but how can we condemn Paul Dean for using the N-word decades ago and not condemn  J K Rowling for currently using - PUBLISHING, even - the C-word repeatedly in this horrible, awful, depressing, joyless book???<br />This book is lacking decency in any form.

"The author gets the ideas of concurrency vs parallelism confused.  He is a domain expert on threading in C++ and it would be great if he got this also correct.  For example, saying that the number of cores in a machine reflects the number of threads that can truly run concurrently is getting the concept all wrong.  Concurrency is ONLY when processes may be started and ended in overlapping periods of time.  Number of cores has nothing to do with this.<br /><br />The book does cover what you expect which is when to use moves vs copies and caveats of using the thread libraries in C++ 2011.

"I guess I identify with characters who react to situations as I would.  I feel frustrated by characters who know that digging out answers will solve their problem, but, for some reason, don't feel ready to do the digging..so postpone and mess around until you want to scream, ""For heaven's sakes, just do it!""  I also feel frustrated by side stories that distract, and really don't add to the main action.  And, the knitting dialogue, which goes into needless detail...puleeze....  I love the warmth of a knitting shop as much as the next person, but, unless a particular yarn or pattern figures into the story, don't bog me down with it!  The premise of this book is intriguing, and calls upon us all to think about how we would react to a similar situation - but when our main characters drag their feet and parse the problem to an excrutiating extreme, one wants to yell, ""Enough!""

"If you can’t join ‘em, beat ‘em to death seems to be Putin’s motto. The USA, Canada and EU turned it’s back on Russia and kept NATO intact. So Putin, who was always wary of the West as much as it was wary of him, decided to destroy it instead. Using old fascist techniques, mainly in Ukraine, Putin turned on the US and Europe to destroy its unity and diversity against it. Spiking White supremacy and Russian Nationalism in Ukraine, Putin and Russian oligarchs used the internet to cause disunity. The author, Timothy Snyder, points out in his discussion that even fascism had roots in admiration of American white supremacy and the KKK even in the 30s. A flag Russians in Ukraine use looks very similar to the Confederate battle flag and that White Americans in sizable numbers ha e never been willing to accept a democratic society shared equally with minorities.

"Given the easy-to-read writing style and the introspective heroine, THE BOOK OF SECOND CHANCES would appear to be aimed at a young adult audience--but that can’t be right, because the heroine (Emily) is 28 years old.  When the novel opens, Emily is living alone in a home that she shared with her recently deceased grandmother (Catriona, a beloved children’s book author).  Emily is barely functioning, because she relied on Catriona for everything--companionship, food and shelter, and work as Catriona’s illustrator.<br /><br />Fortunately for Emily, Catriona foresaw Emily’s predicament, and took steps to forestall her granddaughter’s descent into hopeless depression.  Catriona left everything she owned to Emily (bank accounts, book rights, furniture, etc.), with one exception.  This was the rented home that she and her granddaughter had shared for many years, and the home could also be Emily’s--if Emily would follow a series of clues and find a secret.  If Emily found the secret before the lease was up (in 10 days), she would be able to purchase the home at fair market value.<br /><br />At this point, I gave up.  The world doesn’t need another “treasure hunt” novel where the main character follows clues in order to uncover a life-changing or history-changing secret--or at least it doesn’t need another one with weak characters and plotting, where the only reason to keep on reading is to see what the next clue will be.<br /><br />At the novel’s beginning, Emily is so helpless (she is an extremely immature young adult, who is angry at her grandmother for leaving her), and the prize is so boring (a house), that I simply don’t care what happens next.  Also, the whole premise--that a dying Catriona would set up a treasure hunt for Emily which required a whole series of different people to timely contact or interact with Emily to make it work--is not only unbelievable, it is fantastical and weird.",negative

"This hurts.  I've admired Dr. Longo's ingenuity, creativity and genius for a while now.  Loved one of his documentaries on FireStick...watched podcasts and interviews.  Loved each and every single one of them.<br /><br />Then I bought this book.  It all fell appart for me.  I'd have returned it if it wasn't because I had earmarked a few pages.<br /><br />First few parts of the book are mostly autobiographical.  Call me crazy but I was not that interested in that portion of the book.  I mean, he's lead a very rich life, I just don't want to pay to hear about it.  Tell me all about it over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, for free.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a huge sale on his Prolon FMD product.  Which is fine.  I'd would have loved to know what I was getting myself into before actually paying to buy advertising.<br /><br />IF, and that is a big IF, you are not familiar at all with fasting and its benefits it will serve you better to watch his documentary.  Also, there is another great documentary about fasting, etc. called The Science of Fasting.  Both are great.<br /><br />IF you are unable to fast for health or weight loss due to health issues or social issues or whatever, then sure, you can pay to get the FMD Prolon info from his book ...or...you could get it for free on his website.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone not waste their hard earned pesos.",negative
"I AM AN HVAC INSTRUCTOR I HAVE USED MANY TEXT BOOKS TO TEACH FROM. THIS BOOK IS, BY FAR, THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.

"Thank you so much to NetGalley.com and BooksGoSocial.com for my copy of “My African Craving” by Audrey Flynn. This book was fabulous from beginning to end and like an African lion, I devoured it in one sitting.<br /><br />The author certainly does not waste any time before throwing the reader right into the steamy action. I love books that have strong, well-defined characters and especially ones with an independent leading lady (girl power right?) and this book does not disappoint. Right from the opening page, through to the last, the writing is fresh and fast-paced and will leave you wanting more. <br /><br />The main protagonist of the story is Erica Knight. She is a high-flying executive for a big mining company, that arrives in Lebombo Game Reserve with a view to negotiating mining rights there. Thinking she will be able to walk in and out with an easy deal, Erica is certainly not prepared for the reserve’s enigmatic owner, Jean-Luc de Graaf, who turns out to be more than just a hot Game Keeper in khakis.<br /><br /> This book has everything that a romance reader could want. It has passion, adventure, a landscape to die for and most importantly a great storyline. I promise you it's not just Africa that is hot in this book; the chemistry between the main characters is on fire and you will be left fanning yourself long after the final page has been turned. I loved this book so much and cannot wait to read more by Audrey Flynn.",positive

"Let it be known: I am a train nut. A VIA Rail nut, to be more specific. So when I heard about this great little mystery about a murder aboard the Canadian from Winnipeg to Vancouver, I had to read it! ""Murder on the Canadian"" was a short read, but a very enjoyable one.<br />Protagonist Tom Austen wants to become a detective like his idols the Hardy Boys. Tom knows all the techniques: fingerprinting, poisons, collecting evidence and interrogating suspects, but when his vacation turns to a real murder investigation he gets more than he bargained for.<br />The beautiful Catherine Saks has been murdered in her room, apparently by her drunk, jealous husband. There are a number of suspects, and Tom has to move quickly and carefully to avoid being caught. The case takes a number of interesting twists and turns, including Tom nearly being abandoned in a small town, a poisoned omelette, and a fight in a railway tunnel with the killer.<br />Vivid descriptions, steady pacing and plenty of great conversations, as well as several action-packed sequences make this an enjoyable read for mystery and train fans of all ages.",positive
"This is a really large coloring book. It has some really fun pictures to color. It isn't super high quality. It is more like the lower end coloring books in paper and print type, but it is very big. Mine arrived damaged, which was really annoying since I was sending it as a gift. It is really the nature of a coloring book cover to get damaged, so I'm not too very upset about that and it didn't change the quality of the book itself. My 5 year old really likes the book and it has provided many hours of entertainment for him.",positive
I actually made a pilgrimage to Israel in 2011 and used this book as a sort of a guide to the history and the legacy of the country and its people.

I learned a lot about this magnificent country and it was a very enjoyable read.,positive
"At only 167 pages, this is a quick easy read, which I liked because I don't have a lot of time to read.  The author packs a lot into those pages.  He covers 5 common sayings that Christians sometimes say or believe, but aren't really quite what the Bible says or what Jesus taught.  I won't list them here, as they are in the product description.  One of the things that struck me is that God does not control us like puppets and everything is not predestined.  We have free will, but neither does he set us totally free to stumble along through life without any help  The author believes that the truth is somewhere in between where God is more like a parent, guiding when we want help or need it.  Not every thing in life is micromanaged by God.  God probably doesn't care if you pick corn, peas or carrots as your vegetable for a meal.  Another important point - God does not promise life to be free of trouble, pain or temptation, but instead promises to be there for us to help us get through it.  There are so many other good points in this book that I can't even list them all in a short review.  I think this book is a MUST READ for Christians and interesting reading for those who are not, because they might have heard some of the 5 sayings from Christians and now they can understand why and what the true meaning of the scripture is and where these half truths came from.  I don't read very many &#34;religious&#34; books, but this was well worth the time to read it.  It is never boring and he gives a lot of stories and a little humor from time to time as well.",positive
"Out of about 100 books bought in the last 2 months for our two year old, this is the only one that we're returning and don't want to read to him. It's not that what other reviews praise about the story and pictures isn't true, it's just that the story and pictures also depict values and actions that we are not comfortable exposing to our young child although I seriously considered keeping the book for myself because I personally liked it. The main character is not a very good role model. (Because we are both parents and early childhood and elementary educators, we may be more attuned to and concerned about role models in books, which may not be as big of an issue or concern to others so this book may be fine depending on one's particular sensitivies and orientation.) Not every child is a childhood prodigy like Farkle McBride and particularly with certain issues that surround children in today's American culture and media, I am concerned about a child being exposed to a character who can master something without trying that hard or practicing or sticking to it and who easily gives up what they're doing because they get bored. Though not automatically negative, there's a bit of concern that a message is being sent suggesting that the one who is in charge (e.g. the conductor) has a better job than the others. Though amusing from an adult point of view, the book has images of instruments being broken in pieces or thrown away because the child is bored of them - not a good model for caring for personal property and respecting the investment (monetary and time) made by his parents to support his interests. We love Lithgow's other children's CDs and some of his other works but considering the selection of books out there, I think one can easily make a better choice for stories about children and music (e.g. for whole orchestra books try ""Zin, Zin, Zin, A Vioin"", the Gustav Mole books, ""The Hippo Hop"", ""The Story of the Incredible Orchestra"", and for less than full orchestra books, ""Mole Music"", ""Song and Dance Man"").",negative
"I wanted to enjoy it, truly I did. Robert B. Parker was my all time favorite go to author. I truly mourned his passing. No one could equal him at writing his own characters but I wanted to give this a try figuring his estate couldn't possibly let dreck be published in his name.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I got to the end of the first chapter and couldn't go on. It was nothing like Mr. Parker, nothing at all. Traitorous and sophomoric.  There is probably better fan written fiction for free on the internet. I just don't understand, although I am truly happy for the reviewers who rate it 3, 4 & 5 stars - I wish I could have.",negative

"HOW TO MAKE A SPACESHIP:  A BAND OF RENEGADES, AN EPIC RACE, AND THE BIRTH OF PRIVATE SPACEFLIGHT recounts how the experimental, rocket-powered, privately-funded aircraft SpaceShipOne was conceived and developed; and how SpaceShipOne ultimately came to win the Ansari X Prize ($10 million) for the first successful nongovernmental, reusable, manned spacecraft.  People that contributed to the project in various ways include Paul Allen, Peter Diamandis, Burt Rutan, Mike Melvill, Doug Shane, Steve Bennett, Dumitru Popescu, and many others.<br /><br />The book is extremely well-organized and readable, but it's primarily of interest to readers who are already somewhat familiar with the X Prize and SpaceShipOne.  The Prologue, which ends with a cliffhanger--in the middle of a trouble-plagued SpaceShipOne test flight--wasn't enough by itself to sustain my interest for the 300 pages that intervened before the rest of the test flight story was told.  That said, I think that anyone who dreams either of working on private space flight projects or of someday participating directly in space flight should enjoy this book immensely.  I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",positive

Unless someone's talking, all you have to do is skim and you'll get the idea of what's currently happening just fine. Don't bother reading every word.<br /><br />Most of the book is very repetitive and not very much happens. Blah.<br /><br />When someone is talking, the author uses &#34;you see&#34; waaaaayy too much, and often without a comma after it. She uses the word &#34;Ok&#34; instead of &#34;Okay&#34; or &#34;okay&#34; or even &#34;ok.&#34; No, it it's always &#34;Ok&#34; even in the middle of a sentence. Also uses &#34;of course&#34; too much, and &#34;anyways&#34; is not a word.<br /><br />ANYWAY, I liked the story well enough by the end of the book, but it's not really enough to keep me going so I probably will not buy the next book.

"I received this book as a gift from my dear daughter and I appreciated it and enjoyed it -- up until page 119.  There, authors Dutcher's release their version of CWT  -- Critical Wolf Theory.  No, they don't use that term but their anti Christian message is crystal clear.  They write, ""With the rise of Christianity... it reached a population [Europe] that increasingly envisioned itself as separate from nature.  It couldn't have helped that Christians adopted the motif of God the Shepherd.""  No, Mr. and Mrs. Dutcher, Christians didn't ""adopt"" the motif of God the Shepherd.  The 23rd Psalm, one of the most beloved and moving scriptures, was GIVEN to us by God.  Christ himself said, ""I am the good shepherd."" (John 10:11)  Shepherding was a common occupation during Biblical times and it was something everyone could understand; and yes, wolves did attack flocks of sheep; and yes, the job of the shepherd was to protect their flock.  It is a symbolism that I, and billions of people, cherish.  Never in my life have I imaged this symbolism as a basis for hatred of wolves.  In fact, I support wolf reintroduction, I have ""adopted"" a wolf at NWF, and I give regularly to NWF.

"What a disappointment. The initial blurb on this book had all the things I like in a story.... A post apocalypse future, fun advanced technology and a mystery. Yet, the entire story was just so scattershot and drifty that I lost interest quickly each time I picked up the book. I tried four times to read this and just couldn't finish it - I simply had no connection to any of the characters or the plot.<br /><br />Nothing is really explained or described completely. The opening pages show a very vague idea of the &#34;Feed&#34; and how the population is fully addicted/integrated with it, but there's only one scene in a restaurant and then the story leaps five years ahead after a terrorist attack. There was no real exploration of the Feed&#34; based civilization so the loss of it just feels sudden and meaningless. The current environment is never fleshed out fully either. We get the impression that life is austere and starvation lurks around the corner, but it's sort of an afterthought.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the lead character, Tom is pretty unlikeable. He comes across in the first pages as emotionally abusive and controlling with his wife. My dislike of Tom never abated. The rest of the characters are pretty flat and one dimensional. Life is simply too short to spend with tedious books.",negative

"I'm not really sure why I thought the author was Catholic, but she isn't. She's Reformed. Which is fine. I'm not Catholic, either. I just assumed she was. Even reformed though, I would say this particular book crosses over most of those boundaries. Protestant or Catholic, this book is really just Christian. And I can absolutely appreciate that.<br />As for the actual content, this book is actually more of a companion to her book [[ASIN:0736960074 It's Great to Be a Girl!: A Guide to Your Changing Body (Secret Keeper Girl® Series)]]. You can use it without that book, but she mentions it pretty constantly. (I do not have, nor have I read the girl book.)

"Where do I begin?  I suppose with one star for a mere attempt of writing a novel !!  Unfortunately, I sent this book in hardcopy to a friend for her birthday. I also downloaded it on my Kindle so that we could read it together and discuss it when completed.  Midway, I texted my friend to apologize for the upsetting content of child abuse among the dominate three characters. (in three days, she still has not responded). Except for nutrition-starvation, the mention of all other forms of child abuse was dominant and described in almost every chapter. I do not find pedophilia entertaining ! A rape of a nine-year-old???? Seriously?? Nor is reading of severe physical abuse entertaining.  I was misled by the description of the plot...an adult medical doctor in search of her missing sister.  I stayed with it until the end because I kept looking for some redeeming shred. I will never gift someone a book ever again that I've not read myself !!  My friend is going through a difficult emotional time with dialysis and has always wanted a sister.

"The plot of THE CHILL: A NOVEL sounds promising--it’s about a huge reservoir that is haunted by the remnants of Galesburg, a community that was drowned when the reservoir’s dam was built to deliver water to downstate New York.  Unfortunately, the novel is almost unreadable.  Whatever story exists is buried under the sheer weight of words expended to establish an ominous atmosphere by describing minute details of a dilapidated cabin, underground NYC sewers, the reservoir’s cold currents, etc.<br /><br />By the end of Part One (about 100 of 435 pages), almost nothing has happened.  A grandmother who once lived in Galesburg “goes home” by drowning herself in the reservoir, using weighted and padlocked chains.  A New York City sewer worker starts seeing Galesburg-related hallucinations in the nearly complete water tunnel he is building.  A local sheriff kicks his drug-addicted son out of his home, telling the son he is no longer fit enough to swim the reservoir.  The son goes swimming in the reservoir, and hallucinates killing a dam inspector who has just discovered a condition that will lead to the dam’s failure.  The sewer worker’s daughter (and granddaughter of the drowned grandmother) arrives to investigate the son’s story, and realizes something is horribly wrong when the son mentions the name of a photographer who might have witnessed the killing.<br /><br />At this point, I gave up.  It’s clear that something very bad is going to happen at the reservoir, but I don’t care.  The characters aren’t memorable or well developed, and the puzzle of how Galesburg is going to get its revenge is only mildly interesting.  I certainly don’t want to read another 300 pages of overly descriptive prose to find out what happens next in the very thin overall story.",negative

I just didn't find the start interesting, and quickly and quietly removed the book from my Kindle.<br /><br />It might have gotten better if I hung on, but in this case, I wasn't willing to try again.",negative
"Twelve-year-old Catherine's autistic younger brother David is a constant source of embarrassment for her, from his hand flapping and public tantrums to socially inappropriate behaviors such as dropping his pants in public. Catherine is constantly updating her list of rules for David in order to spare him (and herself) embarrassment at the hands of others. Many of these rules make perfect sense to the non-autistic: knock before entering the bathroom, no toys in the fish tank, chew with your mouth closed.<br /><br />Catherine's best friend is away for the summer, and she's overjoyed when a new girl her age moves in next door, but she's afraid that David will mess everything up. She also meets Jason, a nonverbal wheelchair user who attends the same therapy clinic as David, and the two strike up a deep friendship, with the artistic Catherine going as far as to create new picture cards for Jason's communication book. Jason teaches her important lessons about acceptance and true friendship.<br /><br />Lord has created a particularly realistic novel that looks at handicaps and public perception, siblings, and the perils of preteen social angst in a down-to-earth voice. Catherine's family has its flaws as well as its warm moments, and David is a funny, adoring younger brother even though many of his actions are mysterious and frustrating to Catherine. Catherine's budding friendship with Jason was also tenderly drawn, and I hope that Catherine and the other characters will reappear in later novels.",positive
"THE REVOLVING DOOR OF LIFE is my first &#34;44 Scotland Street&#34; novel, and the 10th novel in the series.  It's enjoyable as a standalone, because of Alexander McCall Smith's amazing skill at showcasing the foibles of ordinary people in a lighthearted way.<br /><br />How can a reader NOT laugh at a serious first-grade classroom discussion about whether one child's mother--who is &#34;a cow&#34; according to another child's father--got her &#34;cowness&#34; from the first child's maternal or paternal grandmother?  Alexander McCall Smith possesses a truly unique way of looking at life that always makes me smile.<br /><br />However, I found it hard to get into this novel, because of my unfamiliarity with the basic Scotland Street setting (Edinburgh's New Town) and the myriad characters (Matthew, Elspeth, Pat, Irene, Domenica, Angus, Bertie, Olive, etc.).  Because I much prefer the author's &#34;#1 Ladies Detective Agency&#34; series, and was not inspired to go back and read the earlier &#34;44 Scotland Street&#34; novels, I rate THE REVOLVING DOOR OF LIFE at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",positive

"Danny delivers the true Chicago story, as he lived it, in this hard-hitting, but also incredibly warm & humor-filled memoir.  He's as tough on himself as he is on his former band-mates.

As Chicago membership has become something of a revolving door in recent years (PBS's recent Chicago II Live in Concert looked for all the world like Robert Lamm, James Pankow & Lee Loughnane playing with a tribute band), bringing Danny Seraphine and his great personality & drumming skills back into the fold might go a long way toward making it all seem real again.

There's a serial killer on the loose and the fortune teller starts seeing images of the victims. The characters were interesting, but most of them were not likeable. I wasn't satisfied with the ending, though it does seem to wrap things up for the most part.",positive
"This might have been much too low level for our family.  We love to collect Spanish language books and we have found that it is the absolute best way to increase vocabulary, but this book might have been far to young for us.  It is very, very basic with colors and shapes and perhaps more suitable as a toddler coloring book.  I'm sure it is perfect in the right hands but unfortunately not the right fit for us.",positive
"This book was disappointing and a real struggle to finish.  It starts out really slow.  Once you get past the first half of the book and the pace picks up, then it is a bunch of friends turning on one another while caught in a web of lies only to find out it was the parents all along that had been keeping secrets and telling lies.  Then, at the end there was a nice little BBQ to help everyone make up and be friends.  I found it to be a frustrating and disturbing book.  I also have to admit that I am a conservative mom and maybe some parents are okay with the adult topics being thrown at their kids like molestation and sex among young teens, but this just didn't work for me.  I definitely wouldn't want my young teenager to read this book.  There are so many better books out there.  Skip this one!",negative
"I purchased this cookbook for my niece who is a huge Tolkien fan.  It is a hardcover and is beautifully illustrated along with very edible and doable recipes.

I am not a huge Tolkien fan, but love to collect cookbooks and I love this one!",positive
"In Alex Flinn's ""Beastly,"" we're treated to a modern-day update of the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. Here, the spoiled prince is Kyle Kinsgbury, son of a famous newscaster in New York. Kyle is rich, handsome, and cruel, and delights in mocking less popular students, but one day he picks the wrong target: a witch disguised as a Goth. In punishment for his cruelty, he is transformed into a beast for two years. If he can find a girl who loves him in spite of his appearance, the spell is broken. If not, he's cursed to live as a beast forever.<br /><br />Flinn uses IM-style chats to introduce BeastNYC (Kyle) and other fairy tale characters that are trapped by spells: the frog prince, Little Mermaid and others. These chat room sequences really make the novel feel current before cutting away to the action.<br /><br />Kyle, who changes his name to Adrian after his transformation, gives up all hope of finding a girl who will love him, fur and all. His father ships him off to a separate isolated brownstone where he can't embarrass him. But fate (and the witch who cursed him) has a few tricks in store, and the once-arrogant Kyle undergoes a metamorphosis into the new sensitive, intelligent Adrian, who's actually interested in people's welfare.<br /><br />Tenderly told, with elements of action, romance and high school drama, ""Beastly"" is a worthy update to the genre and a fine counterpoint to other retellings such as [[ASIN:0689870051 Beast]] and [[ASIN:0060753102 Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast]].",positive

"I love the WunderKeys series.  I started with the preschool and continued into the kindergarten with my then 4 yr old student.  It was amazing how easy it was for him to understand and grasp the concepts.  Plus, he absolutely loved the games (with a few modifications). The games are a little tricky for someone so young so we simplified.  He loved them anyway and didn't know the difference and still grasped the concepts the games were teaching.  Each lesson is perfectly laid out and my little one rarely got bored, except for when he just would refuse to play ;)",positive

I am sorry to give a bad review (I actually wanted to return the book on the spot but I forgot and now I feel bad about doing it this late)...IF you never have time to look up recipes online (or if you just prefer printed stuff) then this book would be great for you...if you are friendly with cooking sites online this is a waste of your money...there is not one recipe here that I have not seen on different online sites for free.,negative

"I admire the idea and the causes that are represented but I really didn't like the poems. They seemed forced and contrived and not enjoyable at all. I kept thinking throughout the book, do I have to pretend I enjoy these poems?  Maybe the next one will be better. It wasn't.  I really didn't like the poems. Maybe they should have not focused so much on poem forms, and focus on poems that move the reader.",negative
"I read this cookbook from cover to cover. I love the introduction to pressure cooking as it describes how pressure cooking works, what ingredients go into mediterranean cooking, safety, what doesn't work well in the pressure cooker (like shrimp), etc.<br /><br />Of all the recipes, there is one that concerns me. The sausage bean soup has dried kidney beans in it. I was always told that kidney beans had to be soaked, then rinsed, and then cooked and rinsed again before fully cooking to keep them from being poisonous (more like to keep from getting an upset stomach). However, in this pressure cooker recipe, they are added dry so there is no rinsing out the toxins. Perhaps it is okay but there should be a mention that this is okay or acknowledge that kidney beans are toxic and that (perhaps) pressure cooking does away with these toxins.<br /><br />Nevertheless, most recipes sound great and use typical household ingredients. The only one I found that does not is the deconstructed lamb - stuffed cabbage recipe that requires a teaspoon of sumac.<br /><br />There is one recipe photo at the start of each chapter. There is a reference to which recipe it is a picture of. I decided to make the savory strata which is something I never heard of in my life. It did not look appetizing but it tasted great. Both my boyfriend and I loved the taste of the dish. (See photos of the various stages of development. I attached them in order but Amazon re-shuffles the photos, so they will be out of order.) It did take me longer to prep than the recipe stated but I find that is typical of all cookbooks--at least when I am preparing the food.<br /><br />In summary, I feel there are a lot of good to great recipes in this book. Note that almost any one of these recipes can be made on the stovetop too but for those who want to cook via pressure, this can be a great addition to their cookbook library. I know I consider this a good one to mine.",positive
"I'm sorry, I feel stupid, because everyone on the end pages went on and on about the amazing writing and how good a book this is, but I just absolutely did not get it and would not recommend it.  Too long, too dark, and I think probably trying to do too much.  I didn't like any of the characters, I didn't like the story, I didn't like the plot, I didn't like much of anything except the idea of what I think he was trying to do and I hope he did and apparently he did for many people, but not for me.",negative

"As a long-time F-22 Raptor fan I eagerly awaited the day when Squadron Signal Publications would come out with this book. The wait was worth it! This book doesn't disappoint. It is filled with 72 pages of awesome photographs and outstanding artwork. Of particular note is the artwork on the title page, a couple of seldom seen photographs of Northrop/McDonnell Douglas' YF-23 Black Widow II prototype, and of course, a wealth of great photographs of the star of the show - the F-22 Raptor - from the YF-22 and YF-23 demo/eval through recent deployments overseas. This book has something for everybody. Among my favorite F-22 Raptor photographs - the pictures of an F-22 and F-15 Strike Eagle in air-to-air maneuvers, the F-22 Demo Team Raptor in action, and the F-22 escorting a Russian Tu-95 Bear bomber flying near the Alaskan NORAD Region airspace. The variety of photos and great artwork make this a ""Must Have"" for F-22 Raptor enthusiasts and model airplane hobbyists!",positive

"Overall a good book to help Instructors, Faculty and new Instructional Technologist with limited to mid-level Moodle Knowledge.<br />Pictures are represent what you expect to see in Moodle from a faculty member's perspective to allow you to build your course and get it up online ready to go.<br />Chapter 1 - Developing an effective Online Course<br />  -- Provides some reasoning on why and how regarding Moodle and teaching. It could provide Instructional Designers a reference to provide faculty who are questioning the process and over all course design.<br /><br />The book covers a wide variety of areas to assist the course development process and more importantly how you will then use the course to teach effectively to students. It doesn't get to far into the weeds so if you need that level of fidelity then this isn't the best book for you (Experienced Moodle users moving from 2.x to 3.x version).  Additionally, if you're experienced the beginning of each chapter on a bit of instructional design/pedagogy  might put you off. I personally like the reminders as an Faculty Developer and Educational Technologist. Sometimes you just need to review the how and why to get better.<br /><br />I like how the author has gotten into Workshops and Portfolios, two the least used modules I've seen implemented by faculty at 3 decent sized institutions. She provides explanations on why and how to use these sections to get most every one started and follow ups with examples on how to use them to further the learner's engagement<br /><br />It's a good starter book for Moodle course design and implementation. Don't count on reading cover to cover in a day or so. But each chapter allows the reader the ability to jump to an area you need assistance with.",positive
Well written book.,positive
"My Sister Sif by Ruth Park ([[ASIN:1903015111 Playing Beatie Bow]]) tells the tale of Rikoriko and her sister Sif. Orphaned after their father died, the girls are sent to live with their aunt in Australia. After growing up on the tropical paradise of Rongo, their new home Sydney, with its mad rush and choking pollution, is absolute torture, and Riko (known as Erika in the city) hatches a plot to escape.<br /><br />Riko's idyllic summer on Rongo turns sour with the arrival of an American scientist, Henry Jacka, who's falling in love with Sif. Riko is bitter and upset, lashing out at those closest to her. She escapes up into the hills to vent to her friend Pig, a ground-dwelling Stone Age dwarf with an intense fear of fire.<br /><br />The book inserts a dizzying blend of science fiction (telepathy, space age materials, mermaids, dwarves) and heavy-handed environmental warnings (mankind will destroy the earth!) into a relatively slim story; the main focus is on Riko's intense jealousy of Henry attempting to take Sif away from her. The climax felt forced and the sacrifice trivial; the ending fared better. This was originally written in 1986, and its age clearly shows in the descriptions of the ""near future"": rather than space-age technology, we get environmental disasters such as underwater dead zones, active volcanoes, tornadoes and floods, resulting in the death of butterflies (not quite yet!) and bees (much closer to reality). It's still an engaging read, especially for fans of mermaid- and dolphin-centered novels such as [[ASIN:0312379358 A Ring of Endless Light: The Austin Family Chronicles, Book 4]] and [[ASIN:0763640603 Emily Windsnap: Three Swishy Mermaid Tales: Books 1-3]], but is much more serious in tone than other books in this genre.",positive
"Ever felt like there's a nagging voice in your head? Well, if you're Penelope Thornton-McClure, that ""voice"" is the very dead private dick Jack Shepard, who hasn't had a body since getting iced in 1949. Jack haunts Pen's bookstore Buy the Book and aids her in solving mysteries; in The Ghost and the Femme Fatale, the small town of Quindicott has its hands full with its first-ever Film Noir festival. Leading lady Hedda Geist, out of the limelight for decades after the grisly death of her studio boss Irving Vreen, is scheduled to make an appearance, but her first return to the stage is nearly her last.<br /><br />Penelope, her aunt, and Jack are hot on the trail when festival guests turn up dead, leading them to uncover a decades-old tale of steamy affairs and cold-blooded murder. Snappy pacing, humor, and even a touch of romance between the hard-boiled Jack with his ""iron jaw"" and Penelope (the two ""time travel"" through dreams in order to investigate). Jack's language is pure pulp fiction / noir, and the touches from the 1940s were nice. This is the same author who pens the Coffeehouse Mysteries, and I loved the take-charge Pen, the sexy Jack, and the quirky cast of supporting characters. The mystery included enough twists and turns that I didn't even suspect the real villain until the shocking (and appropriately noirish) finale. This was the first book in the series that I read (it's number four), and I can't wait to devour the further adventures of Jack and Pen (I'd like to see their romance heat up!).",positive

"Wow.  You follow a friend, Helen, who accepts the responsibility of taking care of a friend, Nicola, for three weeks who has cancer and plans to undergo an alternative treatment.<br /><br />In such a small book, the author delivered the biggest punch of one of life's toughest moments: taking care of someone who is ill.  The story is delivered in a fast pace, but dont be deceived by the small volume of the book; the emotional roller coaster ride is just as real and renching for loved ones and as well as the one who is ill.<br /><br />For those who are/have been caretakers, the story is all too familiar.  For the person who is ill, the reference to denial and alternative medicines is all to real in keeping the hope alive for a miracle cure.<br /><br />A lovely book that provides an insight into one of life's toughest experiences; but told with love, wit, family and friendship.  Sometimes, you have to reach to the most unlikley people who will help you through the toughest times in life: it may not always be found in the traditional family!  I found myself unable to put the book down as the author very quickly pulled me into these character's lives.",positive
"Part mystery story, part inspired classic novel, interspersed narrative poem on life and love, infused with current themes made universal through come-to-life battles between 18th-centtury Puritans and Druid priestesses, Kaplan-Maxfield has penned a fascinating and beautifully complex oeuvre. For the literary, it's full of metaphorically rich prose flowing polished from his pen. For the young, it's a gothic mystery about love and longing and the quest to unravel life's mysteries while learning about love, ancestral teachings, power, and sacred truths--told through the eyes of modern-day Nikki and her ancestral mother Anne. For those not so young, it gifts the exciting rhythm of youth tempered by wisdom perhaps not yet acquired. It is also a tightly crafted contemporary novel with captivating depth about olden ways full of lessons for modern morass. Arcing through post-stormy-passages poetic rainbows reveal insights about men and women, science and religion, sacredness and truth, and learning to live with the constraints we are dealt.",positive
"As a serious Tolkien fan, I figured this would be interesting.  Sadly, it isn't.

For example, I was only able to see a couple of the angels in the piece “Lamentation the mourning of Christ.”  I was familiar with this piece, but wonder how many of the artwork was partially shown.  This was disappointing to me.  I also found some of the writings not only lacking, but partly false.  In one, the author mentions “There were no mirrors in those days, so people had little or no idea what their own face looked like.”  Had they never seen themselves in a water reflection?  Overall, was this book worth it, I don’t think so.",negative

"This is the third Audrey Harte mystery (the first is [[ASIN:0316302503 It takes One]]).  It works fine as a standalone, with just the right amount of teaser backstory that doesn't give away the earlier plots.  Harte is certainly an oddball heroine--a licensed psychologist specializing in troubled teenagers, who is also a convicted murderer!  The murderer part is okay, though, because her hometown (Edgeport, Maine) has lots of murderers who haven't been caught (a dysfunctional small town?); and Harte’s murder was a “good” murder.  Her victim (Clint) was an evil man.<br /><br />In the novel, Harte sets out to solve a domestic mystery--who is the biological father of Mackenzie Bell, the daughter of Harte’s now-deceased former best friend Maggie?  Maggie was sexually abused by her father Clint, and as a troubled teen, she slept around.  Mackenzie, when she learns who the Edgeport possibilities are, has second thoughts about the project to find out “where she came from”.  Edgeport is an inbred backwater of a town.<br /><br />But there's more to the story than a paternity search.  Harte’s beloved Jake is threatened by a pair of blackmailers (can’t you trust a hired hit man to take your money and be done with it?).  Both end up murdered, though it's clear that Jake didn't do them, because he wouldn't have left any mess.  The killers’ identities are ultimately revealed in a last-minute surprise ending.<br /><br />This is almost a “cozy” mystery, because it's leisurely paced, and mostly focused on people and relationships.  But it's also a decent PI procedural.  I enjoyed it, but am not sure that I want to read any more “Audrey Harte” series books.  I liked Jake a lot, but didn't care much for Harte, even though she is an independent professional woman with believable investigative skills.",positive

I turned my face to the wet pillow and sailed a salty river into the caverns of grief remembered, into the subterranean depths of sleep.&#34;<br /><br />I feel like I've just sailed into that cavern of grief remembered myself---the grief I imposed on myself by reading this amateurish drivel. Someone call the adjective police. Unless you are stuck with both a seventh grade intellect and emotional developmental level and have a fetish for severe overwriting, you'd best skip this one. This is one of those extremely rare instances where the TV series is better than the books. A mature viewing audience would NEVER stand for such juvenile and cliché characters, not would they tolerate the unfocused, rambling storyline. This is basically a Harlequin romance painfully stretched into a series. The most entertaining part of the deal for me is speculating on who these people are that give it five stars and how abysmally low their expectations in a book must be.

"Many reviewers have pointed out the geographical and historical inaccuracies, and I agree with all of them.  Most of the biographical information is superficial . I don't understand how a book of such low quality is published.  The writing is also poor.  When making a point about the sexual culture of the time, the author tells us they talked and wrote about sex but weren't necessarily having that much.  Then she compares this to today, where sex saturates our media but ""teenage pregnancies are lower""-- she means today's teenagers aren't having much sex either.  (I could list five reasons why pregnancies are lower having nothing to do with sexual activity).  I say this as an example of the thoughtless approach to much of this historical material.

"I found this story on the Recommended Bar of the Amazon page for the Michael Cole books I read. I wish I could give glowing praise for this book, but I can't. I've read a great deal of true-crime non-fiction as I earned my Criminal Justice degree. I've read just as many horror and police procedural fiction featuring serial killers / human monsters. This book tried too hard to be everything. A set location with several people, an escaped serial killer, picking up a hitchhiker outside of a prison (never the smartest move), and a bunch of different hockey masks.  A bubbling lake burping out rotten gaseous fumes killing fish and changing the color of the surrounding flora & fauna.<br /><br />There are a several large killer species that make appearances and a superman that defies all logic. Sadistic behavior. Vile acts by a depraved killer. Gruesome results from a sick individual. These books are escapism fiction for me, but this was even too farfetched for me. I'm not sure if I want to chance reading another book by this author. Sometimes though one book is not all that good, but the author gets better over time. Maybe in several months or a couple years there will be a book by Generous that makes me want to read it.",negative
Just Haven't Met You Yet is a refreshing and amusing book. The main plot was not worn and used. I was completely caught off guard with some of the turns it made.

She has a dysfunctional relationship with her mother. The relationship she has with her best friend is a little odd, but sweet. One of the subplots of the book involved some sexual misconduct which is very timely right now. I almost felt like it was written as a result of what's going on in the world right now, but it's merely a coincidence.

Possibly the most disappointing cookbook I've ever seen. Some of these recipes aren't even recipes.,negative
I am a Greg Isles fan.  I've read 5 of his other books and loved them.  I was unprepared for the supernatural/science fiction element to this book.  Good characters.  I really like his writing style but the premise of this book was just too far-fetched and quite raunchy.,negative
How many times can you write about your chracters ordering bad coffee?  Not one character felt real and the premise of the story left me cold. Save your time and money.,negative
"As a fan of the ABC Family show &#34;The Fosters,&#34; which is about a family made up primarily of foster children and which deals sensitively and realistically with some of the issues they face, I was eager to read this book.  &#34;Returnable Girl&#34; is narrated by Ronnie (Veronica), a teenager who has lived in nine foster homes in five years, always being &#34;returned&#34; to the foster care system for one reason or another.  As the book opens, she is finally in a stable and loving place, but that does not mean her problems are over--far from it.<br /><br />The book is written in the form of journal entries.  As Ronnie navigates her new home, school, friends, church, and so on, we see both her issues as a teen and her complicating issues as a foster child.  We learn of her past--absent dad, utterly irresponsible mom, cold and unfeeling relatives--and we travel with her the ups and downs of modern teen culture.  Ronnie has had a hard life, and she is not the easiest person to deal with.  She is not above cruelty herself, especially with respect to her unfortunate friend Cat.  Her past has left its scars, yet Ronnie is an appealing character, and I think the teenage girl audience for whom this book is aimed will love it.<br /><br />My only issue with the book is the voice of the teens themselves.  It seems not quite right to me.  It seems more like the way the kids on &#34;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&#34; talked.  It just misses being authentic.  Perhaps I am too critical, but I just read Chris Bohjalian's &#34;Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands,&#34; and the voice of that teenage narrator is utterly right.  But maybe this is something only an adult would notice.<br /><br />In any event, &#34;Returnable Girl&#34; would have been a five-star book but for the issue of voice.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in foster children and the problems they face, often from the very agencies that are trying to help them.",positive

"I have an electric grill and wanted to read about some grilling techniques. This is good but the recipes are either for gas or the charcoal grill. Nevertheless, the gas grill recipes seem to work with electric just fine.<br /><br />The first 47 pages cover grilling basics, gas and charcoal grills,  harnessing heat, how to read a recipe, essential techniques, etc. Page 11 is the only page that mentioned other grills such as ceramic and electric ones.<br /><br />After reading the book cover to cover, I found 11 recipes that I would make. I decided to make the ""Herb Stuffed Turkey Burgers"" and added in the bacon that the recipe note said would ""take it to the next level."" The end result was delicious. I had to grill this on my electric grill because I do not have gas or charcoal. It came out fine as can be seen in my photo.<br /><br />In summary, I think this is a very good grilling book to learn the basics of grilling. I do wish he mentioned that the recipes can be followed with any type grill -- perhaps with minor modifications. Also, I would have liked some recipe photos.",positive
"This book is intended for classroom use. I am a homeschool mom, and don't use it as intended. This book is reproducible for your classroom. There are 40 weekly pages- 1 page per week, front and back. This is a good reminder for Language Arts. It is NOT a language arts curriculum. It doesn't teach the ideas, simply asks the questions. I think kids might struggle at the beginning of first grade with the questions. I don't know many fresh first graders who can write a journal entry. However, they could narrate the answers. But doing it independently would be quite a stretch. In general, I think this is a little higher than first grade level. There is a fluency check at the beginning of each week. I'm not going to put a 6 year old through that, as they are such new readers, I'm just happy they can read any words and am not concerned with how many words per minute they can manage. I like the higher grades better. This system seems to work better for grade 3 and up. But the first grade set isn't too very far off.",positive

"I had a chance to read this to my four-year-old twin granddchildren (boy and girl) and they and I were disappointed.

"Meh. That's all the emotion I can muster for this book. It's erotica that opens with a scene involving a baby and parents who've escaped some sort of culty sex thing. I was not really feeling a connection to any of these three people at all. That continued throughout the book - Aurelia just seemed excessively passive and that drives me nuts.<br /><br />There's a hint of magic in this with tattoos that appear out of nowhere in response to the sexual &#34;training&#34;. Additionally, the story hops from past to present to way back in the past and was distracting. This book is part of an ongoing series - it's not one that I will bother with though. I don't mind erotica, but it needs to make sense and I have to connect with the characters - and slaves aren't my thing.",negative
"i am a big fan of Amy Tan's writing and i always learn little bit about humanity with its deep pain and the rise of the spirit, and Chinese culture.  The setting of this book is 1910's and into 1926: based on the main character, Violet and all her variations as her life changed from one form to another: always seeking to be loved and something she may not know she would be seeking.  I think this was a challenging/ambitious concept to get across in the book that towards the end, the details were pushed through little too fast or I didn't get the depth of betrayal that I thought might have been there.  If you love Amy Tan then you will read this book, but it is not one of her best in terms of getting my heart string pulled!  [it will probably make a great movie as there are so many angles and 'lives' that the main character had in the short span of her life!  I still had a great read and learnt a lot about women's life (for the not so rich class or if your life took a few bad turns and what they had to put up with) .. Amy Tan still delivered a great novel of immense detail about life in china and the courtesan world - very intriguing.",positive

It costs $179.95 to buy the Pro Deluxe Coiling Gizmo! The simple, cheap Coiling Gizmo can't make long enough coils to make this bracelet. Should I add that LeRoy Goertz, the inventor of the Coiling Gizmo, designed the Simple Coiled Bracelet pattern?<br /><br />Forget this book, there are a lot better jewelry making books out there.",negative

"""Auto Biography"" is a non-fiction biography about a 1957 Chevy Four-Door Wagon VIN# VB57B239191, the cast of characters that owned the Chevy, and those that work diligently to restore it. Earl Swift has an amazing knack of being able to intertwine each person's story with the history of the car and its 13 previous owners prior to it ending up in the hands of Tommy Arney, owner of Moyock Muscle.<br /><br />Tommy Arney is a foul-mouth and shady character himself but is definitely not all bad.  In fact, because the author keeps things real, the story has immense integrity.  Those who restore antique cars will understand the painstaking attention to detail concerning this car's restoration that is described within.  Although I do not restore antique cars, I love attending car shows and gawking at the gleaming paint jobs and pristine interiors their owners labored intensively to produce. Just as I think of my car almost like a person, those who restore old cars feel the same way.  This story should appeal to those readers and those who want to learn about the history of a car's previous owners.<br /><br />I would have liked to see before, during, and after restoration color photographs of the Chevy in the centerfold; however, no pictures were in this  pre-release copy nor does it appear that pictures will be included.  Other than the lack of photos, I found this a great read.  I loved the story which took the author nine years of research to produce.<br /><br />WARNING: This text is not PG-13 as there are a lot of ""F"" words and cussing in the book.",positive

"Don't buy this book. I have no clue who these other people are who are rating it. Anyone with a blank piece of paper who can draw a square will find it insulting to have been suckered into this thing. I'll enclose some photos for you. It has a FEW pages that suggest supplies needed to tangling, one page donated to &quot;introduction to tangling&quot;. Most of the book are blank pages with just frames to draw in (like you can't just use your own paper). It's not a child's book either. There are two pages of something called &quot;Fibonacci spiral&quot; a mathematics thing even I, a college grad, don't understand and another page called &quot;the golden ratio&quot; from the authors perspective as a photographer (it's a math thing, I'll take a pic). Nothing is explained well and of 149 pages only 21 have any writing. The adorable little animals are all on the back cover, only one is inside .  I've learned nothing (except I must not remember the math I took because it's really not something I was taught).

"Daniel X, alien hunter extraordinaire, is trying to save the planet and kill the aliens responsible for his parent's death. Daniel's super power is that he has the ability to use his imagination to create fellow alien hunters, a family, and some cool weapons, all while managing to get himself out of some seriously dangerous situations. Unfortunately, it appears that the same aliens that killed his parents are also trying to take over the world through the use of technology. The evil alien (who is constantly described as resembling a giant catfish) has released his henchmen on the town, and is determined to kill all humans for the sake of ""entertainment"". No one seems immune to the evil ones plans. He's forced people to dance to 80s music, and impregnated several of women in the town thru contaminated caviar (and they are eating fish food by the ""buggy full""), and is leaving tons of dead humans in his wake. And half way through the story, you find yourself wondering just how will Daniel save the world, if he is having trouble saving himself?<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with this book. To be honest I expected a lot more, or at least a story that was cohesive. I know....I know, I am constantly complaining about my declining appreciation for Patterson, and yet continue to read and review them. I guess what was a promising tale, ended up being somewhat disjointed and mediocre. And while Patterson may have been implying that society has become too dependant on technology (since that was the evil one's method to infiltrate society), and need to get back to reading books, this was not an example of a good read. And although it was a promising premise, the real question remains would I read another Daniel X book? Probably not unless someone can assure me that it would be worth the time and effort.",negative

"This is a suspenseful story. It's about a young woman who has been dealing with a lifetime of nightmares. She gets married and then the day after the wedding she's in an accident. From then, the story is told in different point of views - the husband, the young woman as a child, her mother, and her father. The story is finding the truth behind the nightmares. It deals with some mental disorders, possibly bipolar, that makes it a little difficult to know what's true and what's not. I read the book in just about a day. It was very quick paced. I did feel that the author used way too many parentheses in the story. I get that it's a literary device, but it was overused in the book and I found it to be very annoying after a while.",positive

"This book is very very psychological with lots of psychological terms.  Another review mentioned how religious this book was.  For me, this book is not religious at all.  Sure there are quotes from the Bible in it, but there are more quotes from other sources as well...the beatles, Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Simon and Garfunkel, etc.  So the authors get their inspiration from all kinds of literary works.  I would say most of the advice in the book comes from pop psychology and is not at all Biblical.<br /><br />While it is nice to know that what you are going through is something others are dealing with as well.  There is little by way of &#34;help&#34; in this book.  I was really looking forward to the chapter on Getting and Keeping the Attention of the Health-Care System.  This chapter had very little helpful advice.  It was more about the doctor's perspective...which is fine...but not too helpful to me.<br /><br />I forced myself to read this book in it's entirety, but found that I would have benefited from a different book more than this one.",negative
"In This Dame for Hire, Faye Quick becomes an ersatz private eye when all able-bodied men have been drafted by Uncle Sam. 1943 New York can be a rough place: Claudette West, a student at NYU, is brutally murdered on a cold, snowy night, and Faye is the one who literally stumbles across her body.<br /><br />Filling in for her boss Woody Mason, Faye and her trusty secretary Birdie are hot on the trail of Claudette's killer, but the case quickly becomes more than the open-and-shut case expected. Claudette was having affairs with a number of men, including a lecherous literature professor, a sinister, controlling actor with a disreputable side profession, and other, more shadowy suspects. Claudette's upper-crust family insists that Claudette's most recent boyfriend, Richard Cotten, killed her in order to grab a share of her family's money, but the evidence (and Faye's gut instinct) leads her elsewhere across the city.<br /><br />Faye's WWII New York is filled with popular WWII standards, automats, and vintage slang that really give life to the setting. The supporting cast includes a group of gamblers, Faye's spunky Yiddish-spouting neighbor Dolores, with her crazy outfits and changing wigs, and Anne the psychic. She also strikes up a relationship with the handsome detective Johnny Lake, and the two share information on the case.<br /><br />There are several delicious twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. The numerous red herrings add to the sense of mystery as Faye tracks down every possible lead, only to find that most of her tips fizzle out, and that the father of the murdered girl is trying to sabotage her investigation by trailing her and reinterrogating her suspects.<br /><br />A delightful read that felt right at home with a strong cup o' joe and some Frankie tunes on the radio, This Dame for Hire will delight fans of film noir and WWII pop culture.",positive

"I really liked how well the characters were flushed out in this book.  The story is pretty tried and true and as old as civilisation, but well told.  The setting was pretty much now with a quarter cup of magic and witchcraft.  There were familiars and spells and magick schools, but the magik always kept in the background and actually could be lifted out with no change to the story.  The artwork is fresh and fun, although not flattering for the main character. The pages flew by.  A great novel of finding yourself in the world of newly adult relationships.",positive

"In KNIT VINTAGE, well-known designers Madeline Weston and Rita Taylor present more than 20 classic knitwear designs, updated for modern tastes from designs originally published in the 1930's, 1940's, and 1950's.  Most of the designs are for body-hugging tops, like the one in the cover photo, but there are also designs for a ""Wallis Simpson"" cardigan, a Tyrolean-flower-patterned cardigan (intarsia), and some very pretty cabled and lacy twinsets.  All of the designs have a definite ""vintage"" look--and you probably won't want to knit them unless you have a taste for ""retro"" clothing.<br /><br />The full-color knitwear photographs by Debi Treloar are beautiful, and the written-out instructions seem to be clear (as I would expect from Weston and Taylor).  Nearly all of the designs (sweaters, stockings, skirt and top, beret) are knit in fine yarns, on 3mm to 4.5mm needles (US 2 to US 7), in gauges of 6 to 8 stitches to the inch.  This means a lot of knitting, especially for the twinsets!  You will probably need at least intermediate knitting skills to knit the body-hugging designs, because they have a lot of shaped increases.  Because of the limited appeal of this pattern collection, I rate KNIT VINTAGE at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",positive
"This was not Horror/Supernatural. Not a Mystery novel and not a thriller. At best it read like mediocre fan fiction - a blending of William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist meets 21st century blogging. Dull writing, wooden characters, weak dialogue. Slow pacing, nothing of interest that I’ll remember.  I didn’t care about any of the characters at all.

"My all-time best friend of some 50 years gave me the book (autographed by Steve) as a birthday gift.  And much appreciated it was, too.  But sometimes we can learn too much about our pop culture icons.  What's the old adage, ""Kill Your Idols?""  Still, I'm forever grateful to Mr. Van Zandt for accomplishing the impossible by bringing the original Rascals together once again (miraculous!) about 10 years ago for the wonderful ""Once Upon a Dream"" concert / show.  It was one of the greatest Broadway experiences of my life, no kidding!  The fact that the guys ultimately blew the reunion tour and scattered off once again into the winds of rock 'n' roll time was a major disappointment.  However, reading Steven's recollections about their pettiness and backstabbing ways (with the exception of Eddie Brigati, the truest of the boys to the Rascals' peace, love & brotherhood ideals) really broke my lifelong Rascals fan heart.  For me, it was the truest and most emotional segment of the entire memoir.  The rest?  Well, sometimes a great second banana should simply remain a great second banana rather than blather on and come across as a raging egotist.  Reminds me of the late, great Beach Boy Dennis Wilson quote, ""Had it not been for my brother Brian, Mike Love would still be pumping gas for a living.""  Substitute Bruce for Brian and Stevie for Mike and you'll catch my drift.  Disappointing, and ultimately sad.",negative

"While the Amazon title doesn't promise this, the cover of the book says these are reusable stickers.<br /><br />Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store because I suggested another reusable sticker book (our son loves the Melissa and Doug Reusable Sticker Book). These stickers are only reusable in the sense that they don't stick well the first time, so you can pull them up and relay them once or twice more. After that, they loose all stickiness.<br /><br />So beyond the fact that it isn't reusable at all, I also feel like she got ripped off. Had there been more stickers maybe it wouldn't have been so bad But $6 for 75 non-sticky stickers feels like a waste of money to me. There are only 4 pages of stickers and about 6 scenes.<br /><br />Go for any one of the M&D versions, it's the same price.<br /><br />If you're looking for just stickers, I would recommend the ""THOMAS' STICKER EXPRESS (Thomas & Friends) (Super Stickerific) [Paperback]"" with over 700 stickers!  Slightly more expensive, but totally worth it.  Hopefully your kid is a train lover.

"Bern and Melvin met in Philadelphia in the early 1960s and fell in love, but things go seriously awry and they must flee the United States, chased by an FBI agent as they head to Ghana where Mel's old college roommate is now President Nkrumah.  Twisted into this adventure is the reality that Nkrumah's power is against the USA's political interests as he has aligned with the Russians. A coup is in the works. Further twisted into this adventure are some mystical scenes surrounding Bern's heritage that is somehow tied in with mermaids and water; Melvin and Bert joining with a famous musician who has also had a key encounter related to water and a mermaid; and their journey, with the band,  toward President Nkrumah during chaotic and dangerous times and chaotic and dangerous weather.<br /><br />Bazawuie crafts a compelling tale and plays the mystical parts just right.  I did not find myself liking any of the characters at all.  Yet the characters were compelling. Bern is the least unlikeable and presents a strong independent female persona who is most interesting as a child when her grand ma dies.  It is rather unclear what she ever saw in Melvin, who is sympathetic in some ways but also seems to be a mess from the start.  Oddly, the FBI agent chasing Bern and Melvin is someone you -- don't necessarily root for -- but you take an interest in how he will make out.  While there is humor in this novel, there is also violence and pain.  I would say my primary emotional reaction to it was mild depression.  Interesting. Worth reading. Really well told/written.

This book COULD HAVE been half way decent but I think Andi did a disservice to herself with how she wrote it. She's constantly cursing and talking negatively about other people. I feel like it was just one big rant book and there's no way it could all even be true - how on earth would she remember every possible detail? Not only does she make herself look bad but I also thing she exaggerates on her life in NYC. And this is no way a dag to Andi but I think just the way she wrote the book makes her come across as someone who thinks she's better than other people, is caught up in the somewhat fame she has, and is just overall a negative person.

However, this is a self-help book about accepting yourself and moving forward positively and without fear instead of striving for perfection.<br /><br />This text went from a 3-star book to a 5-star book as the story progressed. The first couple of chapters were about the author telling the reader that she was a perfectionist and that the text that follows will allow the reader to be detoxed from perfectionism. I thought I was reading an infomercial and kept hoping the author would keep her promise.  Eventually, she did.<br /><br />Once I got into this book, I loved it. She provides wonderful insights on how we can embrace our imperfect self and provides daily detox methods at the end of each chapter that we can work on. There were many quotes in the book that resonated with me and here are two of them.<br /><br />1 - Acceptance is not about ignoring our weaknesses, but instead requires a shift in how we react to our imperfections and mistakes.<br /><br />2 - She reiterates a quote from a therapist she knows, &#34;Forgiveness is not letting people off the hook (including yourself) for doing unforgivable things, but it is about unhooking yourself from the negative actions of the past so they do not affect your positive future.&#34;<br /><br />There are many excellent points in the chapters of this book. Self-acceptance is about balancing your strengths and doubts--be curious, be free from fear, live in the moment, focus on the positives, exercise for fun not for the scale, etc. etc.<br /><br />Overall, the is an enjoyable read once the reader gets a few chapters in.",positive
I liked the message of this book although I must say it was lost on a 6 yr old. I did keep reading it to her so hopefully it sunk in. The only problem with the coloring book was how very few pages were in it. I don't think it was worth the money. She was finished with it very quickly.,positive
"I should have loved this story. It had everything that should have made this a riveting read. There was a mystery, interesting characters and a twist. I shouldn’t have been able to put this book down, but I found that I did over and over again, and had to force myself to pick it up. So in an effort to be fair to the author, who I am sure put her heart and soul into this story, I will explain my rating by dividing this review into two portions: what I like and what I didn’t.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />*Plot potential. Basically Solemn is a young girl, living in a trailer park, who sees something she shouldn’t. She is a keeper of several secrets.<br />*Tons of imagery. Even the trailer park itself is symbolic of a sense of despair and isolation.<br />*Interesting characters. The story is told from various point of views. Among them the young girl, a police officer and a mother. You see the events through their eyes. Their perception of the events vary depending on their perspective and interests.<br />*There were undertones of various social issues (i.e., education, poverty, race, domestic violence, alcoholism and drug use) woven throughout the story.<br /><br />What I didn’t like (which explains my low rating):<br />*The story was hard to follow, and hard to read. It almost seemed like a collaboration between Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and Sapphire, with a little Octavia Butler thrown in for good measure. What should have worked in theory didn’t. Instead it seemed a little all over the place. Unfort<br />unately, instead of one cohesive story or collaboration, it meandered and skipped around. There were times that the writing was so wordy, that I got a little lost and confused in the story. I found myself skipping sections or re-reading sections which isn’t a good sign. Perhaps in the next few weeks, I will re-read this book and revisit my review. Otherwise, I give this story 2 stars.",negative
"This book was an essential study guide addition to the main text I used for my history class 1302. It wasn't too expensive and arrived in great condition. Returning it was easy because I got shipping labels to put on the inside and outside. Paper was not ripped, no huge stains covering text. I used this pretty intensely for my online history course and it was great. Ended up getting an A, and I give this book an A as well. I particularly loved the practice quizzes inside the book, helped a lot.",positive
"This is a memoir about Cerrotti's grandmother, Hana Dubova, a Holocaust survivor. What I really love about We Share the Same Sky is the degree to which Cerrotti had access to her grandmother's journals and even to some of the people/relatives of the people who helped Hana or journeyed with her. This is also a memoir about the ten years Cerotti spent organizing family records, having them translated and following Hana's footsteps from Czechoslovakia to Denmark to Sweden and ultimately the United States. It is a love story between Cerrotti and her future husband Sergio, a Polish man she knew from England and caught up with in her travels. We Share the Same Sky is a unique take for me on a Holocaust survival story, because the Nazis allowed Hana's group of fourteen to sixteen year old Czech Zionists to leave their occupied country and travel to Denmark where they were sponsored by various families, pending a planned move to Palestine. Hana was happily settled on a Danish farm and never did go to Israel. She eventually had to leave in an overloaded boat bound for Sweden when Denmark was no longer safe for Jews under its own Nazi occupation. This is ultimately a book about relationships--- Hana's and her lost family's relationship; Hana's and Rachel's relationship; each of their relationships with the Danish farm family that fostered Hana; the Swedish fisherman that rescued the boatload of exiles from Denmark; the famous rabbi who traveled on that boat and his descendants; Hana's not so great first marriage; and Rachel's and Sergio's relationship that led to marriage and sorrow. It is a rich and loving accounting, meticulously researched and beautifully written.",positive

"Pretty useless. This is not a real travel guide – – it's more like a pamphlet with a few generalizations about a few major features of the town.

"I am a former elementary school teacher. I currently work as a special ed paraprofessional. I thought these books would be nice to use with the special needs students in my classroom. There are 3 books plus one workbook. The books are very nice and similar to the ones used in the schools. I thought they were well written and full of interesting and colorful photos. The only specific comment about the books is that I was slightly disappointed in the &#34;What Makes a Family&#34; book. They did a great job of showing diverse families. There are several different racial and ethnic groups represented as families. However, I was disappointed that all of the families had a mom and a dad. I would have liked to have seen one with two moms or two dads or even one with a single parent situation. The workbook seemed well done. It would be great as a summer bridge material. I can't comment for sure on the age appropriateness of the workbook, but it seems to be okay.",positive

"What an unfortunate mess this book is. The story of these women is tremendous and they deserve so much better! They deserve to be respected, honored and their sacrifices of grace shared with similar dignity by an actual writer of talent. Ms. Koppel and her publisher should never have allowed this book to be released without heavy editing. There is simply no coherence or flow from one event to the next or even one year to the next. One chapter will tell a story of one wife and her personal struggle in the midst of a particular launch and mid paragraph the author is off talking about someone completely different. You think the two will be related somehow in a significant manner later in chapter...nope.<br /><br />It's as if this entire book was pieced together at the last second from random piecemeal notes and half baked ideas on the back of cocktail napkins. There's no passion or feeling for the women from the writer,  she's relaying facts and adding inane filler to make a quick buck was the feeling I had page after page. I wish desperately this had been written by Paula McLain (The Paris Wife and Circling the Sun)  instead. My reason for giving this two stars rather than just one is the included photographs - the photos are an excellent time capsule of America at a critical juncture of our history and the photos are the only thing that gives any semblance of order or timeline to this book.",negative

"""Dancer"" is one of the most engaging novels that I have ever had the pleasure to read. Kaleidoscopic in nature, various events of Rudolph Nureyev's life are told by family members, teachers, dance partners, and friends, and this constantly changing perspective helps keep the novel's momentum.<br />""Dancer"" begins in grim postwar Russia with the arrival of wounded soldiers, and young Rudolph wonders if his father will be arriving with them. He dances for the soldiers in the makeshift hospital, and eventually studies dance with an exiled former ballerina. Later he goes to Leningrad to continue his training, living with Yulia, a repressed translator trapped in an abusive, dead-end marriage. Rudolph is blossoming into adulthood, arrogant and mysterious, and it becomes clear to all that he will become a legend of ballet. To the shock of family and friends, he defects from the Soviet Union even as his fame grows, but secret agents continue to hound him, waiting for him to trip up so he can be sent to the hard labour camps or even sentenced to death. The rest of the novel chronicles his stormy love affair with Erik Bruhn, his journeys between London and Paris, his later friendship with gay hustler Victor Pareci and the downward spiral of drugs, unsafe sex, dance injuries, a risky return to the Soviet Union, and hints of his losing battle against AIDS.<br />The numerous narrators include Odile, Nureyev's French maid, Margot Fonteyn, Victor Pareci, a London shoemaker, Rudolph's sister Tamara, Yulia, and others. Somehow McCann manages to keep the individual threads of the story separate, yet interwoven enough to form a shimmering tapestry of passion, betrayal, dedication, and above all the dance itself, spanning four decades of Nureyev's life and his final return to visit his ailing mother and friends. Touching and vibrant, ""Dancer"" is a whirlwind ride into the mind and body of an exiled ballet genius who will never be forgotten.",positive

"I have read several James Patterson collaborations (i.e., The Quickie, Life Guard, Beach Road, Beach House, Honeymoon, etc), and would have to say that this was the absolute WORSE so far. Because of Atlanta traffic, I often select books on CD that I usually wouldn't read, but am willing to listen to. You've Been Warned fit the bill. However, that was a huge MISTAKE and I have been regretting it ever since (although it is only 3 CD's and I kept hoping that it would get better)!<br /><br />What started out as a decent (although not terribly original story), soon turned into a supernatural (?) thriller where the main character starts experiencing things that she can't explain. Kristin (nanny by day, photographer by trade)is having an illicit affair with her employer (Michael), and seems to be suffering from nightmares (of events to come or that have happened). Between seeing things that she can't explain, and guilty over the affair, Kristin stumbles thru the novel, either seeing dead people (who include her father, her pediatrician who molested her, a mean cop, and countless others) or having encounters with people who ""warn"" her (of what, we are never sure). The novel then continues to spin out of control with a lot of conversation about her camera (that takes odd photos), mysterious men (one with a ponytail), odd events (smelling burning flesh and having rashes), numerous cockroaches and other even unexplained events, with no real explanation, and when one is finally given...it really isn't and leaves the reader more confused than ever.<br /><br />After listening to several hours of the story, I am still not really sure what it is about. And because of the lack of cohesiveness in the story, I did not really have an interest in the outcome of the story or even the character, Kristin (who I never disliked, but never liked either...at times she was a bit dumb). And with that said, I would never recommend this story to anyone.",negative
"what should have been a fun read in a sci-fi fantasy series, by a well regarded experienced author, just left me feeling icky. The characters were icky and so were their actions. Will have to try another by this author.<br /><br />BOOK# 1 - KING OF SWORDS - Rigel has always known he is not quite human, but the only clue to his origin is the otherworldly bracelet he has worn since childhood. His search for his parentage leads him to the Starlands, where reality and fantasy have changed places. There he learns that he is a human-starborn cross, and his bracelet is the legendary magical amulet Saiph, which makes its wearer an unbeatable swordsman. Fighting off monsters, battling a gang of assassins seeking to kill him, Rigel finds honorable employment as a hero. He knows that he must die very soon if he remains in the Starlands, but he has fallen hopelessly in love with a princess and cannot abandon her.

"My husband is a type 2 diabetic and we wanted to explore the vegan diet option to help... First I will say that this cookbook has NO photos.  I am always a little disappointed by this, but seems like more and more cookbooks these days are photo-less.  :(  On the upside, there is a very good informational (in my opinion as a vegan newbee) forward in this book with useful info about substitutes and options... The recipes seem to be fairly straightforward (no culinary degree needed or super special equipment) and tasty.  I really love the chilled watermelon soup - it's more delicious than one might think. Wish the book had photos and a spiral back to help keep it open while in use, but even without that I think this cookbook is worth owning if you are interested in trying the vegan lifestyle.",positive

It seems like a very solid book on the subject but I have read most all of it before.  I think everyone should be aware of what is in here.

"What a fun book! I kept putting reading it off, but once I sat down and picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I read the book from start to finish in about a day. The story is set in France. I found the descriptions of the scenery to be charming. The heroine of the story, Manderly is smart, well spoken, and interesting.  Xavier, the romantic interest, is almost too perfect. He's handsome, rich, and mysterious. There's a lot of French in the dialogue. Although I appreciate that the author wasn't trying to be accurate, I found that since I don't know any French, I would skip over those parts a lot. Then sometimes I would have to back track because I missed something. I was thoroughly entertained by this romance and I will definitely check out other books by this author.",positive

"I am a fan of historic novels--many of them either medieval or renaissance mysteries, some other forms of historic novel.  This is one of the best series I've read yet, well-researched and so much more than just a 'murder mystery'.  They give a good appreciation of specific times and events during the later years of King Henry VIII's reign, provoking a desire to learn more about the times (even though I've read a lot about the Tudors in factual detail) -- such as a biography of Thomas Cromwell, whom I'd never thought to be interested in before, as well as the dissolution of the monasteries.  Henry, himself, is not painted in a sympathetic light in any of the novels, which I believe, for this period, is quite accurate.  As a young king, Henry was much more admirable, but became increasingly self-serving, avaricious and disinterested in his people beyond how they could contribute to his aspirations to conquer and his greed for luxury.",positive
"This book is really awful. It isn’t as cute or clever as the original. And the message comes across as super passive aggressive. Pretty sure all the positive reviews are grandparents.<br />The granny donkey has nothing to do and gets grumpy when her son and granddaughter don’t visit her enough. (Apparently her granddaughter has no mother as there is no mention of her at all.) Granny donkey is only grinning and happy when her son and granddaughter make time to visit her. [Insert my eyeroll here.]<br />It doesn’t portray healthy relationships. It doesn’t portray the granny donkey in a good light. (She’s more of a bored toddler pitching a fit than an adult with her own life and ability to visit people herself.)  And it isn’t funny or clever, so there is nothing really redeeming going on. The Wonky Donkey was cute. This isn’t.",negative

"**I was given an advanced readers copy. All opinions expressed are my own.**.  every so often I like to mix things up a bit and read something different. I usually read cozy mysteries,and an occasional light romance....but this is not either of those! This is one that I was referring to about mixing it up, I fell in love with the characters in the first book called &#34;Red on the run&#34;. This book will keep you in suspense from the very beginning...and at times it will make your heart start pumping...( I actually found myself reading faster as the excitement was escalating,lol)..... thinking that the syndicate is fading away after 17 years,Jason is writing a book about them and the corruption they bring ,until dead bodies are being discovered and he realizes that the syndicate has never really stopped ...they just have been regrouping and are coming back even stronger...and &#34;they&#34; want control of what Jason is writing about them in his book... this is a real page turner. another great suspenseful read from a great author...I highly recommend this book as well as the first...and I cannot wait for the next one.",positive

"Two daughters search for their fathers. A man searches for his Professor and his wife, who he believed were dead. Each search happens in a different time and place, but each storyline blends and intertwines to form a cohesive tale involving the very evil Vlad (AKA Dracula, the Conqueror or Vlad the Impaler). As each sets out on their journey to discover the truth, they eventually tell us a little about Vlad lure and history, all revealed thru letters and flashbacks.<br /><br />I will not say that ""The Historian"" was the most engrossing vampire read, but it was definitely not the worse. I thought the imagery and attempt at suspense building was ok, but it wasn't ""can't put it down good""..instead it was definitely a slow, methodical process to reveal a truth that you always knew or suspected. If you need something historical, with a slight twist on the vamp theme (Dracula wants a library), then you'll enjoy it.",negative
This book is wonderful! I wish it had been around when my daughter was younger. The book is great for girls in the elementary to middle school age range. It introduces the reader to 30 girls who do amazing things before they were 20. It's well written and engaging. I found it easy to read. The information is presented in an interesting and captivating way. The illustrations that go with it are beautiful! I'm embarrassed to say that I wasn't familiar with all of these young women. My daughter is 17 now and she has enjoyed skimming through it and picking out bit and pieces. Maybe it will inspire her!,positive

This book drags on eternally, never makes a point and eventually ends with more questions than answers. I thought even the character that I usually love fell flat this time. I almost think that Patricia Cornwell resented having to write another one of these novels or something. I try to not leave a one star unless I really, really hate a book, but this one is deserving. I can't recommend this book. If you want to read a novel in this series, read one of the older ones.",negative

It’s been a long time since I’ve had any first graders, but my first thought was that it was somewhat above grade level. I used to be an elementary teacher. I’ve taught 3rd, 4th and 5th grades. I am currently a working in a middle school special education class and I thought some of the pages would work well with those students.  But the more I thought about it, I decided that maybe it is on grade level or at least close to it. I read through several of the pages and the material is age appropriate. There are no obvious errors or mistakes that stand out when skimming through it. There is a good variety of topics. It starts with some reading comprehension passages. Then it covers an assortment of Language Arts topics such as capitalization, pronouns, punctuation, phonics, just to name a few. The answers are in the back and in some cases, explanations are given to help with the understanding. There are also a couple of practice tests. I think this will be an excellent learning resource for my niece this summer!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

"As a big fan of 2019's Daisy Jones & The Six, I've been looking forward to Taylor Jenkins Reid's follow-up.  2021's Malibu Rising is a worthy next step, although I still give Daisy the nod.  Dense, cross-generational plotline and both in-the-moment and flashback-style storytelling technique seems very filmic -- not a criticism as it works very well.  Read almost like a screenplay, I found myself casting the film in my mind as I pushed on through.  After a bit of a slow start, I felt rewarded as I stuck with it and the pace picked up nicely.  The storytelling is strong throughout, the characters nicely drawn, and the ongoing action -- past and present -- true-to-life believable.  If, like me, you found yourself hooked on Daisy & The Six, I think you'll find Malibu Rising a most worthy follow-up novel.",positive

"Inspired by David Simon’s classic [[ASIN:0805080759 Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]] (which in turn inspired the hit TV series), A GOOD MONTH FOR MURDER is a pretty good account of the murder-solving activities of Maryland’s Prince George County homicide detectives during the month of February 2013.  There was nothing special about that month, except for its spike in new murder cases (12 total victims).  Author Del Wilbur followed the detectives (including a couple of rookies who were working their first homicides) in real time, as the detectives were assigned the cases according to a regular rotation.<br /><br />If anything, the book shows that being a homicide detective is a lot like being a newspaper reporter.  Most cases are solved through interviews with witnesses (actual crime scene witnesses, family members, the victim’s neighbors, the perp’s friends or partners in crime, tipsters).  Some cases can’t be solved at all, if no one will talk and the perp keeps quiet about the crime.  In short, crime-solving is usually a slog that involves long hours of chasing down leads.  The detectives’ one advantage over reporters is that they can call on the Fugitive Squad or regular police officers to bring in suspects for questioning.<br /><br />A GOOD MONTH FOR MURDER should be of special interest to readers in Maryland and the District of Columbia, who may recognize some of the more high-profile crimes (e.g., the pointless murder of a 71-year-old woman during a robbery of her cheap TV set).  Because I like fact crime, I enjoyed the book, but there’s nothing particularly new about it, nothing that sets it apart from other books and documentaries about homicide squads.  I rate it at 4 stars (“I like it” on the official Amazon scale).",positive

Kate, the lead character, is approaching her fiftieth birthday and is going through perimenopause. I just turned 50 a few months ago and her descriptions about aging are spot-on. Kate's daughter, Emily is 16 and her interactions with her sounded very familiar to my own with my 17 year old daughter. Fortunately, my daughter hasn't gone through all of Emily's trials. There are many laugh out loud moments which may not be as funny for those who haven't experienced those aging milestones. One problem that I had with this book (and similarly with the first book, too) is that there are long periods of writing without any dialogue. I realize that's just a style of writing, but when I am reading books with that format, I tend to get sloppy with my reading and start skimming a lot. I blame it on the Speed Reading class I took back in junior high. Inevitably, I will sometimes miss something important and have to go back and reread parts to comprehend what's going on. Overall, it was a fast paced story with a realistic voice.",positive
This book could have been so good accept for all the story pages that have the exact same design over and over on about 15 pages...all they needed to do was make the frames different no one wants to color the same design that many times...boring,negative
"Maybe I'm a prude - if such a person exists anymore - but I was disappointed and surprised to find the ""f-word"" on page five.

"I am given this edition daily despite not asking for it and there's no way to turn it off. Usually I just delete the copies that have accumulated on my devices but occasionally I listen to one. Sometimes it's mildly enjoyable or marginally informative.<br /><br />After today's copy I'll never listen to it again. Every, and I mean every story narrated for the whole length of the audible was about Trump or detailed unrelated news in regard to its relationship to Trump or just mentioned Trump somewhere in the article regardless of the subject. I literally couldn't believe it as I continued to listen.<br /><br />This same phenomena has saturated all news outlets from The New York Times to The Wall Street Journal. I already don't bother with video news media and YouTube postings.<br /><br />Trump is not that interesting. I don't care what he thinks about snowflakes or yogurt or other individuals.<br /><br />At worst this is yellow journalism, at best it's simply lazy. There is no real news anymore among the major venues. There are silly stories made up by silly writers who only consider ratings as they insert Trump and other  keywords as they formulate the hot topic of the day. It's made-up.",negative
"Ever since the diminutive Tom Cruise played the tall and awesome Jack Reacher, I can't read the books anymore. All I see in my mind's eye is this grinning (like a crazed monkey) Tom Cruise as  Jack Reacher. Sorry, bad casting caused this reader to turn to John Sandford.",negative
"This was a fun, engaging YA book. It was a fast paced, page turner. The chapters alternated between the present day, when the two sisters are stuck on a deserted island to the months preceding where their relationship broke. I didn't like the older sister, Henri much at all. She did go through some redemption though. The younger sister, Emma, had an unhealthy obsession with her older sister that I thought was a bit weird. I have a sister and I love her, but this sisterly relationship was a bit too much. She does show so much needed growth. Alex, the boy who was trapped on the island with them was the most likeable character in my opinion. I used to fantasize about being on deserted island with a cute boy, so I found that aspect to be fun and exciting. There is a lot of alcohol use in the months before they were on the island and some sex and drug use, too, but it's not glorified. Overall, I enjoyed the book and will pass it along to my teenage daughter for her to read.",positive
"I couldn't really get into this book, probably because the subject matter didn't interest me. It seemed disconnected & way too long.",negative
"I have to admit that this was one of the darkest and most depressing novels that I have ever, in my entire life (well maybe ""The Warmest December"" and ""Sybil"" were as dark, just better written with better story lines)...anyway, this novel was so depressing...I think I said that already..that it was difficult to read and often you were so turned off by the writing style, the subject matter, the characters (obese mother, triffling/raping father, rape, incest, AIDS, Social Service Agencies, Broken foster/Social care system, etc) that you did not want to finish it. The only interesting thing that I found about the novel was that it was written in the voice of the victim, an uneducated teen (kind of reminded me of the Color Purple, although that was a better story). And as things progressed in her life, the writing did improve. The most redeeming thing about the novel is that you can see how people by nature, especially children are SURVIVORS and are shaped by their circumstances. One would learn that you can either deal and live, or simply give up and die. So no matter what I thought of the novel, Precious (symbolism in her name) was a survivor and made the best of her circumstances. And has not certain people felt to the need to get involved, she may very well have not made it.",negative

"From all the reviews I've read about this book, I wanted the audiobook.  That was a mistake.  This has to be the worst narration I've heard yet.  I listen to a lot of audiobooks and have been pretty pleased.  The majority of narrators use the Conversational Delivery method rather than Natural Reading.  Some narrators manage and some sound forced.  But this book?  Is a total fail.  The narrator is all over the place.  It really takes away from the story.",negative
"""Loving Everyone"" starts out a little bit like [[ASIN:0060817097 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]] elaborating on the author's dog Mollie's antics. This part of the story is both entertaining and lightly funny.  The remaining two thirds of the book are about enlightenment and loving everyone.  The author elaborates on how Mollie is happy to see everyone including the homeless and others people would normally avoid by just living in the moment and greeting everyone with the same acceptance.<br /><br />The story is intertwined with little ""teachings"" from Buddhism. For instance, if someone calls me horrible names and I choose not to accept to receive such bad behavior and words then it still belongs to the person who is spewing out that negativity. One can understand this by thinking of the answer to this question. ""If a friend approached you offering a gift, but you declined to accept it, to whom does the gift belong?""  The answer is that it still belongs to your friend.<br /><br />Although this story is not earthshattering, ""Loving Everyone"" is an easy and enjoyable read with a few pearls of wisdom.  As the book states, we are living and dying in the same breath (""right now"") so why not be kind, live for today, and avoid negativity just like the author's dog Mollie is doing.",positive

She really enjoyed this book so much, that she has started reading the previous one. The book starts on the day of the death of the main character's brother.  The book is about moving on and accepting the death of his brother. The main character and the brother were very likeable. It was well written and easy to get into. It kept my daughter's attention and she was engaged throughout the whole book. It ended satisfactorily and wasn't what was expected. Every chapter started with cooking and a list of ingredients. It was a fun, easy read.",positive

"After reading this book cover to cover, I had picked up only one shortcut button sequence and no tips or tricks.  This is a good book for someone who has never picked up a digital camera or an SLR camera before (if you're used to a normal 35mm camera and need to learn both digital and SLR at once you'll be overwhelmed and this can help you).  The pictures are good and the explanation is simple enough, but if you've used a digital or an SLR you can pick most of this information up without a book.  It didn't go into anything that was difficult to understand.  I bought the book before the camera and learned nothing from it, so I can imagine that if I had the camera first I wouldn't even have bothered buying the book.",negative
"The author, Susannah Charleson, is a Search and Rescue Volunteer (SAR) who worked mostly with her dog Puzzle on locating missing, lost, and deceased persons. She has recently gotten into Missing Animal Response (MAR) work and is training her dog Ace on locating missing, lost, and deceased pets.<br /><br />This book is a smattering of various interesting stories about her life and her rescue missions of various pets. She was brought up by two parents, who at a very young age, taught her to respect animals and lead by example in rescuing many homeless animals or owned animals who were just lost and needed help getting back home.<br /><br />The end of the book provides an excellent list of what to do if your pet goes missing and how to prepare for such an event.<br /><br />I learned that animals get loose when we think they never will. I also learned that making direct eye contact, calling out to them, or running after them actually does more harm than good and could result in getting them killed in traffic. She mentioned that many animals are found along the greenbelt which is the periphery of where land meets civilization. A lot of times animals are not far from home. Also, that wonderful pet at home acts very differently, if not aggressively when lost.<br /><br />This was an excellent and enjoyable read to me. Other than the minor grammatical errors typical of a pre-release book, this author has certainly matured in her writing style since I read her first pre-release book, ""The Scent of the Missing."" Overall, this is well done.",positive
"I do not care for books that do not have a nice final happy ending as the resolution. I feel like if you pay for a full book, you deserve the chance to read a complete story that leaves you feeling satisfied at the end, not a big cliffhanger that says &#34;please by the next one in the series.&#34; The writing is competent, of course, from this multi-published author and it was an okay read. It has a lot of characters and different stories. It does switch from the first to third person point of view depending on who is speaking, which I also didn't care for as much. You can read it without reading the other books, although you can see some of the other characters popping in here and there. It was slow at times. Books that don't have a happy ending, or really an ending at all, are not for me.",negative

Also, the questions at the end of the chapter feel like lazy attempts and sometimes the answers are not even located in the material and have to be googled in order to answer. This is the worst text book I’ve ever used.",negative
I was blown away by this beautiful book. Alyson has obviously poured her heart and soul into it and it shows as the writing just flows across the page.

"Maeve Binchy has always been in my top five authors. I loved her previous works enough to start collecting them. When i bought this book I settled down with a cup of tea and prepared myself for an enjoyable afternoon. Boy was I wrong. This book was nothing like the previous novels I had come to expect. From the very beginning it was confusing, boring and overwhelmed me with too many characters with no real value. I kept hoping that it would start to make sense and the storyline would emerge, but it just never happened. I finished this book on the stupid rule I have about never leaving a book half read and gritted my teeth through the pain. the book had a beautiful cover and an interesting blurb on the back, but just as I have seen with theater previews...that may have been the best part!",negative

"Close to Death is the third book in The Sensitives series by Rick Wood. Sadly I have to say after I really enjoyed the first two books, this one fell short for me. The plus the pace was good and there is anyways something going on. A new character, Martin, is introduced and I am curious to see if we will see more of him, personally I wouldn't mind.<br /><br />Now the plot concept was very interesting and unique, however I felt the execution was just not what it could have been. There were some decisions the author made, and yes it is his book, but to me they just didn't make sense. So we basically, without giving away spoilers, have four main characters, yet they are incapable of talking to each other. It is absolutely infuriating and yes I get it done of it is part to have the plot he developed, however I think the complete lack of communication is ludicrous. People who are friends and even lovers should talk more than these characters do. That to me just ruined it.<br /><br />Here is to hopi g that the next one will get it back to where this started so I can continue enjoying this series and don't have to call it quits.",negative
"Awesome book even if you have no plans on following the Whole30 diet. It breaks down what happens to your body when you eat, how hormones are affected, what happens when you don't eat, and much more about what food does to your body.

"This book has about one-fifth the ""story line"" even of book 4, and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux, greyscale, bad weather and maggoty food.  NOT what one would expect from the author being touted as the ""American Tolkein.""<br />It's utterly unsatisfying, to the point where I am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.<br />If you feel compelled to read it, just to find out how bad it is for yourself, at least don't spend any money on it.  Go get it at the library.  You'll feel slightly less ripped off that way",negative

"The S.A.S.S. (Students Across the Seven Seas) series focuses on the lives of several female high school students that are studying abroad for a semester. In ""When Irish Guys Are Smiling,"" Delk Sinclair escapes Nashville for Connemara after struggling with the recent death of her mother and her father's remarriage to a very young (now pregnant) bride who's determined to strip every trace of Delk's mother during the renovation of her house. Delk can't bear the thought of her presentation to Nashville society without her mother to help her, and is tired of her friends' pity and shallow lives.<br /><br />In Connemara, she studies Irish history and culture at Tremain Castle along with several other American students: up-and-coming model Latreece, who's dying to model in Paris despite her mother's wishes, the triplets Lucy, Brent and Trent from New Hampshire, and sports jock Iris. Throughout the story, all of the students are changed by their time in Ireland and their newfound connections with Irish culture, from sheepshearing to pub nights to a camping trip to the Aran Isles. Delk even finds romance in the form of Pather, who's attending college part-time and working on his father's farm.<br /><br />""When Irish Guys Are Smiling"" is a quick read that touches on Irish culture, finding independence through study abroad, high school friendships, and issues like the death of a parent and coping with grief in a believable way; I couldn't put it down and read it in a couple of hours.

"THE WEDDING GUEST: AN ALEX DELAWARE NOVEL is one of the best of the “Alex Delaware” series.  The premise is quite fresh and intriguing--how do you solve a crime when the hard-to-identify victim turns out to have been living entirely “off the grid”?  How do you find a killer with a motive for murder, when the victim has no driver’s license, no fixed address, no cell phone number, and no social media presence?<br /><br />In the novel, a bridesmaid finds an expensively dressed young woman dead in a bathroom at a “Saints and Sinners” wedding reception.  To carry out the theme, the reception was being held at the site of a former strip joint, an incredibly sleazy one at that.  Problem is, no one (not the bride, the groom, the bridesmaids, the groomsmen, or the wedding guests) has any idea who the victim is.  But she was definitely murdered--strangled after being drugged with a syringe of fentanyl.<br /><br />Eventually, a manager of the former strip joint is able to identify the victim as a one-time, very short-term, employee.  But the ID doesn’t help the investigation, because there is no recent trace of where the woman was living, of her recent associates, or of what she was doing to support herself.  And why was she even attending the wedding of a pair of strangers?<br /><br />The novel isn’t particularly fast-moving, which is typical of the “Alex Delaware” novels.  However, the investigation is consistently interesting, and the conclusion is satisfying.",positive

"Cindee Martin Morgan has written a beautiful pro-life novel aimed at young adults about life's choices and the consequences that echo throughout time and space and eternity. Suri, the main character, seeks to rescue a brother she never knew who was aborted and her mother who's life hangs in the balance. Rescue Me tackles the issue of abortion and the necessity of sharing one's faith. This story is both timely and needed in a culture that more often not ignores the fact that life begins at conception and that abortion is always an option should a young woman get pregnant. As one who's 15-year old birth-mother chose adoption rather than abortion, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. A must read!",positive
"I never heard of Syd and Shea McGee before I ordered this book. However, with a title such as ""Make Life Beautiful"" from a ""design couple,"" I thought (like everyone else) that this was a picture book. Nevertheless, I read the reviews prior to ordering and discovered this is a ""words only"" story of one married couple's journey of setting up their own design business.  Since I love art, am a fan of high-end craft shows, and used to be a subscriber to Architectural Digest, their journey held my interest. It is a quick, enjoyable, and upbeat read.<br /><br />Both Syd and Shea, husband and wife team, describe how they wound up establishing their own design firm and going from Shea McGee Design (wife only), to Studio McGee in 2014, and also establishing their ecommerce brand McGee & Company, and opening a store and then closing it after Covid-19.<br /><br />What I love about this story is that they shared their ups and downs to their success. Sharing their experience proves to others who have a vision that this is what life and an entrepreneurial journey is all about. In addition to how their vision developed, Shea  also shares inspirational lines that will ""speak"" to most readers, such as:<br /><br />""Design is about creating and looking for opportunities to elevate everyday.""<br /><br />""Regardless of where you are in your journey, it's not about having all the answers -- it's about seeing the potential""<br /><br />In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed their story. Yes, I wish there were some pictures of the family or the original bookcase that started their journey, but I can search online and see a lot of their designs, so it is not totally necessary.",positive

"I found this book difficult to keep straight. There are several main characters and there's a lot of jumping around from character to character. The Muslim boy was my favorite character. He was the only character that was approachable, genuine and had good intentions. The whole story takes place over approximately one day, so it was slow moving. It requires a lot of descriptions to cover such a short time span, which the author does pretty well. The beginning of the school day, each character has a secret that doesn't get revealed until the end, so it appears that everyone is suspicious. The actual motives behind the bombing were a little unrealistic in my opinion, however, the topic is timely. Overall, it was interesting and entertaining.",positive

"This is the second book that I have read in the Librarians in Love series. I enjoyed this one a lot more than Falling for Trouble. The main characters were more likeable in this book. The premise of the story one that's used a lot, but fun nonetheless.  Girl has a one night stand with hot guy with the intent of never seeing him again. Hot guy turns out to be the new lawyer where she works, so there goes that plan. Although I did like both of the main characters (and the supporting characters, too), I thought that Becky's reasons for not wanting to date Foster were pretty lame. Foster's so called faults weren't that bad in my opinion. Both Becky and Foster have dysfunctional families.  Madison, Foster's kid sister was the only family member that I liked. I loved the whole &#34;Dog Adoption Shelter&#34; story line. The ending was a little abrupt, but there was an epilogue that helped a bit. It was a quick read and very entertaining.",positive
"I’m used to odd books. As a homeschool mom, some of the best resources are a little odd. This one does not fit that category. I’ll go with the positive first. Introducing state capitals as people is clever. It does lend itself to better memory, if you’re a person who learns people and names better than facts. That is where the positives end with this book.<br />You’ve got five friends who each tour a different region of the US visiting their friends. Each two page spread features a new state with a lot of info for each state. The information is good, but the way it is presented is just overwhelming and not easily processed. It is very poorly written.<br />The illustrations are terrible. The font choices are awful. The graphics are very dated. Pretty sure I remember doing block wave graphics on my first computer back in junior high. The entire look of this book is terrible. It is just a jumbled mess of information.",negative

She meets a handsome Scottish man who helps her to safety after the death of her parents and attack on her family home. There's a lot of historical war activity as well as steamy romance.There was a lot more pre-marital sex than I have read in other historical romances, however it was all monogamous.

On the “front” of the month, there is a habit tracker page. Then you have your weekly pages. My complaints are about the weekly pages. They begin the weeks with Monday. I hate that. On the monthly layout, they begin on Sunday, then the weeklies, they begin on Monday. Next, the weeks have an inconsistent layout. They added some variety in the “notes” section. So sometimes you have lined note space. Sometimes blank note space. Sometimes quotes or “assignments “. I wish it was consistent. And I wish it was just lined note space. I also love that they didn’t duplicate days within the week spread. Whatever month the majority of the week falls in, it is inside that month’s tab. The paper is nice quality. I could have done without the excessive quotes. But overall, a really impressive planner.",positive
"A great story teller, peppered with the political and huge changes in China at the time.  I am fascinated with the culture and the author gave a brilliant glimpse of life and time for women, mixed raced women, and whilst it was a mere 100+ years ago..a lot has changed and yet, a lot has not with the Chinese culture.  I certainly felt the understood the main character in the book, and the emotions were eloquently described, dream like as in life when you have time to reflect.  The superstition in Chinese culture was wonderfully portrayed.  I loved the book.  Well written, easy flow, and I wanted a happy ending.  As in all of Chinese stories: it has the bitter, sour and sweet in it.",positive
"As with all Lonely Planet products, this is a great travel guide to Iceland. My son is planning a trip there this summer and was looking for something he could use to research the country and begin his planning, as well as have something small enough to bring with him when he is there. Chock full of information, this handy guide gives him all the information he needs for a fun trip with his friends. Hours of operation and entry fees of parks and sites, restaurants in the area (with information on prices) and hotels (and hostels) they can stay at. Loads of maps and information as well. You can't go wrong when traveling when you bring a Lonely Planet guide with you on vacation. It has everything you need to be a well informed tourist and allows you to live like a local when you visit.",positive
"SCANDINAVIAN CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS is a collection of patterns for 22 Christmas stockings, 1 cap, 1 pair of mittens, and 1 pair of leggings.  To me, the designs all look fairly similar. ""Christmas"", the book cover design, is fairly typical of the look of most of the stockings.<br /><br />Although the designs are built around traditional Scandinavian knitting motifs (trees, reindeer, stick figures, dancers), they are not based on historical examples of knitted Scandinavian stockings.  They are the author's new designs.  There are no thumbnail photos of ethnic, museum-quality, knitted Scandinavian stockings.  However, there are charts for three different, very nice alphabets, to be used in adding names to the stockings.<br /><br />The charted Fair Isle designs are written for  2-ply Gammelserie (6.5-7 sts/in, on 2.5mm-3.0mm needles or US 1-2 needles) and 3-ply Strikkegarn (5-6 st/in, on size 3.0 mm-3.5 mm needles or US 2-3 needles).  The book does not include the above gauge information, or suggest any suppliers, but you can use Google to find U.S. sources for these traditional Scandinavian yarns.  You can also substitute any high-twist yarn that gives approximately the same gauge.  (After all, with Christmas stockings, you're not trying to knit a sock that will be worn by someone.)<br /><br />The patterns are fairly difficult--some call for knitting with three colors in a single row--so they're best for adventurous intermediate and advanced knitters.  Because I'm not particularly drawn to any of the stocking designs, I rate SCANDINAVIAN CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  If you're looking for Christmas stocking patterns, some other good books you might consider are [[ASIN:1931499004 Christmas Stockings: Holiday Treasures to Knit]], and [[ASIN:1580175058 Knit Christmas Stockings!: 19 Patterns for Stockings and Ornaments]] (both books are out of print, but used copies are available).",positive

"This is a good travel guide. It highlights the Western National Parks of the USA. It gives several suggested trips to optimize your travels. There are some photos, but I would love to see more.

"Talk to the Paw is a sweet, slow moving romance. MacGyver, the cat, has match making skills. I thought it was a little strange at first because the cat's point of view and perspectives are given, but it actually works. The human characters are engaging and entertaining. Jamie, new to town, is trying to find her life passion while David is still getting over the death of his wife. It was a little slow moving at times and I found it easy to stop at the end of a chapter instead of keep on reading. Overall, I enjoyed it.",positive

"The author, of Greek heritage, goes to Greece to better understand how the nation will cope with the effects of the 2008 financial crash on it and its membership in the EU.<br /><br />He sees modern Greece as corrupt, with its government, via kickbacks, bribes, etc, providing easy living for all government workers and their descendants. Greeks don't see this as bad, just making up for brutal treatment under the Ottoman Empire. Plus, taxes go underpaid.<br /><br />Kind of a paradox, a nation as a birthplace of democracy, science and reason, now a dysfunctional government and people who expect to be rewarded.<br /><br />Meanwhile, those with ties to the government do pretty well, while those tied to the private economy either do well and move money out of Greece, or suffer.<br /><br />Greece probably cooked the books to get accepted  to the EU and cannot meet reforms because the nation lives on corruption.<br /><br />Also, past NAZI occupation of Greece during WW2 still evokes passion, such they see Germany as just the latest evil incarnation of the past, via the austerity wanted in proposed reforms. Talk of WW2 reparations still are prevalent.<br /><br />The author uses lots of interviews to paint his picture of recent Greece and I recommend the book to better understand Greece in relation to the current financial situation.",positive

"This is a perfect beginner's guide to aromatherapy. A basic overview of what aromatherapy is, tools and equipment, a list of popular oil brands, and an inventory of the top ten oils are reviewed in the first third of the book (part one). There is also a mention of safety precautions to be aware of and some subsitutes that can be used in place of one of the top ten oils.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is that the last two thirds of the book (part two) is aromatherpay in action. There are recipes for various blends and purposes that can be used as inhalers, in diffusers, in lotions, and shampoos. Most of this book's recipes (about 97%) are dedicated to blends for inhalers and diffusers.  There are a few recipes I can see myself eventually making and using.<br /><br />In summary, this book is a well-rounded aromatherapy guide but it is by no means complete as the title suggests. I think it is a great complement to a well-stocked aromatherapy library.",positive
"The book is very slow and deliberate in approach, and it’s not surprising that the end leads to nothing.

All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source.

"Siena, Tuscany, is famous for its Palio, a yearly event where ten of the city's seventeen Contrade compete in a brutal, blink-and-you-miss-it horse race. This tradition dates back to the 17th century in its present form. The Daughter of Siena is set in 1723, where Pia Tolomei, descendent of Queen Cleopatra, is told that she'll wed a man from a rival contrade on her nineteeth birthday. Hardly the news that Pia had hoped for. At the Palio the next day, a handsome stranger appears as the jockey for the Torre contrada. Pia is instantly drawn to him, unlike the cruel, calculating man her father has chosen for her. A shocking event puts a quick end to the normal Palio festivities, and the course of Pia's future is changed forever.<br /><br />The remainder of Pia's story is one of political intrigue and thwarted romance. This is no lighthearted historical romp; there are quite a few graphic scenes. There are several dark undercurrents involving murder, torture, madness, and gluttony that were uncomfortable to read at times. The author includes a virtual menagerie of unlikable secondary characters, from a snaggletooth abusive maid to a gluttonous gay Medici who indulges all his corporeal appetites with impunity. Many of the figures are based on actual historical figures (Violante, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Gian Gastone).<br /><br />Marina Fiorato excels at her vivid descriptions of the Palio; they're informative and engaging without disrupting the flow of the story, and one portion of the Palio narrative appears word for word in a later chapter, bringing the story full circle. The elegant descriptions of period clothing were in stark contrast to the cutthroat world of court politics and damp cellars and ruins where secret midnight meetings were held.  However, a good part of the plot feels recycled from Fiorato's earlier novel [[ASIN:0312606362 The Botticelli Secret (Reading Group Gold)]]. Still, fans of historical fiction (and Tuscany) will find much to recommend The Daughter of Siena.",positive
"Kathleen Murphy lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1937. Ireland is in the midst of another Depression, and Kathleen's father is out of work. After showing up to her (Catholic) school late one too many times, one of the sisters recommends Irish dance lessons as a way to keep Kathleen out of trouble. Kathleen finds from the very first lesson that she loves to dance and has a real talent for it, but the issue of not being able to pay for classes nearly ends her career at the beginning.<br />She is chosen to represent her dance school at a feis (dance competition), but is haunted by her mother's severe illness and her lack of money for a dance costume (a requirement to participate). Her favourite Aunt Polly grows distant as well, and Kathleen prays for a miracle. Her miracle does indeed come, but not in a way anyone expected!<br />""Kathleen: The Celtic Knot"" is a fabulous read, very Irish in character (each novel is written by someone from the country it takes place in) and similar at times to Irish novelist Frank McCourt's voice. Many Irish expressions and Gaelic words are sprinkled liberally in the text. The back of the book features a segment on life in Ireland and a glossary of Irish/Gaelic words and expressions. An uplifting tale for American Girl fans and Irish dance enthusiasts, those who love Irish culture or those just looking for an entertaining read.",positive

"I would not say this book is complete. This is just basic, full color handwriting practice for a kid who needs some practice with handwriting. This is not the only book you’ll need for kindergarten through third grade. This is not even a full curriculum by itself. It is really just handwriting practice. I would say the writing is a bit small for a kindergartener. It looks more second grade size to me. It begins with shape practice on the lines. Working on the shapes needed to make letters. You have a full page of letter practice for each letter of the alphabet and then you have three pages of practice writing random phrases and sentences using those letters. Once you get through all the letters you have pages to write numbers, colors, days of the week, months of the year, etc. Basic stuff to practice. Then you have seasons, school words, family words, etc. to practice. Then you move to cursive with the same format, though different words, as the print section.<br />This is not a full handwriting curriculum. Yes, it does tell you which direction to form letters. It does not show you how to hold your pencil or how to position your paper. It does have plenty of practice opportunities for handwriting. The pages do show a lot of shadowing- you can see the next page through the current page. This is very hard in a handwriting book as kids may think they should trace the faint words they can see. As a practice book, I’d give it 4 stars. (As I would prefer to keep print and cursive in two separate books.) As a handwriting curriculum, which is what it is selling itself as, it just falls very short of what I would expect and doesn’t cover the mechanics of handwriting or even give enough detail about forming letters. I’m also not a fan of the writing random phrases and words. Seems like there are much better things to write than “Insects itch in the infield.”",negative

I plan to take mine to our women's Bible study this Thurs to share with my study group. I'm hopeful that the author will continue writing similar devotionals for other books in the Bible.

"I know it's my fault but the size of this coloring book should not be hidden down in the 'product dimensions' section of the Product Details are, eight lines down. So utterly disappointed and disgusted getting a 5&#34; x 8&#34; coloring book when every other coloring book I've bought have been full size 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; coloring books. These pictures are small, cramped and hard to color. The size should have been openly disclosed in the main product information. I blame myself but also the publisher. Even worse? This and the other two surprisingly small coloring books were chosen from the back of [[ASIN:1574219952 Good Vibes Coloring Book (Coloring Is Fun)]] which is a full size coloring book but even worse a good third of the content of  this 'Color Cool' book are IN the Good Vibes coloring book.

"This book quickly became property of my 2 year old. He loves Mister Doodle. He loves reading this book over and over. The illustrations are cute half doodle, half picture illustrations. My only problem with the book, and it isn't a big thing, is the use of ""C is for City."" It is easier to teach little ones the hard C sound first. So, I would prefer it to say ""C is for Cab"" or something like that, rather than using the ""ci"" sound. Of course, my 2 year old didn't notice that. (Neither did his 4 year old brother or 5 year old sister.) I just prefer to teach the soft c once they've mastered the hard c.",positive

"This is an excellent guide for guidance counselors and other coaches who need to help others evolve into great leaders. The take away for me is that great leaders must attain those skills not by being told what to do but by having them take part in the coaching process and being the ones who turn themselves into great leaders through effective coaching. It is important for those being coached not to be dismissed, ridiculed, etc. The coach must listen so that the coachee can grow. Evolving into a great leader is a lifelong journey both for the coach and the coachee.<br /><br />This book also highlights that coaches should not be too tied to a specific outcome (from those they coach) because they may be met with resistance. A leader should remember to LEAD (listen, empathize, appreciate, design).<br /><br />There is a lot of good advice in this book; however, to me it reads almost like a textbook. Although I enjoyed reading this (and I read it from cover to cover, even the Appendix), I feel this information is only one part of what is necessary to be an effective leader. The other part is to actually see someone put this into action and this book (the text and limited examples) did not resonate enough with me where I could visual how to take action effectively.",positive

Then it got to the point where I didn't want to put it down. The story is predictable and follows a standard romance formula., but enjoyable nonetheless. Girl finds out her boyfriend is married so she hires cute neighbor to pretend to be boyfriend. The plot sounds like it came straight out of romantic comedy. They go spend the Christmas holidays in Scotland with her wacky family. Fun characters and situations. There are a few laugh out loud parts, too.

"Rosie is learning to play The Dance of the Dinosaurs for her upcoming piano recital, but she's stumped by a tricky passage towards the end, made even more difficult by the fact that she was born with only nine fingers. She and her mother are holding down the fort since her father took a job in Milwaukee; their small mining town is gradually becoming a ghost down as the mines shut down.<br /><br />Rosie's mother is fragile and terrified at her seeming inability to run the house and take care of the two of them in her father's absence. She's scared by the smallest things, and Rosie doesn't want to upset her more when she thinks that someone is sneaking into their house when they're not home. She and her friend Angela decide to try and catch the burglar themselves, with some serious consequences.<br /><br />Running throughout the story is Rosie's struggle with learning the tricky passage in the Dance of the Dinosaurs. She's frustrated by her inability to play the piece as smoothly and quickly as she thinks she should be able to, although everyone from her parents to her piano teacher tells her to slow down and play at the speed that best works for her. Rosie begins to wonder if nine fingers ARE enough, especially after the spoiled rich Mary Jean gets the coveted final spot in the recital.<br /><br />In the end, Rosie solves her problem with a little help from her father, who sends her a family of stuffed dinosaurs that look like her own family, and she ends up being the star of the recital after an unexpected turn of events. This is a sweet, quick read that combines belief in oneself with the love of family and fear of the unknown, and is recommended for young readers who enjoy mysteries (and those who play piano, of course).",positive

"This is one of those items that no one really needs, but is just pure fun.  It's a great gift item for anyone who was a fan of Warhol or just anyone who does desk work.  I suppose there is a certain amount of usefulness in the set as well as the quirky fun aspect.  Who doesn't need a pencil sharpener, an eraser, a ruler, note pads and some stickers.  Everyone needs a banana bookmark and a cow head eraser!!!!  Not sure what I would use the sand timer for, but someone might have a use for it.  Kids might enjoy it too, but the box says not intended for children and says 14 years old and up.  What kid wouldn't love a cow head eraser or a banana bookmark?  And every kid loves stickers.  There are not a lot of stickers here though.  The sand timer might be only thing you wouldn't want to give them, as it is glass and could break and cause cuts.  The box itself that holds everything is a nice sturdy flip top box--nothing chintzy about it.  The box is worth keeping, unlike cheap boxes that fall apart quickly.  It is made of very heavy cardboard.  Just a great fun item to own or give as a fun gag gift.  There aren't many gag gifts as useful as this.",positive
"The description of the book has more meat than the book itself.  This disappointing book is a 15 short chapter breeze through a multitude of subjects, and does not linger long on any single subject.  There are some  nice diagrams and ten thousand foot views crammed into 374 total pages (the  page count vs. chapter count alone should indicate how superficial this  book is).  An example is the 21 pages devoted to weighty subjects  encompassing project management tasks, configuration management,  verification and validation, quality assurance, decisions and risks. Any  one of the topics would have merited at least 20 page in a serious book on  systems engineering. Useful to sales and marketing types who are selling  systems engineering services, and executive management who might like a  quick overview of systems engineering.  This book is useless for technical  professionals.",negative
"I found the first book in the Riches to Romance series to be a fun book, so I was happy to read this one. After a slow start, this book quickly became hard to put down. Things basically picked up after the location change. It's a fun, romantic story set mostly in Ireland. Tara, the heroine, is a Southern belle from Charleston. Although I really did like her, I felt that some of her Southern attributes were a bit stereotyped and not realistic. The chemistry between Tara and the two men was well written and engaging. I do feel like things wrapped up a little too quickly and that the passing of time was too short. Supposedly a couple of months take place, but it came off as just a couple of weeks. Regardless, I did find it a fun, light and fluffy read. I definitely want to read the next one in the series.",positive

"I was drawn to &#34;Reading with Patrick&#34; because I love books about teaching and the impact teachers can have on students.  Michelle Kuo, a recent graduate of an Ivy League school, is a bit undecided about what to do with her life.  She decides to sign up for Teach for America and is assigned to an impoverished school in Helena, Arkansas.  She is young and idealistic, and at first the students are challenging in a way that she could never have anticipated.  She persists, however, and through herculean effort makes an impression on many of them.<br /><br />Encouraged by her family and friends to go to law school rather than &#34;waste&#34; he talents and her Ivy League education on teaching, she takes the LSAT and is admitted, but then decides to teach for one more year.  She meets Patrick, a promising, intelligent, and sensitive student, and has her greatest success with him.  Later, upon graduating from law school, she gets a letter from Patrick, who is unfortunately awaiting trial for murder.  She returns to Helena, and they begin a close relationship through the seven months he is waiting for trial.  They connect through literature, and Patrick finds a way to express himself through poetry.  Michelle, too, grows through her friendship with Patrick.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parts of this book that dealt with literature and how Michelle was able to relate it to Patrick's life.  Less successful, in my opinion, was the exploration of Michelle's own growth and maturity.  However, I recommend this book for those who like books about personal growth and literature, and how literature can help us see truth and make sense of our world.  The book is easy to read and has many lovely moments that the reader will appreciate.",positive
"I’ve been progressively more disappointed with King’s offerings since Dreamcatcher and officially retired my Constant Reader title after The Outsider. I guess a misguided sense of loyalty and a huge number of rave reviews led me to take one more chance. Hard to believe that Mr. King wrote this awkward, poorly paced, and just plain bad novel! His characters have always been charismatic and complete; the reader’s entire experience hinges on feeling some interest in and attachment to, those characters. Lisey and her supporting cast evoked only boredom and annoyance. Nine chapters into the book, and we’re STILL hearing Widow Lisey’s internal musings over and over and over again. Now there are some teaser words in italics interjected to make sure you know that there’s more to the story than what you’re getting so far, but it’s crudely done and hard to care about. The cutsie nonsense words and insider jokes/phrases is likewise excessive. When you are 30% of the way into a book and you are STILL waiting for some kind of story to start, there’s a problem. All I can say is that IF SK REALLY wrote this book, I’m embarrassed for him.",negative
"I was hoping for a strong curry cookbook and I for the most part that is what I got.  There is good diversity in recipes and we use them as a foundation with a lot of departures.  In our case we are a mostly vegetarian household so we ended up swapping out tofu, mock duck and beyond chicken and occasionally a missing or extra ingredient, but using the recipes as a template.  We have probably made or adapted 6-8 meals in the last months and have been pretty happy and more comfortable with curry meals.  We have also made a couple meals using simmer sauces but vegetable combinations from the book.  So even if we are not following the recipes religiously, we are benefitting from the book.<br /><br />As for design, I did apprectiate the introduction information and the few images in the book.  This is another cookbook that would have been a lot more helpful and useful if it had a photo per recipe.  I know it is a lot more work for the publisher, but that is easily the biggest thing that makes a cookbook stand out for me.  But despite this shortcoming, this is a pretty good curry book.",positive
"I started reading this series because of the hype. I’m not typically into the whole bully romance thing but I thought I’d give it a try. At this point, I don’t see what the hype is about. The first two had me interested but by the end of the third book I just found myself annoyed. Everything is being way too drawn out and the characters are hardly showing any growth. I was disappointed with the order form that emerged though maybe reading further would change that. All the MCs are annoying in some way. Some more than others (Caleb and Tory). You’d think that with how serious things are, there would be more communication about it. But no, the focus is on being petty or horny (insert eye roll). Besides that, I’m enjoying the astrology aspect and there are some funny parts. But is it enough for me to read the rest? Ehhh….I’m not sure.",negative
"This is a lovely, romantic but also serious historical fiction story about Adele, an orphan who finishes her convent education and moves to Paris where she lands a job as Coco Chanel's assistant.  Their gadabout traveling life has been disrupted by the Nazi occupation of Paris. Chanel closes her fashion house, selling only her fragrances during wartime.  They move into the Ritz, which has been taken over and occupied by Nazi officers.  Cook tells this story from Adele's perspective, as she learns more about what the Nazis stand for, observes people being taken from their homes, never to be seen again, learns bits and pieces about the resistance and a lot about Chanel's political as well as romantic involvement with the Germans.  Along the way, Adele meets and befriends an American doctor, seeks help from him when she takes an impulsive action that could cause her serious trouble, and she must confront her own roles, always on the periphery, in facilitating Chanel's problematic behavior as well as the doctor's dangerous resistance related behavior. The Dressmaker's Secret also is about Chloe, Adele's British granddaughter.  It is 2018 and Chloe, recently divorced after a short lived, loveless marriage, moves to Paris for a year. She helps a friend from university run her boutique, as her friend just had a baby and needs help.  Adele has shared with her grandchildren that she worked for Coco Chanel for five years, but never discussed the experience of living in Paris during the war.  Chloe learns that evidence came out some years ago confirming longstanding rumors about Chanel:  She collaborated with the Nazis.  Was her grandmother complicit?  As she visits places her grandmother lived and worked and researches the files on Chanel, Chloe needs to learn the truth.  Adele is 97 and time is short.  Lorna Cook is a wonderful writer.  She  tells Chanel's story during the period well and consistently with what I already knew about this. Adele, an imagined character is a sympathetic person, an employee, yet in some ways the person who knows more about Chanel than anyone.  Her conflicting feelings about Chanel, about her own privilege in having food and a safe place to stay, about the doctor's extracurricular work and whether she should be doing more are compelling.  A fast and enjoyable read.",positive
"An absolutely lovely collection of historic African American standards alongside modern interpretations, you'll find beloved favorites like buttermilk fried chicken, greens with potlikker, fried fish, shrimp and grits, cornbread, and cobblers, but just as delicious are the vintage photographs showing early food vendors and tidbits of African-American culinary history. Arranged by geographic area, there are notes about original ingredients and modern substitions. Based on recipes from the Sweet Home Cafe at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, I was surprised that some of my childhood favorites I grew up with in Michigan (seafood cakes / salmon cakes) were also apparently a staple (where they would even be repurposed into other meals. Using fresh Lake Superior whitefish, I combined the recipes for the seafood cakes and the salmon croquettes with great success; the recipes are straightforward in ingredients and technique but deliver a great deal of flavor. This is a book that I've enjoyed reading cover to cover for the stories and rich cultural legacy as much as for the recipes themselves, which come highly recommended.",positive
"What I loved about this book: I learnt that when WWII was over, for some Jewish survivors that wanted to move out of Europe and to elect to live in Israel, freedom was still out of reach: for those sent to Atlit Internment camp, Israel.  The camp acted as a temporary internment until safe passage could be guaranteed by relatives who had already secured their own freedom.  In the meantime, men, women and children had to stay at the camp like prisoners.  All this did not make sense and the senselessness was portrayed through various relationships with the guards at the camp.  Despite all the confusion that is often associated with post war settlement and displacements of refugees: you can not place judgment on those who had to follow orders, but realize that through that journey: a human connection and decency to each other could still be had on a personal level.  Collectively, as a group, the understanding of what happened remained senseless.  I think this book portrays this contrast quite beautifully.<br /><br />The book is centered on four women; whose past experiences in WWII were either explained in a lot of detail or the details were sketchy; but their reaction and interaction with events and people in the camp, respectively, spoke volume of the anger and fear generated from those less transparent experiences.  To the author's credit, the holocaust experience has been so well documented, less dwelling on those details was appropriate.  Despite their confinement, the transformation and healing of each of the women were forgivingly understated, gently blossoming and even unobservable by their own eyes.  In the end, you wished all the luck that could be mustered for them.  Ultimately: the captive comment made by one of the women was that they had to move forward to the unknown, not look back.  I think they did just that.  A brilliant read.",positive
"I purchased the book for my college bound nephew who is a huge jello fan, as part of his Christmas bag.  He is quite good at inventing his own jello creations, but I thought he might like this for inspiration.  It's a lovely hardcover book with nice color pics.  He's going to love it. Only thing that would make it 5 stars would be a spiral back so that it stays open when you're using it.  Just a personal preference.",positive
"Any Other Family brings together a unique and diverse group of people, two married couples and a single women, who share something in common:  They each have adopted one or two children born of Brianna and Justin.  Justin seems to make babies and leave and Brianna is not ready to parent alone.  So the eldest daughter asks her tutor, a single woman, to take her in, the toddler twins went to an energetic supermom and her husband and the infant went to a teacher and her salesman husband.  All of them have Sunday dinners together, special events and holiday gatherings with the goal of keeping the siblings, siblings.  So, they are on their first vacation and Brianna calls.  She had a brief reconciliation with Justin and a new baby is on the way.  This book is not about any of that, though.  It is mostly about adults, each of whom carries baggage and some who carry trauma who have adopted children for a variety of reasons and are experiencing parenting in different ways.  The twins mother is always the get things done one, so they are on vacation in a fancy rental and it is not idyllic, nor is it horrible.  It is a story of the messiness of life and human relations and that fact that the most idealistic and well-intentioned ventures are still going to be fraught with human needs, broken bones, tension based on different personalities and perspective and ironing out the areas of conflict.  I thought this book sounded like it might be boring, but Brown creates characters who are not stereotypes, but who many of us recognize.  She digs into feelings and inner thoughts that none of us tend to cop to.  The children weave in and out of the adult circles, helping them correct course.  They are imperfect people with an amazing goal and they are making it work.  How to deal with the new baby is a central part of this process.  I was personally disappointed in one aspect of the novel in that regard, the ending, although ai suppose it made sense.",positive

There is some jumping around from the past when she meets her husband and of her younger life as well as to the present day. I will admit that my eyes teared up a bit as I neared the end.

"There is little of Inspector Sejer in the first half of the book and it is far from the police procedural that draws this reader to Fossum's work. I could not tolerate the main character's endless whining and self-pity. I couldn't bring myself to care about him and only wanted him locked up and shut up.<br /><br />Such misery! A gloomy story told from the perpetrator's POV. His state of mind, in all it's denial and self-centeredness is explored thoroughly. He disappoints his 16 year old daughter and breaks her heart over and over.<br /><br />Try one of the other titles in the series and you will be hooked:<br /><br />Inspector Sejer / Inspector Jakob Skarre series:<br />1995 - In the Darkness; English translation 2012<br />1996 - Don't Look Back; English translation 2002<br />1997 - He Who Fears the Wolf; English translation 2003<br />1998 - When the Devil Holds the Candle; English translation 2004<br />2000 - Calling Out For You; American translation: The Indian Bride, 2007<br />2002 - Black Seconds; English translation 2007<br />2004 - The Murder of Harriet Krohn; English translation 2014<br />2007 - The Water's Edge; English translation 2009<br />2008 - Bad Intentions; English translation 2010<br />2009 - The Caller; English translation 2011<br />2013 - Carmen Zita og døden<br />2014 - Helvetesilden",negative

"I'll be honest, I picked up this book thinking it was something else entirely. It is actually a book about homesteading, not homemaking. There is a difference between those two in my head. I am a homemaker, not a homesteader. I do not grow my own food. Yes, I make quite a bit from scratch, but the ingredients are purchased, not grown or raised by me. However, I did really enjoy this book. The first half was an eye opener into our consumer culture. The second half are the how-to's of making a go of homesteading and the values common among homesteaders. The information is presented thoroughly without talking in circles. It is well written.<br /><br />I found this book to be worth my time reading it. While I do not plan to become a homesteader, I did take many things to heart. It was a great reminder to be happy with what we have and not continually strive to have more. (The happiness isn't in the more, it is in having what you need and enjoying what you do.) My needs are met. I've got time to spend with my family. I'm a very blessed and fortunate woman. I am also trying to buy more locally. It also (along with a blog post by Mavis) made me rethink my decision to insist on traditional health insurance.<br /><br />If you're extremely mainstream, you may want to skip this book for now. But if you're already thinking about quality of life over making money and helping your neighbors, this book will be a good read for you, even if you can't or won't make the leap into full homesteading.",positive

"THEIR LITTLE SECRET: A TOM THORNE NOVEL is a depressing book. It sort of explores the “killer couple” phenomenon, where two relatively normal people meet and spark something in each other that transforms them into co-murderers.  I’m new to the “Tom Thorne” series, so I don’t know whether this one is typical; I rather suspect that it isn’t.  This is the 16th series novel (for the first, see [[ASIN:B00B6U094U Sleepyhead]]).<br /><br />The co-killers here (Sarah and Conrad) are (1) a crazy divorcee whose life revolves around dropping off and picking up her son (Jamie) at school; and (2) a virtuoso con man who fleeces single women out of all their money.  The spark for Sarah and Conrad is an instant recognition, at their first coffee-shop meeting, that the other is NOT what he or she appears to be to other people.  That, plus incredible sex.<br /><br />In the novel, a woman (Philippa) throws herself in front of a train.  Her act is caught on video surveillance tape, so it’s clear that she’s a suicide.  But Tom Thorne suspects there is something more to her death.  In following up with Philippa’s relatives, he learns that Philippa was recently victimized by a mysterious con man (yes, Conrad), and that the experience was what drove her to suicide.<br /><br />Subsequently, a pair of seemingly unrelated murders (a young man in Margate, a local school teacher) come to Thorne’s attention, and little clues start to add up, leading Thorne inevitably to the killer couple.  However, most of the book is devoted to the relationship between Sarah and Conrad—as it initially forms, and then as it eventually breaks down.  It’s the breakdown, of course, that is the couple’s downfall.<br /><br />I don’t know whether the novel accurately depicts “killer couple” psychology.  It’s an interesting read, but depressing (as previously mentioned).  Series readers won’t want to miss it, though, because of developments in Thorne’s ongoing relationship with his estranged partner Helen.",positive

"My sixth grader is a huge fan of scary stories. Goosebumps are right up his alley. He really liked this book. He said it was pretty easy reading for him, saying it was more of a fourth grade level of reading. He enjoyed the story, telling his siblings they had to read it. However, he said the end was disappointing to him. He would classify it as a horror story, but nothing too very scary.",positive
"First of all, this was not what I expected after reading the summary of the book. It was very interesting and not cliche' as first expected. It did take a little while to get into the story. It was a little confusing in the beginning, too. The pace is a bit slow. There is reference to drugs, sex, and alcohol. The main character is flawed and well written. I was torn between giving it a 3 star or 4 star review, but in the end I decided that it deserved 4 stars. It was entertaining and that is one of my ultimate goals of reading.",positive
"&#34;All Dogs Go to Kevin,&#34; a clear reference to &#34;All Dogs Go to Heaven,&#34; is a delightful book that will be loved and appreciated by anyone who loves dogs and has ever had a dog share his or her life.  Jessica Vogelsang, the author, details her own coming of age and her relationships with the three dogs she has owned:  Taffy, Emmett, and Kekoa.  She begins the journey in middle school and takes us on an emotional journey through high school, college, veterinary school, and marriage.<br /><br />The book is engaging and very easy to read; even kids in upper elementary grades would be able to manage it.  However, the part I found most compelling was the role that dogs play in the lives of, as the author puts it in her dedication, &#34;the misfits, the miscreants, the misunderstood, the freaks and geeks and socially inept, and the dogs who love them.&#34;  It is clear from the outset that the author sees herself as one of these &#34;misfits&#34; who found salvation in the love of a dog.  She write with grace and compassion of her relationship with both animals and people, and she clearly does not write off anyone, no matter what issues they may have.<br /><br />Some reviewers have compared the book favorably to James Herriot's &#34;All Creatures Great and Small.&#34;  I do not share this view.  I found Herriot's books far more charming and compelling and have read each one several times.  This book is just not in that category.  However, that is not meant to dismiss the many virtues of this book.  Almost any lover of dogs would enjoy and identify with the characters in the book, especially the author.  I recommend it highly, and if you are not expecting Herriot, you will enjoy this book exactly for what it is.",positive
"Daily readings for busy moms. That is what the title could have been. I'm not Catholic, but I did enjoy this book. Each day, you read a short Bible verse or quote from a Saint. There is a short prayer to read and then a small task to do that day to fix your mind on the reading and prayer. Each month is a particular theme, so you aren't jumping from one thing to the next each day. For a month, you cultivate and practice the same thing. It isn't enough to really be considered a devotional, but it is a great way for a busy mom to start the day in the right frame of mind. (I wouldn't consider it to be enough to comprise the bulk of your devotional reading each day. I do wish they also included some extra Bible passages to read along with it to bulk up the substance a bit.)",positive

"Really enjoyed my first novel with this author,second book in the Peter Ash series.  As a female  book had the appropriate level of cation, gore, and it also goes into Peter's struggles with post war psychological issues that pagued him through out this novel.  It made him real in a two dimensional novel!  There were some real raw emotional moments with many of the characters in the book.  It kept you guessing to the end, but the ending was rather unusual twist to close the story.  Great pace, took me less than 2 days to read it, as it was hard to put down, depth of story not a good as others I have red, but enough to keep you hooked.  Sure, look forward to reading the next one, nd to cut u- with the first book!",positive

"The only thing wrong with AFTER I’VE GONE is the lack of suspense--the plot is given away by the publisher’s teaser description.  To wit, a young woman (Jess) opens her Facebook timeline, only to read memorial tributes posted by her father and friends regarding her untimely death.  Only she can see the posts--eventually she realizes that they are dated 18 months in the future.<br /><br />The story progresses in a sort of dual fashion.  Jess’ life moves forward (she meets a man, marries him, and gives birth to his son).  The Facebook posts also move forward (providing details of when she died, of her funeral, and finally of how she died).  Jess’ story is an interesting story, about friendships and other loving relationships.  Importantly, it’s not burdened with a lot of angst.  Jess is paying attention to what’s going on in her life, and to the mysterious Facebook posts, but she is taking things one day at a time.  She doesn’t act on the posts until some sort of action becomes imperative.<br /><br />This is a well-written novel, with well-developed characters.  There’s no supernatural stuff, except for the future Facebook posts, and the story contains a valuable caution for young wives and still-dating women.",positive
"I have a hard time placing my finger on why I disliked this book so much. I will try, but overall, I disliked it much more than I can even convey. So much of the book was just the author talking about herself. I felt like the first two chapters were spent with her trying to tell you why she is the expert, despite her not having much to say. When you finally get into the “meat” of the book, all the advice simply boils down to clean eating, with some Bible verses thrown in to make it a Christian approach and not the approach of most other diets on the market. There isn’t enough information in the book to consider it more than just a basic intro to clean eating, which you can probably get for free from bloggers if you just look up the term “clean eating”. There are some recipes in the book but none that are really revolutionary or even more than basic.<br />If you’re looking for this info, Trim Healthy Mama does a better job and has a more unique approach.",negative

"Good story about a family and the effect on the entire family when one member is unexpectedly hurt.  I thought the author did a good job of realistically portraying the emotional reactions of each family member during this life-changing event and portraying how the experience is different for each of them.  He explored the issue of survivor's guilt, including touching on risk-taking behavior.  His male characters were well developed and real but he also did a good job etching both the determination and grittiness of strong women as well as portraying their emotional vulnerability.  All-in-all, I really enjoyed this book.  The story flowed well, was taut and I wasn't disappointed at the conclusion.  I look forward to further novels from Tim Johnston.",positive

"This story starts with a strange gladiatorial fight, but then jumps to a class of girls being trained up to join the Mystical Slayers.  There are hints that the world is under a one company order, but the explanations made no economic sense.  (not a huge surprise as most of the anti-corporate stories lack a real understanding of how business works, and this story had clear anti-corporate plot threads.)<br /><br />And that resulted in a world that I'm not sure the author had defined in his mind.  Honestly, I couldn't get the characters because the whole plot felt like it was just floating away from the shore on a rip current.  It hadn't been given a foundation to tie the plot to something.  I had little to no clue what the first fight was about, and then we jumped in time and space without an explanation or any idea of what the fight was about, for, or who won.<br /><br />I can't even say that the idea was good.

"Genetics plays a part in more than just inherited diseases.  However, this book is a compilation of essays told from the viewpoint of those who either have or their children have a genetic disease such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, Crohn's disease, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), BRCA1 & 2 (breast cancer), Schizophrenia, etc.<br /><br />Through these stories I learned that most people with Alzheimer's die of pneumonia, many Down syndrome children usually end up with Alzheimer's, and the Schizophrenia gene can be traced mostly to Ireland.<br /><br />There are 16 personal stories. Some are clearly written, such as Isabel and Anabel's story on what it was like to live with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Other stories are not as well told or appear to ramble a bit in a nonsensical way. Either the disease was not described or the story vacillated between past and present or used technical jargon to the extent that I found it confusing to follow. For example, the first story told by Kelly who had Huntington's disease never bothers to describe what that disease is really about. I think the author should have prefaced each story with what each disease was so there would be a frame of reference.<br /><br />On the other hand, some stories disturbed me.  There were a few stories of families with a strong possibility of passing their family disease onto their children who decided to have children anyway knowing the suffering it would cause that child.  Of course, having children is a personal choice but I was saddened by the choice they made. In some cases, families just kept quiet or ignored the possibility that they had a disease; that also was disturbing to me because the choice to stay ""unaware"" of such a disease does not make one innocent.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I give ""The Story Within"" 3.7 stars.  The essays enabled me to get into the mind and daily life of those who have a family history of genetic disease.",positive

"The book goes like this:  Read a paragraph or two, scroll through 3 to 4 pages of thoughts and 2 to 3 pages pages of “character sheet”, read another paragraph that sums up the last 5 to 8 pages, rinse repeat with each chapter.<br /><br />The book is long but could be reduced to a large multi page pamphlet or small newspaper.  Not much happens to advance the overall story of the series or the character himself.  There is no growth or improvement personality or persona wise, just more stats and amazing power upgrades.<br /><br />I read this series at advice of another author I enjoyed.  While this series was more mechanics heavy then my usual preference in litrpg, the inner dialogue that summarizes the stats was a nice change.  The overall story of Mist and his village was enjoyable.  But this book was rubbish with a side of please move on.<br /><br />I feel like the author was pressured to produce a story but couldn’t figure out how to get from the end of book 7 back to the Land, so made up a bunch of fluff and filler to 1-power up the MC without trying, and 2-make poop jokes like a 5 year old hopped up on spiked kool-aid.

"Beverly Cleary’s books were some of the first ones I read independently. The Art of Ramona Quimby brought back so many memories of these books. When the editions illustrated by Tracy Dockray came out, I did wonder if the updated, modern illustrations would work with the original book texts, many of which were written in the ‘50s and ‘60’s. I was unaware until I read this book that yet another edition of Cleary’s books had been released in 2013.. It seems to work; children are still grabbing these books in 2020!<br />The Art of Ramona Quimby focuses on the one character of Cleary’s that had books published about her from the 1950’s all the way in to the ‘90’s. The author did a marvelous  job of taking readers through the decades with  this beloved little girl.  The letters of correspondence between Cleary and the first illustrator, Louis Darling, were a special added bonus. I would recommend this to anyone who has ever enjoyed  Ramona’s adventures through the years.<br />I hope Anna Katz will someday write another book about  the art of some of Cleary’s other characters!<br />Thank you, Netgalley, for providing me with a free copy of this outstanding book.

"I must begin by stating that I have the highest regard for the wisdom contained within this reference—and that only serves to make the publisher’s poor choices for its physical presentation exponentially worse! It would be impossible to find a more comprehensive and thorough volume on cooking and the content of the book from cover to cover cannot be faulted. But all the invaluable information within its hallowed pages becomes less than worthless due to the extremely reader unfriendly formatting! I purchase cookbooks to use, not to sit on a coffee table as decor! Publishers elected to print this edition in too small font which is difficult to read under ideal circumstances and next to impossible to follow if actively attempting to follow a recipe. They also chose to widen the pages which would not be a major issue, except that the paper is of a thin, insubstantial thickness. This is a book that should be sturdy enough to use for a lifetime of frequent use! I would rather pay more for a functional version broken into multiple volumes if necessary than to be stuck with this massive paperweight! Honestly, to print a reference of this caliber in such an inferior and unusable manner borders on sacrilege! Irma must be rolling over in her grave!",negative
"René Redzepi is a Danish chef who co-owns Noma (now Noma 2.0), which is a restaurant in Copenhagen, Denmark.  He invited the author on his quest to discover the best culinary flavors throughout the world and to publish this book about the effort. These discoveries, such as the worlds best mole, came at a price. He closed Noma (1.0) in order to create pop-up Nomas in Japan, Australia, and Mexico.<br /><br />Most of this culinary story takes place in Mexico, whose eatable delicacies Redzepi loves. What I learned about this quest is the difficulty of foraging and procuring ingredients to make the best and most astonishing culinary delights possible.  The author is a gifted writer in being able to weave  a story that is somewhat lacking in substance but which I still found to be incredibly enjoyable. It is a journey of discovery of what the natural world can offer up that will excite our palate and also about the man and his disciples that formulate these culinary creations. The difficulty in finding superb ingredients and the stress associated with their use is front and center throughout this text.",positive

"I read for enjoyment and as long as the story line grabs me, I don't spend a great deal of time analyzing it. This one definitely grabbed me and held me until the end. However when I spend $7.99 for a book, I expect it to be edited! I expect it to be professional. I would think that the author should be ashamed to charge for something he didn't bother to have edited. Did he even proofread it? Doesn't seem that he did.  Very disappointed. This should have been free, or at the very least, a $.99 book.",negative

"This ""book"" reads like something that belongs on the Sunday comics page directly between Prince Valiant and Zits.  The author exhibits a sesnibility for ancient history about as deep and lasting as newsprint.  The iPod-cellphone-gizmo crew will swallow it down with everything else that's a half-nanometer thick and pass on to the next thing.  ANYONE with a genuine affection and empathy for alchemy, for Flamel, for Dee and for the ancient deities will be wincing every alternate paragraph.  DO NOT give it to a teenager you care about: they are better off with candid misinterpretations of ancient wisdom rather than this masquerade.  Ugh!",negative
"This a beautiful book for the preschooler in your life. I picked this particularly for when my 4 year old grandson was going to be visiting me this month for me to share with him. He loved the large colorful pages and was mesmerized by the story of Freeda the Cheetah. He asked me to read it 2/3 nights he was here last week and even asked me afterwards, when he was home, when I could read it to him again. Just a great children's book and I highly recommend it for having some one on one time with your children and grandchildren. I am saddened by the fact that many children today never share the joy of physical books any more, hopefully this book may make a difference in their lives. I am anxiously looking forward to the day when he can read the book to me!",positive

I know Lao and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Thailand so I'm familiar with the cultures. The mystery is an interesting one and the portrayal of Laos in 1977 is fascinating.  I took Lao from professors from Laos and learned their version of Lao history.  This book is a pleasure for mystery lovers and Lao fans alike.,positive
"The book “Confessions of a Wild Child” offers a glimpse into the background (i.e., childhood) of Lucky “Saint” Santangelo. Initially I thought this was going to be a great read, but it actually turned out to be ……exhausting. “Lucky” is definitely a handful and gets into more trouble before she was even 16 years old than the average teen. With the exception of knowing that she discovered her murdered mother’s body in the pool and loves her brother, I didn’t remember much about Jackie Collins’ Lucky (it’s been a few years). Confessions chronicles Lucky’s misspent youth. We see her: escaping from various boarding schools; trying to get her father (Gino the Ram) to realize she should take over the business even though she is a girl; exploring her sexuality (i.e., going “almost” all the way with boys); places herself into dangerous situations; fleeing the country with no money and surviving in Paris; protecting her gay brother (Dario); and proclaiming her unrequited love for Marco (her father’s close associate). The story ends with Gino arranging Lucky’s marriage to Craven Richmond, the awkward son of a Senator.<br /><br />Personally, I was a little disappointed…although I know the story is dated….Lucky was involved in some very risky behavior (i.e., riding with strangers, taking up for a puppy that is being beaten by two losers). I know the story took place in the late 80’s (hence the fashion and cocaine references), but marrying off your 16 year-old daughter (the same week of her 16th birthday) to a 21 year old is in poor taste. While the backdrop of a story in Vegas should be exciting, I found the whole storyline to be a tad forced. Still, I plan to re-read “Lucky” because I don’t remember it, and hopefully it will be better than this one and make sense.",negative
"Just finished this last night and thought it was a great book, gives a very real insight to what its really like as a mom, the ups, downs and gross out factor. Only complaint would be that it seemed kind of choppy at times but that isn't because of her writing style, more so due to the blog excerpts inserted in with the rest of the story, which is the point of the book so totally fine, I just wasn't used to reading books in this style so it took a bit to get in the swing of it and read steadily at first, but would def recommend to other moms",positive

"Borrowed this from my library thinking it'll be a ""new kid in school"" plus ""how my illness affects me"" coming-of-age tale with a scoop of ghosts. Sounds great, right? Well, what I got was a lackluster story some white woman wrote under the guise of ""disability representation"" because she was too much of a coward to stand by her exotification of Día de los Muertos. So happy I did not waste my money on this.<br />And if you really care about the sacred holiday, I suggest you borrow/buy books written by people who actually have cultural ties to it. It'll be way more informative instead of performative like this book.",negative

"CADAVER & QUEEN is the weirdest historical mystery/romance that I’ve ever encountered.  Set in Victorian England, it tells the story of a female student’s first year at a medical school renowned for its research and development into Bio-Mechanical soldiers.  Bio-Mechanicals are re-animated cadavers, sometimes fitted with artificial limbs or cadaver limbs, that are able to perform menial tasks (e.g., mopping floors).  The hope is that the Bio-Mechanicals will be able to replace live soldiers in warfare.  (All this is fiction.)<br /><br />In the novel, the student (Lizzy) and a couple of male friends explore the complicated buildings and secret passages of the school (Ingold), which occupies a former Cistercian monastery in isolated Yorkshire North Riding.  They are attempting to solve the mysterious disappearances of wounded-soldier patients and village locals.  What exactly are their medical professors doing with the cadavers they collect?  What are the professors plotting with regard to the ancient and ailing Queen Victoria?  And what is happening with a certain almost-human Bio-Mechanical (Victor), who is unusually violent but appears capable of conscious thought?<br /><br />The novel starts slowly, but once you get into the premise, the book has a certain horrid fascination.  The possibility of a romance developing between Lizzy and Victor (can it really be happening?) is mighty creepy.  However, the mystery plot is decent enough, and all the strange loose ends get tied up at the end.",positive
"I am bewildered as to how to describe this book. I do not even understand the purpose of this text other than to say that the author describes macabre details as if reading a photograph. Almost every paragraph is a new &#34;experience&#34; for the reader.<br /><br />For example, in one paragraph the author writes about a kitten that was killed by a dog, that was then autopsied by the pet owner, and found to have internal organ damage. The author goes on to describe how the owner then photographed the dead kitten with sunglasses, a cigarette in its mouth, etc.<br /><br />In another paragraph in a different chapter, the author talks about someone who told her a story about his father who was shouting for help while drowning and his family laughed and ignored him because they thought the father was clowning around since he was a trickster. He drowned, of course. A few paragraphs later in the same chapter, is an excellent description of how waterboarding is done.<br /><br />The short narratives go on and on throughout the book. I just started reading this and stopped at page 30. I browsed other paragraphs in the book but it was more of the same disaster type stories (death, starvation, prison, etc.). This is not a book I want to read further. The subject matter is incredibly gruesome to me and the text is all over the place as the reader moves from one varied narrative to another. I do not feel I am learning anything at all from the text even though this is sadly a work of non-fiction.<br /><br />On the positive side, it is apparent from the bibliography that the author did a lot of research before producing this text. In addition, she writes exceptionally well but the narrative is just a compilation of one ghastly detail after another with no continuity in-between.  This is definitely not a page turner for me although a select few might consider it a masterpiece.",negative

"Occasionally I finish a book that leaves me not wanting begin another, at least for a little while, because it really stays with me .I did not want to ruin the stirring feelings I had upon completing Nine, Ten. (This is out of the ordinary for me, as I normally start on another book the minute I finish one.)  It took me back to Before...My boys were four and two...and I remembered how different America was when they were small; on September 10th...before.<br />  Nine, Ten reminded me of what it's like to read historical fiction, good historical fiction, about the Titanic. When an author does as wonderful a job writing about a major event as Baskin does, you do not want to stop reading, even though you know what's coming. Even the author notes and  the acknowledgements  were heart- rending.<br />  I have already recommended Nine, Ten to several people. I think this book would be a wonderful way to teach others about 9-11.It will probably be a nostalgia trip for parents of today, most of whom will remember Before...and how it was so different.",positive

It is informative, beautifully illustrated and has many maps to help me get around as a single traveler. I have owned several Lonely Planet guides and I am never disappointed with the up to date and comprehensive information you get from them. It is convenient enough for me to carry in my purse, yet with enough information to be the only guide I will need. Kudos to Lonely Planet for another great travel guide!

My husband is a programmer and I thought this would be a good resource for him while he's visiting. After looking at it, I've decided it's too advanced for him. He's a strong reader, but it's more geared toward an older reader. I showed it to my 22 year old son, who is studying Information Technology at college. He found it interesting. He's way past Scratch, which the first section of the book is devoted to, but the Python and Web Technologies sections cover a lot of what he's learning right now.

"I'm a fan of British mysteries, and have read quite a few, which have been set in years past.  This is my first written by a British writer, taking place in present day.  The writing is just okay, the author got high marks for his descriptions of backgrounds (however, some told us 'way more than we needed to know, and went on 'way too long)  and the plot (not terribly original)  didn't capture my attention until I was 100 pages into it, at the point that I wanted to give up on the whole read.  For me, the biggest problem was that I didn't like the protagonist.  She seemed to have a chip on her shoulder, was always cranky and &#34;pissy&#34; about almost everything, enjoyed flouting authority and used people whenever it was to her benefit.  The few times she felt sad for someone or shed a tear, I wasn't buying it.  To like a book and feel an eagerness to get involved with the story, you have to feel some empathy or identity with the protagonist.  I felt none and I usually appreciate a strong female character.  Strong is good;  tough and bitchy is not.<br /><br />It was fun to try to figure out what the characters meant by &#34;pervy&#34;, &#34;you lot&#34; and &#34;piss&#34; (it seems to have multiple<br />meanings), but that wasn't enough.<br /><br />I won't be reading anymore about Jessica Daniel.  I didn't like her.",negative
"After the first few chapters, I was nearly ready to give up. The main character, was unlikeable. She had no redeeming qualities at all. But, the story is just like one of those sappy holiday movies on the Hallmark Channel where she goes through a quick transformation. And by the end of the story she has become a decent person. All this happens in the course of a few days. The book is fast paced and even though I didn't care for the lead, I was engaged and quickly devoured it. It's not realistic, but it was entertaining.",positive
"That's one of the tests for me - if I can put it down indefinitely and not long to pick it up.  Not Patterson's usual fast pace or intriguing villains either - I just caught myself not giving a darn about the story or the characters.  I was disappointed to find that the two parallel stories never came together at the end in one mighty ""Aha!"".  I was so disappointed that I went back and re-read some of the last portions, fearing I missed something.  And, please - don't give us that lame little insinuation at the end that we may see Alfred Brinkley again.  He's not interesting enough to reprise, believe me.  Well, the neat thing about Patterson is that if you don't like one book just wait a couple of months and you'll have another to anticipate, run out and buy, etc.  I have liked so many of his books, that I will be first in line for the next one - come July, and the one after that, come September.  We must have faith that one of these next ones will deliver the zing we have all come to expect. Sorry, Mr. P - this one fell flat - but tomorrow is another day!",negative

"Start by saying I love Lucas Davenport books. BUT this is not even close to the best of them. I miss all the people we are used to, Del, Shrake, Jenkins, Virgil, Sandy, Rose Marie, & even Weather (who I could do without) & the governor. The Bad Guys are given way too much time - they aren't interesting at all, unlike most of Mr. Sandford's criminals. The plot is very sketchy & pretty uninteresting. Letty is a little flaky as usual & that part was ok. It is worth reading but don't look for the usual ""can't put down until the last dog is dead"". It is easy to put down, but also easy to pick up again. So, I am again waiting for the next Prey book & am pretty sure it will be back to the best ever mystery series.

"Great fun and an excellent read.  Many years ago, when I was still in my teens, I put together a mixtape of country-related Elvis Presley recordings from the late '60s.  The songs included the likes of Guitar Man, You Don't Know Me, U.S. Male, Big Boss Man, Singing Tree, even Stay Away and Your Time Hasn't Come Yet, Baby.  I gave a copy to my dad, and he truly loved it.  Kind of bridged the generation gap of that troubled era and brought us closer together than we had been in years.  Pretty soon it wasn't just Elvis records we were sharing.  There was a whole new genre of popular music called country-rock: The Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo, Poco, Rick Nelson & the Stone Canyon Band, Linda Ronstadt, and eventually his favorites, Eagles.  John Einarson's ""Desperados: The Roots of Country Rock"" not only brings that scene gloriously to life, but it also brings a whole lot of personal memories back to mind.  The book is consistently interesting, informative, and filled with fun, facts, wisdom, and even a few surprises -- as well as some great quotes and sidebar stories.  I would actually love to see an updated version; too many years have passed since it was originally written.  Highly recommended to country-rock fans, regardless of age.",positive
"Eight topics from different contributing authors with eight very distinct views and ideas.<br /><br />What I liked about this book was that you did not have to start with the first chapter, which I didnt, but I went straight for ""leading through the rough times"".  Well, here I am in the worst recession (2008-2009, I hope) since the great depression and I wanted to know what inspiration I could get from reading this chapter: a lot, like you need to identify your key employees and how to keep them (well I kinda hope to think I am one of the important employees to them!), but it gave me a road map to see how my company was fairing in not only getting us out of this rut, but did they really think about it at all.  I am not to say that this book is the perfect road map, but it did get me thinking a lot.<br /><br />I then jumped to 'how resilience work' - hmm, it was worth reading: not just a chapter full of characteristics, but a more deep seated approach: call it humanity, spirituality, what you will, but the chapter got me glued to every page - does not happen with business books!).<br /><br />So that was how I read the book; jumping around as this recession sure gave me plenty of time to read the other topics: moving upward in a downturn, when growth stalls, leadership and psychology of turnarounds, finding your next core business, zeitgeist leadership and cutting costs without drawing blood (sorry I think all cuts draw blood).<br /><br />The book is less than 190 pages and it really was a fun read and I would not often say that about a business related topic.  You gets you thinking and that is what I like.  There is no road map, but a collection of shared experiences/ideas so that you know you are not alone in this and that someone has gone through it already.",positive

A lot of characters were introduced and I had to keep rereading parts to keep them all straight. But once I got into the story, I didn't have that issue any longer. There's a lot of FBI action. There were several different conflicts taking place.  It is pretty steamy at times, but that's not the main focus of the story.
