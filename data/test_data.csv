Review,Sentiment
"It is definitely not a watercolor book.  The paper bucked completely.  The pages honestly appear to be photo copies of other pictures. I say that bc if you look at the seal pics you can see the tell tale line at the bottom of the page.  As someone who has made many photocopies of pages in my time so I could try out different colors & mediums that black line is a dead giveaway to me. It’s on other pages too.  The entire book just seems off. Nothing is sharp & clear. There is what looks like toner dust on all the pages making them look muddy.  There are no sharp lines & there is no clear definition.  At least there isn’t in my copy.  And the Coloring Book for Adult on the bottom of the front cover annoys me. Why is it singular & not plural?  They usually say coloring book for kids or coloring book for kids & adults or coloring book for adults- plural.  Lol  Plus it would work for kids if you can get over the grey scale nature of it.  Personally I’m not going to waste expensive pens & paints trying to paint over the grey & black mess.  I grew up in SW Florida minutes from the beaches & I was really excited about the sea life in this. I hope the printers & designers figure out how to clean up the mess bc some of the designs are really cute. They just aren’t worth my time to hand trace & transfer them, but I’m sure there are ppl that will be up to the challenge.  This is one is a hard no. Going back. I tried.",Negative
"I bought it for the bag on the front so it paid for itself with that imo.  I haven’t started anything yet from it bc I’m still busy with other projects, but I’m really looking forward to starting some.",Positive
Updated: after 1st arrived damaged the replacement arrived in perfect condition.,Positive
"I love this book!  The patterns are lovely. I admit I’m not even following all of them to the letter. I am more of a free spirit.  I see the designs & take a look at the dimensions & just kind of wing it from there sometimes. lol. I’m 54 now & much less rigid in my arts & crafts than I was in my younger days when I would go to 6 stores trying to find the right threads or yarns. Lol. Those days are over!  Praise the Lord!  It’s a lot more fun now too.  As Bob Ross used to say- “Happy Mistakes!”  I make a lot of them sometimes, but I have found that the journey for me is a lot more interesting these days. Lol.",Positive
"Seriously one of only a few books they I have ordered from Amazon that has arrived in pristine condition. No bent edges, no buckled covers, no marred printing, no mysterious liquids, & no folded pages. The book is lovely, but my continued pet peeve with books like this is the manufacturer’s insistence of printing on both sides of the damned pages. So you can’t frame one picture without losing the image on the other side. It’s annoying.  I’d gladly pay more for a book with printed images on only one side & on watercolor grade papers.  So instead I guess I will be yanking these out, scanning them, & printing them on my own watercolor papers so that I can use the images on both sides.  The paper just does not hold up to a lot of media of you choose to use both sides in my experience. Ever.  I believe I now own all, but one of JD books & I will be buying it for myself for Mother’s Day. Lol. I love her art. I love her stamps. I love this book, but I’m knocking a star bc printing on both sides is stupid imo when the book is meant to be used to create more art.  Why limit the artists by making us choose which side to use for framing or which side to use if we choose to cut one side up & decoupage it onto something. We are then paying double for half a book!  It’s insane imo. Give the buyers options other than creating more work like I mentioned with the breaking the book apart & scanning it for personal use & printing it on better papers.",Positive
"I love this book.  I was not blessed with artistic talent. Music yes. Drawing no. Lol. I have several of her books now & I fully intend to buy more for myself, my 5 kids, & my grandkids. We all love arts & crafts & these books are just awesome. My only issue is I haven’t brought myself to work in them yet! Lol. I use a separate sketch book!  I’m old school. Taught never to write in books or deface them. The only time I do is if the grammar or punctuation is wrong or the idiot author has now said the killer has blue eyes where previously they said green. Plot errors drive me crazy. Those times I will fix the mistakes. Lol.  So I’m hoping to bring myself to actually work & draw in the books. Lol.  I’m hoping she makes a lot more of them.",Positive
Can't wait to try these patterns!,Positive
Her books are great and I love making the animals!,Positive
"If you're looking for a comprehensive resource for NCLEX prep, look no further...this book is fantastic. Extensive topic coverage complete with rationales for every response. Prefer going online to take quizzes? No problem this book's got that, too. (Although the content online is a tad bit confusing to navigate, once you figure out how to get to the quizzes section, you won't forget.) I have several books for review and this one is my personal favorite. Some of my professors loan this text out to students, but I prefer 24/7 availability in my own home! :-) Happy studying, future nurses!<br /><br />UPDATE: I saw sooo many reviewers having trouble getting to the online content to take system-specific quizzes that I decided to post instructions here on how to get to the right place.<br /><br />1) Go to the Pearson Pegasus log-in page once you've set up online access, and log in.<br />2) Click on the book title on the left side of the website.<br />3) On the next page, on the left side near the top, you will see a menu bar that has the following options: ""Today's View, Course Content, Grades, Communicate"". Look just BELOW this menu bar and you will see the following options: ""View All Content, Course Calendar, Learning Objectives.""<br />4) Click on Learning Objectives.<br />5) On the left side, you will see the following options: ""Client Need, Topics Areas, Integrated Process.""<br />6) To take quizzes related to your system or topic of choice, click the plus sign for ""Topics Areas"".<br />7) Click on your system of choice.<br />8) On the right side, there are several options for that topic of study. Scroll down to the bottom-ish. You will see a heading called ""Self Study"" for that topic of study. Click on it.<br />9) A separate pop-up window will appear so that you may begin your quiz.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to comment below. Note that the online quiz portion only works with Internet Explorer and certain versions of Firefox, but not with Chrome.",Positive
I waned to like it but its just...  meh... not using it in my nursing. Have found better items. Will donate,Negative
Sweet bookplates!,Positive
"I bought two packs of postcards- thinking 60 would be plenty, but I have to tell you everyone that has seen them has asked if I have more?? They are all different book covers, so the variety is nice! Works as a cute gift too! Highly recommended.",Positive
I bought these and the Nancy Drew postcards(also listed here on Amazon). My daughter wanted a ND party for her birthday and these work great as simple thank you cards! Super cute and sweet for anyone of any age! I am buying more just to have on hand. Highly recommended.,Positive
"Only read and believe things you want to see come true. Focus your attention on stories that uplift and inspire a greater future. The author meant well, but has his own journey and beliefs to conquer to see clearly.",Negative
I've been listening to Brian and Jenn's music for 13 years.  They've always been such an encouragement.  It meant a lot for someone in this position to write his story honestly.  For some reason I think that you need to be perfect for God to use you.  And I fear what people will think if I talk about hard things I'm going through.  Thank you Brian for taking the risk.,Positive
I love the continuing story of My Travel Friends and the beautiful illustrations! There are 37 pages and the print is clear and easy to read! I love the discussion questions on the last page. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs! We will read the whole series. My family loves these books!,Positive
My kids and I love this book. It is colorful and has a good story. There are 39 pages and the print is clear and easy to read! This is the 1st book in a series of 7. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs! My kids are learning to do the right thing and make good choices! We will read the whole series. Love it!,Positive
The colorful pages and decorative text is fun to look at and beautifully created. The My Travel Friends Series are wonderful books that my whole family love. There are 37 gorgeous pages and beautiful illustrations! Recycling and keeping our water clean is a story I love to read to my kids. The interactive app really brings the book to life with voices and songs!,Positive
I love it.,Positive
I love it.,Positive
Cute!,Positive
Nothing new for a collector of Antique Jewellery!  Pretty much all the pieces on this book have been in other Jewelry books!!!  And the funny/annoying thing no prices of the auction prices are listed either.<br /><br />Sad to say I was really disappointed with it.  Buy a used copy if you really want it!,Negative
Loved this book....as a financial advisor  I loved the link to jewels  as currency  and the history. I  wish it had  pictures of shiny objects!,Positive
"My first read with this author.  The story line was interesting, great character development.  The chapters are short and weave in and out the story as it touches the lives of characters.  While getting close to the end, I put the book down for a week because I didn't want the book to end - it kept me hooked.  I don't do that with books, leave it alone to take small bites but this one I did.  The author herself is interesting; she is a journalist and served as a BBC news presenter.  Story telling is her way to decompress from the crimes she reported and reports on which I find truly remarkable and commendable.  She's a great author, contributor and story telling artist. Thanks Teresa Driscoll.",Positive
"This is one of a series of books, very interesting and uses one's imagination well.  Love the old photo's that are weaved into the story.",Positive
Interesting read and the old photographs add to the story.  Loved it so much I purchased the next two stories so I could continue the journey,Positive
Just what I was looking for.  Thank you.,Positive
"I was locked in within the first chapter! As a 75 year old woman living with a husband who lives for Sci-Fi, I chose this book only  after reading excellent reviews--yet with a bit of skepticism.<br />Wondering how this writer could do Sci-Fi differently with all that's out there, I wanted to see if I would recommend it to my husband--especially since it seemed to be targeted for young adults.<br />It was an immediate page turner! Such an unusual & exciting journey, it had me sitting on the edge of my seat.  I truly hope it will become a movie! My husband has already started it.  And I can't wait for the next book to be available!!!  Write ON dear author!",Positive
Every single recipe is WONDERFUL!!,Positive
"At 74 years of age the title of this book made me look twice.  What a wonderful surprise inside. It is filled with hope, understanding and truth--something we all can use a little more of at this time. I definitely can relate to it and can see why young women will love it too!  I plan to take mine to our women's Bible study this Thurs to share with my study group. I'm hopeful that the author will continue writing similar devotionals for other books in the Bible. This book is a pleasure to pick up for a brief moment on the run or to sit back and enjoy with a cup of coffee in a comfy chair.<br />Yes! I highly recommend it to all women! More please...",Positive
Enjoyed the story and exposure to the country's people and culture. No matter the area the ugliness of human nature always rests it's hard and we need warriors to stand in the gap till Jesus comes.,Positive
Need to pay attention to what is happening in the world today!,Positive
Loved it,Positive
This book is beautifully written and easy to read. Matthew Perry is more than just the funny guy. He struggles with never feeling like he is enough. What a roller coaster to read. I hope he is doing well and lives the rest of his days in happiness.,Positive
"The name of the book implies a good fantasy story. While there is a unicorn in the book and a wizard…I found the book extremely boring. I rarely do not finish a book, but I did not finish this one.",Negative
Love it! So cute and definitely keeps my little one busy :).,Positive
Love love love this book,Positive
"Was a gift, she loved it",Positive
I got the book but cd is missing! !!,Negative
"This book is dumb, maybe worth $0.50 certainly not $2.00 you could easily find this in a dollar store and prob even better, there are 4 cupcake pictures and a few stickers.. not sure what I was expecting but this was definitely a disappointment",Negative
Always a good read.,Positive
"All my grandkids ( ages 3, 2 and 1) just love the Bizzy bear books. We have 3 and will be getting more.",Positive
"Nice book, but some of the slides are a little tough to get open.",Positive

"I bought this book awhile ago to keep at my house for my grandchildren and came back to get another one for my grandson to keep at his house. I love this book.The artwork is wonderful, the story is so fun. My granddaughter loves to look for all the animals and pick them out and count them. You can't go wrong buying this book!",Positive
Every time I buy something from Amazon I try to include a book for my Grandkids. I'm trying to build a little library for them. Where's Spot? is a cute book and I'm looking forward to reading it to them.,Positive
As usual I am enjoying my latest Uncle John's book. I hate to end my old one but always enjoy starting a new one.,Positive
My wife is the biggest Bob Ross fan and just LOVED this coloring book. Very therapeutic and satisfied both the kid and the artist inside of us!,Positive
"I used this book to hike two trails this last weekend and it was very helpful for me (1st time to Shenandoah).  The pocket size was awesome to bring along on the hikes.  Its very light.  I also used it to pick which day hikes I wanted to do.  I used it a couple times during the hikes to read the descriptions and make sure I was still going the right way as many different trails intercross as some point.  The GPS coordinates also helped for us to arrive at the parking areas, especially for Whiteoak Canyon Trail that has an entrance not off of skyland drive and we had no cel phone service.  I'd definitly recommend this book.  It would make a great stocking stuffer around Christmas time.",Positive
Ver y nice book,Positive
I like it ver y much,Positive
Hard to get through was very disappointed with this book it was as if it was written by a fan with a crush on Anita.,Negative
"Many characters, many bodies, many clues, many opinions.  An interesting book, but difficult to follow if you cannot read in one or two sessions.",Positive
A disappointment in that I did not enjoy it as much as the author's first novel &#34;Child 44&#34;.  But still an interesting read.,Positive
"Used these cards through 3 semesters of A/P.  Very helpful, makes study a little easier.  Cards are divided by body system and color coded making them easy to keep together.",Positive
"Cool Wind's Gate by Wayne Bernard Sr.<br /><br />Many books and stories  written about the  antebellum  south and Louisiana in particular,  usually  tell one of two tales... a life of ease and prosperity  on a  grand plantation or the atrocities committed against those same men and women in bondage whose slave labor enabled the life of ease and prosperity.  Cool Wind's Gate though, while still set in pre-civil war Louisiana, gives a different accounting, a better way that could have been, one that I wished as I was reading it were true.<br /> The story of Cool Wind's Gate grew out of the belief that slavery  was wrong.  Mr.  Clem Collins of Wisteria plantation  knew that to simply liberate his slaves wasn't enough.  Without a means to care for  their families and lacking protection from the prejudices and cruelty of the outside world  it would do little good to set them free to starve or worse.  He had  a plan though, a broader vision of how a good life could be had by everyone.  A life filled with well-earned respect, dignity and love.  And Clem had Will Trahan, who would see to it that the vision of self-sufficiency and autonomy would become the reality.<br /> Cool Wind's Gate is written simply in a straightforward way.  I would have liked  more descriptive features  of the book's characters,  but at almost 900 pages,  the author gives us a very authentic story.",Positive
"This series was requested by my grandson, who is 10 years old.  I never say no to a book and Amazon makes shipping to far away grandchildren super easy.  Books arrived quickly and grandson is very happy with his gift.",Positive
I have been looking for this particular copy of HW.  Glad to have found it. Arrived in good time and in good shape.,Positive
"I purchased this book when it first came out.  I was initially pleased and made place mats by using one of the patterns. They came out well and I had no problems.  I recently completed a warp to make Serendipity, one of the more attractive patterns featured in the book. I reviewed the directions for threading but counting up the number of ends I would need and comparing the count with the pattern in the book I had a different count. I recounted several times and even tried several ways of adding things up but my end count remained the same. I assume that I misunderstood the sparse directions which were not clear.  It would have taken little effort to include clear instructions. I will not waste the warp, I will use for another project but it won't be from this book.",Negative
I am very pleased with this book. It is full of good easy to follow instructions on watercolor technique.,Positive
Good resource for simple fair isle patterns.,Positive
"Gorgeous book. There are a few patterns that I plan to knit. Packaged well, arrived I. Good time.",Positive
Great resource on history of  fair Isle knitting. I will put the Fair Isle patterns to good use.,Positive
"Great little golden book with the classic story we all know and love. Nice artwork as well. Very classic looking, would be a great addition to anyone's library and its a must read on Christmas eve!",Positive
"What can I say? Its Elmo and you can't get any cuter than that. The story is cute, the artwork is great, it features many of the other loved Sesame Street characters. Great board book",Positive
"Nice little board book, easy for smaller hands to hold. The story is decent, hard to tell the detailed story in a board book but Juilet David did a great job. I recommend this board book very much.",Positive
"This series is a great start to prepping! Great advice and tips. I really liked the part about bug out bags, Volume 4 I received this book at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review",Positive
A forever classic that every child should own,Positive
A classic everyone should own,Positive
I live in Nevada and now I know about the cool places to go see.,Positive
I got the book for my grand-daughter's research paper! I will read it next and pass it along to my other kids.,Positive
"Gorgeous coffee table book, chock full of absolutely amazing National Geographic photography. Beautiful landscapes, I particularly loved the northern lights since I am planning a trip to Iceland for 2019. This book would make an absolutely beautiful Christmas, Holiday, birthday, Mother's or Father's Day present for anyone who loves nature I have several NG books and each year they seem to get better and more spectacular!",Positive
"Absolutely amazing book. It is jammed with pictures and history and is truly impressive. This matches up to the standards of the Life series of picture book, with incredible never seen before photography and facts. This would make a terrific holiday present, especially for the WWII veterans in your life. But honestly, I have a son in the military who is in his early 30's who would love this just as much or even a younger child to show them the horrors of war. It makes a great coffee table/conversation piece book. I definitely recommend this for yourself or for someone you love.",Positive
"Excellent read by one of my favorite authors of all time Winston Groom (author of Forest Gump and the Aviator). I love reading history books, particularly American, and figured with the title of this book and with the author who wrote it, I could not go wrong. Nice size book, larger type (for my middle aged eyes) and once I started, I could not put it down. I read each General on individual days and I learned more about them then I ever knew from anything school books (or television) had ever taught me. I was particularly enamored by the colorful piece on General Patton. This would make a great gift for someone or just buy it for yourself.",Positive
"Absolutely wonderful book of two treasure hunters who set off to investigate and discover a pirate ship. Easy read, I found it next to impossible to put down. Robert Kurson tells a little known tale of intrigue and you almost feel like you are reading a fictional account with the way the wonderful story telling proceeds. I am now hooked on Kurson's writing style and intend to pick up Shadow Divers on Amazon as well. I could go on more, but in reading the other reviews on here, there is really little new to add. Great read, entertaining, will keep you mesmerized from start to finish.",Positive
"I travel a lot. Have been to Rome three times and I am always looking for new places to explore. This National Geographic Traveler guide to Rome is incredible. I love these guides better than any other (think Rick Steves). They are comprehensive, colorful and all inclusive with a variety of maps and places to visit off the beaten track. I am returning to Rome again in November of this year and this guide will be with me all the way. Kudos to National Geographic, best tourist guide on the market today!",Positive
"Trieste is one of the most amazing books I have read in ages. Normally, I do not like fictional accounts of historical events (given that the lines are usually blurred between reality and the author's spin on the truth). But Trieste is different. It is well written and the reader feels like they are in Italy during World War II and searching for Haya Tedeschi's son she had with a Nazi SS officer. Truly an emotional account, the reader is thrust back in history to one of the most horrific times one can imagine to be living in Italy. I would love to find the time to read this again as I think the read will be even better the second time around. I truly recommend Trieste to anyone who loves non-fiction and love/family stories. Kudos to Dasa Drndic",Positive
"I have been traveling to Italy at least once or twice a year for the last 5 years and I am hooked on the language, culture and people. This travel guide is great. Having visited most of the main cities several times (Rome, Florence, Venice), I was looking for a guide to assist me in looking for off-the-beaten path sites. I love this Lonely Planet guide. It is informative, beautifully illustrated and has many maps to help me get around as a single traveler. I have owned several Lonely Planet guides and I am never disappointed with the up to date and comprehensive information you get from them. It is convenient enough for me to carry in my purse, yet with enough information to be the only guide I will need. Kudos to Lonely Planet for another great travel guide! I highly recommend it for anyone looking to rent a car and travel into some of the lesser known areas of Italy.",Positive
"Loved this book. Don't pay attention to what the others have written about it being boring. I enjoyed every page and cried like a baby several times throughout. If you are an animal lover and love true stories, go for this book. I can honestly say I liked it double that of Marley and Me and would highly recommend this to everyone. Great read, won't want to put it down once you start.",Positive
"I love the outdoors, animals, nature and true stories. This book encompasses the best of all of them. I found it to be truly inspiring and well written (to the point I couldn't put the book down and read it cover to cover). I highly recommend it to anyone who loves survival stories, true life experiences and animals (especially the glorious wolves). Great read for everyone, truly inspirational.",Positive
I actually made a pilgrimage to Israel in 2011 and used this book as a sort of a guide to the history and the legacy of the country and its people. I highly recommend this as a personal story which is relatable to anyone who wants to know more about their heritage and family. I learned a lot about this magnificent country and it was a very enjoyable read.,Positive
"Buyer beware. I guess I thought at $15 this would be a regular size book. Of course, shame on me for not looking at the dimensions. This is a small almost pocket sized book with limited information in it pages are small with large type most with black and white pics). I never would have purchased this had I paid attention to the specifications. I would return it, but I used it in my 4 for 3 package and if I returned it, I would lose out. Disappointing, terrible purchase.",Negative
"Will keep this a short and sweet review. What else can I say, it's a Frommer's guide! Chock full of reviews and tourist hints, Frommer's never seems to fail when it comes to tourist guides. I am planning a trip to Costa Rica this year and have been using this book to line up all my activities. Kudos to Frommer for coming through once again for me!",Positive
"I love John Grogan, he has always been one of my favorite writers. The Longest Trip Home is a book which almost anyone can relate to. Being from a Catholic-background family, I especially found the book to be relevant, heartwarming and brought me back to my childhood. There were moments I laughed and moments I cried, but most of all there were moments that brought me back almost 30 years to my childhood growing up in New York. Grogan sure knows how to tell a story. I absolutely loved The Longest Trip Home and will be making a stocking stuffer of it for my mom for Christmas!!",Positive
"Dolly Kyle is an amazing speaker and writer!  She is clearly brilliant and articulate; humorous and transparent.  If you open this book up, plan on staying up half the night because you won't want to put it down!",Positive
What a life she had! Queen Elizabeth led a very remarkable life and this book shows that in pictures and with some fun stories that anyone who respected her would enjoy.,Positive
"Rosemary Mosco is brilliant! She has such a way of making learning so much fun. This book along with her others is a must for anyone who loves birds, pigeons are a very misunderstood bird and Mosco does a beautiful job showing us why these birds are so very important! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves nature.",Positive
"Having worked with Remy in the past, this book was like reading into what made him what he is today. I enjoyed the book and as a military history major and time spent in the military it is one of those reads that would help leaders better understand the what, why, how and what can go wrong in fighting the insurgency or how they get established.<br />Hearts & minds are one thing, but getting a better understanding of time and effort to get to those is better served with knowledge. A very good book",Positive
"Overall a good book to help Instructors, Faculty and new Instructional Technologist with limited to mid-level Moodle Knowledge.<br />Pictures are represent what you expect to see in Moodle from a faculty member's perspective to allow you to build your course and get it up online ready to go.<br />Chapter 1 - Developing an effective Online Course<br />  -- Provides some reasoning on why and how regarding Moodle and teaching. It could provide Instructional Designers a reference to provide faculty who are questioning the process and over all course design.<br /><br />The book covers a wide variety of areas to assist the course development process and more importantly how you will then use the course to teach effectively to students. It doesn't get to far into the weeds so if you need that level of fidelity then this isn't the best book for you (Experienced Moodle users moving from 2.x to 3.x version).  Additionally, if you're experienced the beginning of each chapter on a bit of instructional design/pedagogy  might put you off. I personally like the reminders as an Faculty Developer and Educational Technologist. Sometimes you just need to review the how and why to get better.<br /><br />I like how the author has gotten into Workshops and Portfolios, two the least used modules I've seen implemented by faculty at 3 decent sized institutions. She provides explanations on why and how to use these sections to get most every one started and follow ups with examples on how to use them to further the learner's engagement<br /><br />It's a good starter book for Moodle course design and implementation. Don't count on reading cover to cover in a day or so. But each chapter allows the reader the ability to jump to an area you need assistance with.",Positive
Rebecca Zanetti will keep you guessing until the very end of her books. I hope there are many more Laurel Snow books in the works.,Positive
I enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to put down. You will find it hard to put down too!,Positive
I liked this story.  It held my attention and I hope that there will be a sequel so I can know what Maya does with her life.,Positive
The writing is so descriptive that I could picture everyone he described in my mind! I really like books that have continuing characters. It gives you a chance to get to know all the characters in depth. Keep it up Kel! Can’t wait to read Book #3.,Positive
Loved this beginner book on how to use up all of the faux cork sheets.  So many great gift ideas!,Positive
a page turner at its best  .. i couldnt put this book down .... I was upset that it ended  !!!  dont miss this one !,Positive

Not what I expected.  Great plot and storyline. Could not put the book down once it got going.,Positive
"I love the WunderKeys series.  I started with the preschool and continued into the kindergarten with my then 4 yr old student.  It was amazing how easy it was for him to understand and grasp the concepts.  Plus, he absolutely loved the games (with a few modifications). The games are a little tricky for someone so young so we simplified.  He loved them anyway and didn't know the difference and still grasped the concepts the games were teaching.  Each lesson is perfectly laid out and my little one rarely got bored, except for when he just would refuse to play ;)",Positive

"This book is a behind the scenes look at what could be happening within our legal system.  It gives new meaning to the phrase ""ambulance chaser"".  The characters were strong and engaging, the story fast paced and engrossing.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.",Positive
"I purchased this cookbook for ramen beginners to go with some earth friendly ramen bowls as a gift.  There are many easy recipes and lots of helpful info about making ramen in the cookbook.  It's a great starter just as the title would indicate.   Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6,000 reviews posted, viewed over 50,000 times, and over 24,000 likes.

"This is a great cookbook for Tolkien fans - an interesting collection of recipes and drawings.  Paperback, hard spine. The recipes seem to be doable and creative.  I purchased for my niece who is a huge hobbit fan - I think she's gonna love it.",Positive
"I purchased this cookbook for my niece who is a huge Tolkien fan.  It is a hardcover and is beautifully illustrated along with very edible and doable recipes.  She likes to consider herself as a bit of an adventurous foody and cook.  I think she is going to love this cookbook.  I am not a huge Tolkien fan, but love to collect cookbooks and I love this one!",Positive
"If you suffer from vestibular migraines, this cookbook is just a godsend.  There is super useful info - easy to read and understand and BONUS  - great recipes too. This is a diagnosis for me so I am busy collecting all the info I can.  This is the book I go back to again and again - especially right now when I am just learning how to live with this diagnosis. On the cooking section,  I need photos when I cook anything - and -  this  so much more than a cookbook - but when you get to the recipe sections the photos are plentiful and beautiful.  Lots and lots of them.  This book as a whole is worth every single penny.  As I get through some of the recipes I will check back in if it seems an update of my review would be helpful.  They seem reasonable for anyone who has a general understanding of how to cook - no julia childs or martha stewart like stuff as far as I can see.  I fold down corners of the recipes I want to try in all my books and this one is almost entirely folded!",Positive
I have a grandson who simply loves to have stories quietly read to him for hours and hours... I haven't read this story yet - but I did buy the hard cover.  It looks really good.  I also purchased Make way for Ducklings and Blueberries for Sal.  We live on the ocean and thought the moonjellies might be a fun ocean story.,Positive
"This story brings back happy memories with my great grandfather and reading this story to him, over and over and over again... he was so patient and kind.  This is sort of an East coast story.. but we have blueberries on the west coast too, they are just bigger and better. HA!  The story is fun and my grandson is going to love it.  I purchased the hard back - as all books should be in my opinion.  Can't wait.",Positive

"We are getting ready to take a trip around the USA in our retirement. We wanted to consider whether we might want to make it a permanent arrangement and ""follow"" the weather we feel like..  It will be fun to explore the options in research.  We also invested in an atlas - even though we all use google to get around, it's fun to look at a map you can touch - yes- because we are baby boomers.",Positive
"We are getting ready to take a trip around the USA in our retirement.  This book seems like a no brainer investment.  It will be fun to explore the options.

"I LOVE a spiral bound atlas... and it is really big... but the print is still really, really small when you really want/need to read it.  So, I am going to get a magnifier too.",Positive
I purchased this book as a gift for a remote gift giving party and it was so well received I thought I should have my own - so I purchased one of my own.  A nice dream book for when we can all travel again one day!,Positive
"My mom is a huge Danielle Steel fan and she loves the feel of a REAL book.  So, I ordered for her.  She is deep into reading it and says it's everything she hoping for.",Positive
Santa brought this to me this year  because we travel for work to a lot of different places all over the world and the US.  I am looking forward to using it as a fun reference for wherever we are headed.  Lots of full color pictures and easy to read paragraphs on ideas of what and where to go.  Hardback.,Positive
I bought this for a remote (virus this year) book exchange.  I happen to know there are several people who are campers/hikers in this group and thought this would be the great option.  I also added a firestarter to add to the fun.  The cookbook offers a lot of full color photos... most of the recipes are pretty fancy.  Something you would definitely be planning meals - not much of throw together meals with what you've got.  The book is hard backed and ridged spine.,Positive
"I lovely, big book - with a positive message of hope.  I actually purchased this book for holiday book exchange - all adults.. this may be considered a children's book - but only if you don't really read it.",Positive
"A lot of what you would expect... I wish there was a way to search/organize the recipes in the amount of time it takes to cook in the crock pot... that would help when you're looking at options - like the least amount of time at the front, the most time in the crockpot in the back?  I don't know.  There are 8 full color pictures in the center of the cookbook - I guess better than nothing, but I really love more pictures.  Really good - the book has a spiral back.  That means it will stay open as you're using it.  Down side, be careful, as the paper the book is printed is very much like a papertowel (meaning absorbs everything) matte, not shiny.. you get my drift...  I love cookbooks and own many - even though I also search online options as well.  Doesn't replace the cookbook in your hand in my opinion.  This one is good if you don't own ANY crockpot recipe books.",Positive
This great as a family recipe keeper and then make a gift of it.  The best part is the spiral binding which helps it stay open while you're using it.  The down side? If you want to consider it... there is no projection for the paper pages you're writing on while cooking - they are just plain paper that is not terribly thick.  I still like it as a keepsake.  I hope one of my grandsons will end up with it long after I'm gone - from my daughter.,Positive
"My 81 year old mom is a huge Jeopardy fan and in this time of quarantine I thought this might be a fun diversion once in a while.  It arrived in good condition, quickly (I have prime) along with other items I had ordered.  The spiral bounding makes it easy to keep the book open where you want it without struggle.",Positive
This is really more of a joke.. but I thought my daughter needed a smile during this time of pandemic and quarantine.  She loved it... but it's not really a training tool.. it's a smile.  Worth the smile.,Positive
Purchased for something different to entertain my 80 year old mom during this time of hanging out at home - she likes it - one of the best things about it is the spiral back -  which means it opens and stays open while she's using it.,Positive
Purchased for my 80 year old mom to have something different to do in these trying times.  She likes it.  Having a spiral bound back would have made it a five star experience.,Positive
I purchased this for my mom to have something different to do - she likes brain games.  I think one of the best things about this book is the spiral spine.  Makes it super easy to open and keep open.  Lots of different stuff to do.,Positive
"I wanted a cookbook that I could sit with my 4 1/2 year old and 7 year old grandsons and choose things to make...  There are several things I think will tempt them... I want to encourage my boys to try new things and have a part in the process of the cooking.  This book has wonderful full color photos on most of the book.  You ""eat"" with your eyes first... this is important - especially when trying to get kids involved.  I will update my review as we have tried a few things.  Why not 5 stars.... a hard spine... not a spiral  - which makes it easier to keep open...  *meh*... I do like the healthier recipes.  I didn't see anything that you needed a degree to get done - which is good cause we are trying to get kids involved here!  There are easy to follow step by step directions.  The 7 year old reads so he is going to jump on the details.  The 4 1/2 year old will like the photos.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful... and I do hope this info was helpful to you in some way!",Positive
Have an inherited 1989 Toyota 1 ton pickup.  This was an obvious &#34;need.&#34;  It is used... but something this old is probably gonna be. Eventually you're gonna need it.  Husband says it has the info we need and well help us to find the parts we need.  Truck only has 70k on it - in case you're wondering why in the heck would you want to work on it... ha,Positive
"First let me say that I am new to the vegan diet, so I have collected a handful of books I thought would help me... having said that - this cookbook has NO photos.  :(  But... it still has a long list of useful recipes.  Most are listed gluten free and soy free - if that matters to you.  At the top of each page and under the recipe name it tells you this info...  I haven't found any strange ingredients (meaning you can't find what you need at the local grocery store - as we live in a small rural town) and no super special pieces of kitchen equipment... so I consider that a bonus.  I am not a trained culinary chef and I manage to understand the process of these recipes... I am a fan of one pot cooking (in all fairness some of the recipes use more than one pot - but served in one bowl..), so this book appealed to me.  I like the Red Bean Gumbo (however I replace the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper as I am not a fan of green bell pepper and I omit the okra - not a fan of that either)...  very satisfying. In the book it mentions that &#34;gumbo&#34; is the African word for okra!  Hmm... I like gumbo... but sans the okra. haha.  In any case, I purchased this cookbook and a handful of others to help inspire me to try to eat vegan.  Now... if we could get them to add photos and a spiral back (to help keep the book open while you are using it in the kitchen) it would be a 6 star.  :)",Positive
"My husband is a type 2 diabetic and we wanted to explore the vegan diet option to help... First I will say that this cookbook has NO photos.  I am always a little disappointed by this, but seems like more and more cookbooks these days are photo-less.  :(  On the upside, there is a very good informational (in my opinion as a vegan newbee) forward in this book with useful info about substitutes and options... The recipes seem to be fairly straightforward (no culinary degree needed or super special equipment) and tasty.  I really love the chilled watermelon soup - it's more delicious than one might think. Wish the book had photos and a spiral back to help keep it open while in use, but even without that I think this cookbook is worth owning if you are interested in trying the vegan lifestyle.",Positive
"I am a Vegan beginner... so I was looking for cookbooks that were not too hard to follow and would offer some inspiration... this cookbook is great on all accounts.  So far, I haven't found anything too difficult or needing odd tools or ingredients so weird you can't find them...... so that's all a plus. It does say &#34;Easy Vegan&#34;... but just to be fair, I have found that vegan cooking can take a little more time for me as I am not accustom to it... yet...  I'm working on it.  One the best features in this cookbook are the photos!  So many cookbooks these days are without photos - which is not very inspiring - I mean - I get that the photos are expensive to add, but they make - or break a cookbook in my opinion.  One of our favorites is the peanut butter banana pancakes...  There are a lot of recipes using what you would expect... black beans, quinoa, lentils and the usual veggies and some nuts.  Honestly, if you're looking to venture into the possibility of a vegan diet, out of the 4 books I ordered, this one is the one I usually reach for.  Book and movie reviews are very subjective, and I get that.  I try to be as helpful as I can when reviewing such items.",Positive
"purchased to go with a lawn dice set as a gift at christmas for a group of 3 boys, 4yrs, 8yrs and 12 yrs.  They have every toy ever thought of and a lot electronics.  So the dice and this book were a departure.  However, I hear, they do play with the dice - the older boys read this book to try new games.  So, I consider this a win win win.  They are reading, learning new games, playing outside together and nothing takes batteries.  :)",Positive
"First read this to my daughter years and years ago when she was about 8....  Had an occasion to bring a book to girl baby shower where they asked for your favorite kid book.  I have always loved that the princess in this story did not &#34;need&#34; a prince to be happy.  A good lesson and a great story for all little girls.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, nor do I shy away from answering comments/questions.  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  My purchases are VERIFIED, FULL price and 100% independent.  As are my reviews!  They are fully my opinion, which could differ from yours - and that's ok.  Happy shopping!",Positive
"I am just a beginner and I find this book to very helpful so far.  There are some pictures, lots of recipes and a lot of useful in about canning in general.  I purchases a steam bath pot instead of pressure cooker (too much worry for me) and I learned it takes a bit longer using the steam bath, but still ok.  I really want to try to can my own organic tomatoes... AND some fresh caught Halibut!  As I begin to experiment I plan to update my review with any useful info.",Positive
purchased this and some others with colored pencils and pens for my (adult) daughter when she was recovering from a illness... she was thrilled.  She reports that it is relaxing... soothing... and chases the blues right away. Who would have known?  Anyway... she loved coloring as a child.. and apparently it's not such a bad thing to revert to some &#34;childish&#34; things once in a while... :),Positive
Bought these for daughter (33 years old) who is recovering from a minor surgery.  She used to love to color as a child and I thought it might be fun.  She was thrilled.  And reports that it is soothing and quite calming.  She doesn't get a LOT of time to do it with 2 year old and 5 year old boys but looks forward to it when she can.  I always update with any issues or other useful info.,Positive
"Got this book for my husband at Christmas.  He's always wanted to build a wood boat and he wanted several books to gather information and opinions.  This was one of two.  My husband really liked the information and photos in this book.  It arrived quickly and in good condition with some other items I had ordered.  It was not wrapped or protected, but it made it.  I will update with any further thoughts my husband might add",Positive
"Purchased for my husband for Christmas.... he has always wanted to build a wooden boat.  He loves that this one has some actual plans that are good to consider as a beginner.  He notes that you'll probably need a couple of different books to compare and gather info, but this one is an excellent one to start with.  I would consider that a 5 star review from him. I always update if there is anything important to report.  I will say the book arrived with a folded corner and not &#34;packed&#34; in any way, along with other items I had ordered.  That part was a little disappointing.",Positive
"Ok... I am a walking dead TV show fan.  Have watched all along and had never, before now, seen the comic.  I took the &#34;bait&#34; and tried this one (#1)... good marketing idea really... cause now I HAVE to get the rest.  If you're a dead fan you'll love them.  Wasn't sure I would like the &#34;comic&#34; book thing, but honestly it's awesome.  Especially if you were into them as a kid... I used read the vampire, werewolf, etc... type.  Not a fan of the &#34;super hero&#34; variety.  These really are fun and interesting even if you've already seen the TV show.  I was surprised. I say, try one.",Positive
"I purchased this book along with with a safari outfit for Easter for my 4yr grandson, along with all the accessories.  He LOVES it. They read it at night right now. I would take a peak at the open pages of the book to consider it for yourself.",Positive
"I purchased the book for my college bound nephew who is a huge jello fan, as part of his Christmas bag.  He is quite good at inventing his own jello creations, but I thought he might like this for inspiration.  It's a lovely hardcover book with nice color pics.  He's going to love it. Only thing that would make it 5 stars would be a spiral back so that it stays open when you're using it.  Just a personal preference.",Positive
I purchased the for part of my sister's Christmas bag.  She runs a private preschool/daycare.  She has raised dozens of children.  I just felt like she would really appreciate the positive thoughts and devotions in this book.,Positive
I purchased this as part of my sister-in-laws Christmas gift bag... empty nesting is tough and I thought she would like some encouragement.  I think she will really appreciate the gift.,Positive
"I purchased these pic books to share with my nieces and nephew some of their baby pics.  I will add them to their &#34;santa bags&#34; this Christmas.  The books are nice, tooled look. The flap is magnetic. Holds 48 4x6 pics as advertised.  I personalized each with a note on the inside cover.  I thought it was novel in this age of facebook and instagram.  We'll see what they think!",Positive

"I am a chopped fan and thought this would be an interesting addition to my cookbook collection.  I would have preferred a spiral back.  So it would stay open as you're using it.... thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  Other than that, it has some very interesting, doable recipes.  The pictures are lovely, however, not on every recipe, just FYI.  Some are little more involved than I will probably get, but it does have some recipes with some out of the usual ingredients that would be challenging to try.  Over all, it's a great cook book!",Positive
My grandson just turned 3 and is really loving having stories read to him as he learns to read himself.  Can you ever go wrong with Dr. Suess??  I don't think so.  Dr. Suess has a great way of &#34;speaking&#34; to imaginations.  Highly recommend all.,Positive

"This is one of the best SPAM cookbooks I've ever seen. Lots of beautiful pictures, suggestions on how to use SPAM.  Honestly, I am not a huge SPAM fan, but my husband and Mom are.  So I am trying. The cookbook has a spiral back and flaps that you can use to save your place in the cookbook.  There are some silly &#34;helpful&#34; cooking hints along the way, but that doesn't detract from the recipes and beautiful pictures!",Positive
I bought this book as part of the Christmas gift for my college bound niece who happens to be a S'more's freak.  The recipe book is quite nice and hard bound.  Lots of pictures and some great ideas.  I think she and her friends will enjoy considering all the S'more possibilites!,Positive

"Love skinnytaste website so knew I would love the book for air fryers...some of the recipes may be a little mature for my family but all in all, a great purchase that will definitely get your air fryer cooking",Positive
"Judging by toc alone, this would be a wonderful book, comprehensive, indepth, with examples. the author knows what to cover, or the topic of interest.<br /><br />Diving into it, many examples starts with no clue what it is for, what is it suppose to do, and what is expected output. Each example are broken down into pieces, sprinkled with sparse explanations, often doesn't help much. Come on, make some efforts, both Manning and Oreily do far better job on formatting code with pointed comments!!! This inflated the whole book into 700+ pages.<br /><br />On top of that, there are places I feel deserved a much greater discussion (such as concurrency), the book merely scratch the surface, this is true for many other topics as well. All in all, a big disappointment.",Negative
"My interest is mostly on deep and reinforcement learning, so the review is more pertinent to Step 6. I hate the textbook or technical book, which introduce something without proper context, notation explanation. You don't have to explain everything and cover every base - it is a fast moving area. But you do, you need to be thorough and/or self-contained. This chapter of the book is pretty much a pile of code and with lightly sprinkled narrative - which really teach you nothing. For beginners looking to learn, you can pretty much forget about it.",Negative
"I bought this book a while back, and never be able to really ""read"" the book. It has to do the author's way of explaining things. I think in the end - I deem that the way this Author uses the English and organizing sentences, it just tends to confuse people. It didn't help to simplify, just make complicated stuff as complicated as before, to me, that is the failure of a book.",Negative
"This book is very disappointing to me as a workbook: the exercise is EXCEEDINGLY repetitive. Please note I that I understand the importance of practice, but this one is going overboard, and it did so without really improving the understanding.<br /><br />As a trig book, it also misses a very important topic: graphing the sinusoidal functions, identifying period, midline, and amplitude. It has NONE of those. All in all, I think this is a LAZY collection of exercise and has 1/10 of the value that it is suppose to have.",Negative
"I don't know how should I put it after trying multiple times to dig into the book - in the end, my feeling is that the author really has a way to make simple things really complicated.<br /><br />The book throws both concepts and terminology around without giving much introductory context, and trying to be philosophical about it - too me, this is a really bad writing style.<br /><br />It is one of only a handful books on Solr, really disappointed.",Negative
Great addition to my collection of pop-up art books.,Positive
Interesting read of behind the scenes at the White house. The writer remains professional and doesn't reveal things that should be kept private. Talks about some touching moments living with the First Families.,Positive
"These were wet and smelly with some type of chemical.  They were in individual plastic bags which were sealed. The pillow cases were actually wet inside the packages and had a chemical odor. The outside packaging was dry.<br />I washed them by hand 5 times and each time the water was full of dye.  I've soaked them in vinegar and letting them air dry outside.<br />Even if they are alright now, I'd never use them indoors due to the unknown chemical.<br />Good chance I'll be returning these.",Negative
One of my favorite learning books. I've loaned it to many and purchased these as gifts. A totally new look at a favorite psalm. Much to learn in this book.,Positive
I've finally found help in managing my autoimmune problems in this book.  Well worth the purchase.,Positive
"Part mystery story, part inspired classic novel, interspersed narrative poem on life and love, infused with current themes made universal through come-to-life battles between 18th-centtury Puritans and Druid priestesses, Kaplan-Maxfield has penned a fascinating and beautifully complex oeuvre. For the literary, it's full of metaphorically rich prose flowing polished from his pen. For the young, it's a gothic mystery about love and longing and the quest to unravel life's mysteries while learning about love, ancestral teachings, power, and sacred truths--told through the eyes of modern-day Nikki and her ancestral mother Anne. For those not so young, it gifts the exciting rhythm of youth tempered by wisdom perhaps not yet acquired. It is also a tightly crafted contemporary novel with captivating depth about olden ways full of lessons for modern morass. Arcing through post-stormy-passages poetic rainbows reveal insights about men and women, science and religion, sacredness and truth, and learning to live with the constraints we are dealt.",Positive
"Having known the author in later years only, I was amazed to read Carol's memoir - what fascinating experiences, feelings, loves, decisions and situations in the span of her lifetime.  It is a life well experienced and in keeping true to knowing herself and expressing it in a beautifully written style.  While a reader may not know her personally, it is an intriguing memoir of the various times and pathways taken in a life.",Positive
"Delightful book, music.  Perfect for young chlldren, teachers and I (grandma) was singing the tunes in my car.  Loved the rain song for grandkids in Seattle.  Some time catch the author's course on the history of Rock & Roll.  Fascinating.",Positive
Well written book.,Positive
Great read! Goes nicely with All the light you cannot see...historically interesting and real...strong female characters with passion and perseverance,Positive
Tender and sweet...yet heart wrenching in its reality. Characters stay with you for days...you think of them as a part of your family.,Positive
"I received the first book as a present and had to purchase the 2 other books, so excellent and the writer must have worked years on those 3 books, the history of ther Germanic people in Northern Germany is so a live. I have not read this one yet, but I am sure the last of the 3 books will be fantastic.",Positive
"I got the First book as a gift, this swedish writer is so gifted, I could not lay the book down. I also had to buy book two and three, I love this series, you transfered in to the world of Germanic tribes and their customs, in the 1100 century and you get to go all the way to Jerusalem with the crusade, it has so many stories, about love and dead and war, I have to admire this writer. I read a lot but he must rank after 60 years of reading book in the top ten of writers. Excellent",Positive
"The Book is a good insight what happen in the History of Navoo and the Mormon People, I loved it.",Positive
I read this when I was little and got for my kids. I was reading through again and it is still fun. Just a nice quick read for your elementary student.,Positive
I really enjoyed this book all the way through. It makes me want to read novels again.,Positive
"This book by Thay is an incredible resource for teachers!!  It's a very unique book in that it has short and simple instructions for the various aspects of practicing mindfulness for adults/teachers (i.e. Walking, sitting, eating, etc. meditations), great ways to teach students, and has input how teachers from around the world have incorporated these practices into their classrooms demonstrating a wide variety of creative ways to engage students of all ages.  I have many of Thay's books and other authors on teaching mindfulness to students but I think this book will be my go to book from now on.  Wonderful collaboration and a terrific resource!!",Positive
Excellent book for teaching mindfulness to kids!!  Very thoughtfully and compassionately written.  I highly recommend this book!!!,Positive

I have read numerous books by TNH and this one was another wonderful book.  I tend to put sticky notes in my books when I want to go back and refer to important or meaningful points and this book is full of sticky notes!!  TNH (or Thay as his students refer to him) has such a simple way of explaining the dharma and useful ways to deal with all emotions.  A very helpful book and he's such a good writer!!,Positive
"I have been reading Thich Nhat Hanh's books for 20 years and love them all!  Peace Is Every Step was the first book of Thay's (what TNH's students call him-means teacher in Vietnamese) that I read and it was a gift from my brother.  This is a wonderful, easy to read book and a good introduction into mindfulness practice.  It's the kind of book where you can open it to any page and read the teachings.  Each subject is usually just a few pages long so it's the kind of book you can keep in the bathroom to read a little bit a time :-).  Thay has such a wonderful way of explaining mindfulness in ""easy to understand"" terms in this book.  Practicing mindfulness meditation has changed my life.  Be warned:  Once you start reading one of Thay's books, you'll be hooked!!  :-)).  He is an amazing poet, writer and such a gentle, warm, funny, compassionate ""being"" that is so full of happiness and joy.  I highly recommend this book especially for people that are new the mindfulness practice.  I have given a number of ""Peace Is Every Step"" books to friends as gifts.  My book arrived in wonderful shape-<br />Enjoy the book-and remember to enjoy every moment :-))-",Positive
"Nene Adams makes history sizzle!  I have never liked historical romances or mysteries!  Ever!  I surprised myself when I read all of Nene Adams books in a week.  Fantastic characters and she makes the history tolerable, if not interesting!  We need Ms. Adams to write more of this character.  Her brilliance and her flaws are very well crafted.  You cheer when both women are happy and cry when they feel sad.  I enjoyed the series.",Positive
worst woods book i've read. and i have read them all . i don't believe THE stuart woods wrote it. the politics part ruined it as well as the style . i'll have to get over this before buying another,Negative

I enjoy reading books; especially those that show the history of our land and cultures before the present day folks took the land.,Positive

"As someone who experienced needing to forgive, this book was a great reminder that forgiveness helps the forgiver walk away from bitterness and that forgiveness is a process.  A great read for anyone who has been done wrong by others or who simply wants to live in love and not regret.",Positive
"First off, I am not a particularly advanced cooker, nor am I a picky eater by any stretch. But this is the first time I've paged through a cookbook and thought that almost everything sounded bland, too simple, etc... They take this &#34;5 ingredient&#34; thing seriously too, if you want to have a recipe that is literally how to cook potatoes in a crock pot (ingredients: potatoes. Instructions: poke holes in the potatoes and let it sit for hours in a crock pot) or one that tells you to stick a pack of hot dogs in a slow cooker, then this is the cookbook for you! I gave the other fix it and forget it cookbook, the one not limited to 5 ingredients, a try too and it was filled with much of the same junk.",Negative
"Just finished this last night and thought it was a great book, gives a very real insight to what its really like as a mom, the ups, downs and gross out factor. Only complaint would be that it seemed kind of choppy at times but that isn't because of her writing style, more so due to the blog excerpts inserted in with the rest of the story, which is the point of the book so totally fine, I just wasn't used to reading books in this style so it took a bit to get in the swing of it and read steadily at first, but would def recommend to other moms",Positive

I will like it when I begin to read it.,Positive
"This book will touch the heart of the reader. Gramps is a very soft spoken, believer of the word, has patience and loves kids. He helped the young men in the story to become good citizen and helped them to leave their past and move on with their life. It is a very inspiring story and one that I intend to read again.",Positive
compelling read,Positive
The book arrived in a just a few days which was great because i really needed to study. the condition was fair it was a little more worn than expected but after taping the spine and unbending some pages it suits my needs just fine. Was worth the price compared to a new book for sure especially since I will only need it for school and the program is only a few months long. Overall great buy.,Positive
"great book to teach season and also to go with apple themes.  It is an interactive book where you tap, clap, etc. Fun, Fun!",Positive
Shows all the different Pokemon and evolutions!  Everything is in vivid colors and nice and big!,Positive
"Beverly Cleary’s books were some of the first ones I read independently. The Art of Ramona Quimby brought back so many memories of these books. When the editions illustrated by Tracy Dockray came out, I did wonder if the updated, modern illustrations would work with the original book texts, many of which were written in the ‘50s and ‘60’s. I was unaware until I read this book that yet another edition of Cleary’s books had been released in 2013.. It seems to work; children are still grabbing these books in 2020!<br />The Art of Ramona Quimby focuses on the one character of Cleary’s that had books published about her from the 1950’s all the way in to the ‘90’s. The author did a marvelous  job of taking readers through the decades with  this beloved little girl.  The letters of correspondence between Cleary and the first illustrator, Louis Darling, were a special added bonus. I would recommend this to anyone who has ever enjoyed  Ramona’s adventures through the years.<br />I hope Anna Katz will someday write another book about  the art of some of Cleary’s other characters!<br />Thank you, Netgalley, for providing me with a free copy of this outstanding book. I have a feeling that I’ll be buying a hard copy very soon!",Positive
"This book will definitely  be going on my “Best Of 2020 “ list! It was beautifully written historical fiction, set in the 1950’s in the Deep South. There was a nostalgic feel, due to the author’s attention to details like television sets in store windows, women dressed up in gloves and hats to visit town, icy-cold Cokes bought at the general store on a summer day.  There was an underlying tension beneath the innocence, however; in several places I found myself holding my breath as I read.<br />I loved this story with its message of the power of true friendship. It also shows how destructive predjudice and hatred can be, when people use the excuse, “That’s the way things have always been” to justify it.<br />A wonderful book for Y.A. readers, with adult guidance. Due to the setting, some words are used and attitudes expressed which would be offensive in today’s society. If history teachers use this book in their classrooms, as I would recommend, it could be a great teaching tool about how things have changed for the better since the Civil Rights Movement.<br />**Thank you, Netgalley, for honoring my request for this book in exchange for an honest review! All opinions are strictly my own.**",Positive
"To say &#34;I love to read!&#34; Is an understatement for me; often I'd rather read than eat! Every once in a while, I am fortunate enough to come across a move that is so wonderful, so beautifully written, that to analyze it would ruin the story's impact. All We Have Left is one of those rare books. Read this novel, please, fellow Americans. If you are a teenager who doesn't remember September in 2001, or an adult who does, please take this book to heart. The author sums up why she wrote this in the end notes. On that day, &#34;even in the face of incomprehensible evil, the human spirit prevailed. This is what I hope the children of today and tomorrow will understand about the day the world changed.&#34;- Wendy Mills",Positive
"I had never heard of this book or author until recently, and I was immediately impressed. The scenarios of the shy foster child who adores book characters, the finding of the stray dog and the sweet friendship that develops between Ben and Halley were beautifully written. I like reading books about New York, so the setting really appeals to me. I LOVE the relationship Ben has with Mrs. Lorentz. She was very like a librarian from my childhood, Mrs. Mary Lewis, that I was close to.The &#34;Read to Rufus&#34; concept was great ;as  a teacher I would love to incorporate that into my classroom!<br />Memorable scene in the library (pg. 30): An old man comes in to return a laptop. On his backpack is a sticker READING MAKES YOU LIVE LONGER.JUST LOOK AT ME. Made me laugh out loud, and I love writing that makes me do that!<br />My overall reaction: This was a very well-written, enjoyable read. It does cover some sad situations and topics that would probably be better suited for older children to read about,  with guidance from adults.",Positive
"This book caught my attention because of the historical 1960's setting. It did not disappoint; I loved the details about happenings at the pool, about the music, the drive-in theaters, etc. There are also deeper elements, such as the controversy about sending soldiers to Vietnam. I really came to understand why Tree's father felt as he did about this. It made me think about how important it was, and is now,<br /> to support the military soldiers, even if you don't agree with the government that sends them to fight.<br />The issues of domestic abuse that Tree finds herself in the middle of really gave me sympathy for her situation; I've been in similar dilemmas. Do you risk losing a friendship to speak up and say, &#34;Hey, this can't go on?&#34;<br />I was very moved by the situation of Jack in Vietnam. I did think the book dropped off just a bit too quickly after that, but a fairy tale ending would have ruined it.<br />Overall reaction: Hard to explain, but reading this book gave me &#34;warm fuzzies&#34;, for lack of a more technical term. I wanted to be Tree's friend, and meet all the people she cared about so much, I will definitely read it again; I almost started it over right after finishing it (I don't do that with many books!)<br />I think a sequel would be a great idea! I'll be looking for more books by this author.",Positive
"The Amazon description and the back cover made this book sound much more exciting than it actually turned out to be. Any historical fiction book about WW2 usually holds my interest, but I had to make myself finish this one. The writer simply doesn't do a good job of making the story flow well. Harlow uses words and dialects peculiar to the region, but offers no glossary or explanation as to what they mean. Her writing style seems very flat, for lack of a better word.<br />My overall reaction was that I was glad I only paid $2.99 for this in a used bookstore, because it was quite a boring read.",Negative
"Occasionally I finish a book that leaves me not wanting begin another, at least for a little while, because it really stays with me .I did not want to ruin the stirring feelings I had upon completing Nine, Ten. (This is out of the ordinary for me, as I normally start on another book the minute I finish one.)  It took me back to Before...My boys were four and two...and I remembered how different America was when they were small; on September 10th...before.<br />  Nine, Ten reminded me of what it's like to read historical fiction, good historical fiction, about the Titanic. When an author does as wonderful a job writing about a major event as Baskin does, you do not want to stop reading, even though you know what's coming. Even the author notes and  the acknowledgements  were heart- rending.<br />  I have already recommended Nine, Ten to several people. I think this book would be a wonderful way to teach others about 9-11.It will probably be a nostalgia trip for parents of today, most of whom will remember Before...and how it was so different.",Positive
"I went back and read TKAM before reading this.  I wish I'd stopped at the end of &#34;Mockingbird.&#34;  This new offering -- well, to be blunt, it just isn't that good of a read.  I could sympathize with Scout's (Jean Louise) conflicted feelings as she revisited her home, and discovered new sides to the people she loved.  These were the most interesting parts of the book.  But the conversations with Uncle Jack got really tedious -- if I met the man in person, he would be annoying at least, and might even seem to be mentally unhinged.  His endless literary and historical references added little to the story at hand.  Calpurnia?  We see her for about two pages -- disappointing.  And Atticus?  I just don't know how to feel about him -- and a better book would have more clearly explained his feelings and motivations.  I kept hoping this book would wrap things up nicely.  Not necessary redeem Atticus.  It wasn't mandatory to make him back into the hero we've all loved for fifty years.  But do &#34;something&#34; with him -- I was at least hoping to understand what made him &#34;tick&#34; by the end of this book.  He didn't have to turn out to be an angel, but it would have been nice to at least understand him, and to have his daughter understand him.  I didn't get that.  He seems to be a blank slate -- almost as annoying as Uncle Jack's endless ramblings.  If you're a &#34;Mockingbird&#34; fan, you might want to avoid this one.  I wish I had.",Negative
"At first glance, I thought a book about a &#34;magic pencil&#34; would be very silly and childish. I could not have been more mistaken! I began to love the character of Ava as soon as the plot reveals that she is a worry-wart that thinks &#34;what-if&#34; questions to herself constantly. I could relate so well; I did that myself in school and it's still a habit I struggle with as an adult.  I found it endearing that Ava worries about her family far more than herself. She is a book character that I would long to be friends with in real life, if only so we could reassure each other that things will turn out for the best!  The way in which the author had Ava conquer her fears was really superb; I wanted to keep cheering her on as she progressed through the obstacles ( I probably would have given out a lot quicker than Ava did!) All told, this is a wonderful book to read and it's going in my Amazon cart. I would highly recommend it, especially to all the &#34;worry-warts&#34; and &#34;what-ifers&#34; out there!",Positive
"Frankly, I was disappointed with this book. I actually had to force myself to finish it, which is a very unusual situation for me. I have read every single other book about Kit several times, and enjoyed them all, mainly due to the fact that they were set in the Great Depression.  Well- written historical fiction is my favorite type of book to read. This book makes only one reference to the Depression, literally only one sentence. If I was not familiar with Kit's character already, I would not have known what the setting was, due to the lack of historical references. There is very little continuity between the events and characters in the former books and this one. Lastly, the concluding &#34;Peek Into the Past&#34; section, always present in the other Kit mystery books, has been reduced to two pages and no historical photographs. If this is what the content and format of the &#34;Beforever&#34; books is going to be like, I doubt seriously if I will buy any more.",Negative
"""A Merciful Fate"" is a great read, entertaining and full of many plot twists.  I've enjoyed reading the Mercy Kilpatrick series, hoping for more to come.",Positive

Interesting book.,Positive
Nice book for the persons that like to tried other countries food.,Positive
"I read this in two days! While on a beach vacation, I read this and I was so engaged. The main character, Ove, is a loveable grouch. The range of issues and diversity in this book was handled beautifully and had me tears eyed in many areas. A true gem of a book to not be missed!",Positive
"Trust me, read this book if you are looking to drastically improve your gym performance. I've been working out for a long time 10+ years and decided I should take some advice from the pros. Lots of great info during the first half of the book to help improve your workout and nutrition knowledge. This book is based of what actually works based on tons of studies and results. Each fact is cited based off the studies it was pulled from. I've dropped 8% body fat and 18 lbs in 4 months and looking more cut then ever. My friends have even noticed the drastic changes. Do yourself a favor get this book.",Positive
I purchased this book for my husband for his birthday.  He loves it.  He knew a little bit about sea glass as he is an avid bottle collector.  He was very impressed with the information in this book.  It also helps that it is local to us.  A great addition for his collection.,Positive
"Ann Cleeland Doyle and Acton series is good reading.  Both are enjoyable characters.  Sometimes the story lines are a little farfetched, but still make for a good read!",Positive
Enjoyed reading this mystery.  The main characters were interesting and reasonably well rounded.  The crime was awful and one of a series of a murders.  Reasonable well plotted.  Would read more about these characters.,Positive
"Russo has created a whole town of great characters.  This is a full bodied story with lots of action, subtle and dramatic, with good character development and some unexpected plot twists.  Richard Russo has a great way with the written word and he is humorous ~ you really get to like his people.  I enjoyed reading this book immensely.",Positive
"Well written and charming novel!  Anthony Doerr has created two wonderful primary characters and fleshed out their individual worlds extremely well.  Each is uniquely appealing, resilient and has major life issues to deal with.  Their ultimate meeting is set on the life-altering stage of a continent in the midst of WII.  How events that shaped their lives affect them years later and the changes they undergo as they mature, make for a truly wonderful read.  I have not given this novel justice in this review, I can only encourage you to read it for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.",Positive
"I really enjoy all of William Kent Krueger's books.  Realistic characters, a solid dose of family life and dynamics, some love interest usually, along with mysteries wrapped up with mystique and wilderness locale.  Good escapism.",Positive
"Louise Erdrich writes about a brutal event and how drastically it affects the lives of everyone in the immediate family, about guilt, loss, anger, distance and revenge that hurts when you get it.  This story is told from the perspective of the young teenage son and she has done an exceptional job speaking in that voice.  I found it a compelling story, enjoyed the glimpse into the lives of the community.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading a well-told story about something that happens far too often in our society, rape.",Positive
"I read this book some time ago, but remember it as a well written, tight and interesting book that deals with a very sensitive subject in an eye-opening way.  To ramp up the drama, the book is set in rural america. It's a very good read, but if you like your books light and fluffy, this book isn't for you.  Also, if you hold very conservative political views, be warmed this may challenge your beliefs!",Positive
Perfect and as described!! Wording was on front as hoped. Another description stated it would be on the back and we wanted it on front. Would buy again and makes a great gift!!,Positive
This book is so cute and simple and the rhyming makes it even better. It was a board book as described and in perfect condition when it arrived,Positive

Well written and funny.  Enjoyable reading.,Positive
"This is a nice starter set for anyone just learning about coin collecting.  It's a bit more challenging than collecting the state quarters so if this is for a small child they will need some help reading the material and how to manage the coins.  Many students in 3rd grade will study ""money"" as part of the curriculum and this would make a great package for an adult or older child to share with a 3rd grader, but it's probably too much for most 3rd graders on their own. Enjoy!",Positive
"This book was intensely HOT. The author has a wonderfully large vocabulary. I had to look up words fairly often; some of which weren't even in Wikipedia :) However, given these positive opinions, the author's grammar leaves much to be desired, particularly her inept use of pronouns. I know editing for grammar is grunt work but it is part of the craft. For me it made the difference between four and five stars.",Positive
"At only 167 pages, this is a quick easy read, which I liked because I don't have a lot of time to read.  The author packs a lot into those pages.  He covers 5 common sayings that Christians sometimes say or believe, but aren't really quite what the Bible says or what Jesus taught.  I won't list them here, as they are in the product description.  One of the things that struck me is that God does not control us like puppets and everything is not predestined.  We have free will, but neither does he set us totally free to stumble along through life without any help  The author believes that the truth is somewhere in between where God is more like a parent, guiding when we want help or need it.  Not every thing in life is micromanaged by God.  God probably doesn't care if you pick corn, peas or carrots as your vegetable for a meal.  Another important point - God does not promise life to be free of trouble, pain or temptation, but instead promises to be there for us to help us get through it.  There are so many other good points in this book that I can't even list them all in a short review.  I think this book is a MUST READ for Christians and interesting reading for those who are not, because they might have heard some of the 5 sayings from Christians and now they can understand why and what the true meaning of the scripture is and where these half truths came from.  I don't read very many &#34;religious&#34; books, but this was well worth the time to read it.  It is never boring and he gives a lot of stories and a little humor from time to time as well.",Positive
"A very compelling read.  Didn't seem quite as good as her first book, Sea Biscuit, but still well worth reading.  Excellent writer.  I hope she does a few more books.  Unfortunately she has a debilitating disease that makes any work very, very difficult for her.  Her two books thus far were a gargantuan effort on her part.",Positive
"The sometimes secret and shadowy world of puppy mills is exposed by this book. You will be shocked at the horrendous way that some breeders treat their dogs.  As sad as the situation was and in some cases still is, the book shows that with a lot of money, patience and care, some puppy mill dogs can be restored to reasonable health and happiness.  Some can never be restored after years of abuse and neglect.  The physical abuse is bad enough, but puppy mill dogs suffer immense emotional abuse as well.  Only through the efforts of caring people can these places be shut down.  Many have been stopped with stronger legislation and the efforts of caring people, but I think the book makes it clear that we have to be ever watchful and not do things that allow the puppy mills to flourish.  Adopt an animal from a local humane society and don't insist on a purebred.  Mixed breed dogs are often just as wonderful than full breeds.  They tend to be healthier and often have better dispositions.  The book is an easy read at just 200 pages in my advance copy.  It's a good book for high school kids who might want to get active in protecting animals.  Younger children might be able to read the book easily, but could be disturbed by the terrible treatment that is described in the book.  A must read for any adult who cares about dogs and animals.  At the end of the book is also information on how you can get involved and make a difference.  Very well written and hard to put down.  You may well read it in a single sitting.",Positive
"Haven't quite finished reading this yet, but it sure is an eye-opener on how pampered our pets have become and how much we are willing to spend on them or how much we will sacrifice to fight for their ""rights"".  It is very amusing and yet sobering too when you realize that in some cases we have given our dogs equal status with human beings (or even higher status in some cases).  This might be everything you ever wanted to know about dog politics and dog pampering or it might just be all too much for you to stomach. (Dog birthday parties with cake, decorations, dressed up dogs, photographers and invited guests, for example.)  If you ever wondered if you are giving too much power or importance to your dog, this is the book for you. This is a fun book and well worth owning. Seems like this would be a great book to give as a gift to fanatic dog owners.",Positive
"I never have had any interest in horses or horseracing.  Still don't.  In spite of that I found this book so enjoyable that I couldn't put it down and read it very rapidly.  I saw the movie first, so maybe that helped?  Even if you didn't like the movie (I did), I do recommend you give the book a try.  It is (of course) much more detailed.  Some reviewers found it too detailed, but I thought the initimate details of the lives of the parties involved made this much more enjoyable than if it had been just a book about horseracing.  Some say the first section of the book is slow.  Perhaps so, but I found it interesting and enjoyable and a nice foundation to finally introducing the horse. Includes a fascinating look at the hard life of jockey's in the 30's & 40's.  Worth reading just for that.  Inspiring, emotional, heartwarming story that will have you in tears at times.  Hildebrand knows how to grab the reader and never let go.  Yes, it may be a little syrupy, preachy and overdone at times, but always enjoyable and never boring.  Not many writers could appeal to such a wide audience in a book that is supposedly about horseracing.  It is so much more than a ""horse"" book.  It is really about a team of unlikely people and animals who on their own were failures and worth very little, but as a team came together to produce one of the most enduring legends in American history.",Positive
"My book arrived yesterday and last night I began to read it. I am not even halfway through but felt compelled to share this much as a review: This book is so well written, and every sentence is poignant and concise, relaying needed information without too many personal reflections of the author muddying the content. I already feel much more educated on the subject matter, and would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious or open to the study and/or practice of this religion.",Positive
"To be honest, I listened to the audiobook based purely on Jack Edward's video review after he read it. I really wasn't certain what to expect and was pleasantly blown away.<br /><br />First, let me say that Ms. July has a wonderful handle on the art of prose writing and paints hauntingly real depictions of the way people perceive themselves and the world.<br /><br />Secondly, these stories are mostly told from the perspective of alienated souls and social black sheep. They are intense, human stories about love and sexuality and loss and being used and yet there are glimmers of hope and salvation mixed in to sustain you.<br /><br />This a book you will definitely return to reread several times over in a lifetime.",Positive
"Compelling, full of heart, a history of pain born of systematic genocide over centuries and the woe born in the loss in both survivor and empathetic ear. I bought this book for my mother, an Ojibwe of White Earth, Minnesota, after I was midway through my own copy. May the echoes of wisdom enclosed within these pages move her spirit as it has my own.  Though I am of mixed blood, I can feel my people close when the voice of Dan reaches through Nerburn's words time and again. Thank you.",Positive
"This is an exceptional keepsake, and sure to give anyone hours of enjoyment assembling the replicas.  Bought it for my boyfriend's birthday, he's going to be blown away.",Positive
"Raymond Smullyan is a master of blending wondrous tales of adventure seamlessly with complex topics such as functional, abstract, and symbolic logic, as well as deductive games and exercises. This book is actually one of the best explorations of combinatory logic I have ever encountered. Disguised cleverly by the analogy of birds singing, you will be working through complex mathematical proofs in no time, without even realizing that you're doing it! You'll think it's all just bluebirds and warblers calling to each other!<br /><br />Combinatory logic is one of the most obscure and fascinating branches of logic I have ever encountered. Its mathematical counterpart (largely the same thing) is known as lambda calculus, and it in fact is used extensively in artificial intelligence and programming language design. The Lisp programming language is actually based on lambda calculus. Learning either combinatory logic or lambda calculus is a venture for only those whose mind is best suited to mathematics, logic, or computer science. If you are someone interested in all three (like myself) then this is the book for you!<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for nerdy types, or anyone who likes puzzles.",Positive

Very helpful.  Good pictures,Positive
I am reading this now.  It is very funny and insightful into the life of a Jewish boy growing up in very unusual circumstances.  His youthful interests were also unusual to say the least.  His complete lack of interest  and  loathing for school did not interfere with his obsession and love of  a wide range of activities.  Thank goodness he followed his heart and found his genius.,Positive
A wide variety of classical music and composers.  Mostly intermediate level.,Positive
"Seemingly excellent research on trees.  That part was interesting and makes one enjoy and appreciate the whole “tree function, history and importance” to our existence.  The characters, for me, were bizarre, mentally overboard and traveling fast toward disaster!  In other words, out of control!  Not a book for me to keep in my library even though some “literary experts” sung its praises.",Negative
My 10 yr old grdaughter is reading this book. She said its easy to read and the grparents say things just like I do lol. Fun story for her age and above.,Positive

She ends up moving into the Manor..the same one that has to be finished with the restoration and has its own ghosts....and this is where Laylas story begins. This story is so well written that as you read it you can actually ""feel"" what the characters are going through. There is plenty of paranormal activity that will have you believing and wondering if it's really possible. I highly recommend this q/series to everyone. Can also be read as a stand alone, but why would you want to miss the beginning of the story with so many secrets and shocking surprises?",Positive

Lots of action and when things get personal, both characters prove that they will do ANYTHING for each other and family,even if it involves The Mob !

The story captures you right from the beginning as you can feel the excitement between the two girls heading out on their camping vacation.... But they never get there. They place they end up in is so cold and deserted. As the author describes the setting, you can visualise in your mind, this horrible prison in the woods. The warden..do you trust her when she's nice? This is one of those books that you will not be able to put down !  I myself stayed up until 430 am because I was at a crucial part lol.

I can only say if you love suspense, you will love this book.  Incredible story !",Positive
This is the first book that I have read from the author. I can say I was truly hooked from the first chapter. This is one of those sit on the edge of your seat stories with so many twists ! I had to read it all in one sitting because I couldn't put it down !  I had a love hate relationship with the lead male character and admire the will to live and do what was needed to stay alive from the lead female.

While trying to help someone to be released from an old family curse...Lily is busy also trying to find out who and why a fellow shop owner is murdered.As she is busy investigating all this, her familiar Oscar disappears ..and now it is Lily who needs the help..are they all related?

While I thought there were too many characters for me to follow in this book..I  really loved the storyline. There is mystery and developing friendships to carry on into the  next books.

Looking forward to starting the next  book. definitely recommend this fun series.,Positive

It is amazing how Sally seems so meek and timid in the beginning,but after she has a son she does a complete turn around to protect her son, Zander and keep them both alive. Wonderful characters,with a very real storyline. I received a free copy and this  honest review was my choice. I also purchased this in print because I LOVE THIS series. I recommend reading this series in order to get the &#34;WOW&#34; factor.",Positive
"this is the first book I am reading from this author. I love this book. The main character Lilly is a witch just trying to fit in somewhere. She finally settles in a lovely area and runs a vintage used clothing store. As the story progresses she meets this mysterious man named Aiden..who just happens to be a male witch, and a very strong and powerful one. The story line is well written. All the characters fit together well. And who wouldn't love having a pig, named Oscar as their  familiar? this story also shows how Lilly is unsure about using her power and how she comes to the realization that she just might be very powerful. I cant wait to see what happens between her and Aiden.",Positive
"this is one of those ghost stories that you will fall in love with. If you have seen and loved  the movie &#34;the ghost and Mrs. Muir&#34; then this book is for you. There is an old mansion that is in desperate need of repair, and someone to live there and love it. The characters are so well written. I love how they all mesh together no matter what century they come from...and yes, some are ghosts. That is what makes this book such a good read. You will fall in love with all of the characters as did I..well except maybe &#34;one&#34;. the old lord of the manor because he doesn't want anyone living in his house and will stop at nothing to make sure it doesn't happen!",Positive
"I love this series. It's like all the crazy characters are life long friends. In this book,there is a zombie following Deanna around town. It's up to the whole group to find out who is controlling it. The difference in this story,to me, is the very abrupt ending. This is just my opinion.. can't wait to get on to the next book!",Positive
"another great story in the life of Deanna Oscar. After years of caring for her dying younger brother , Deanna comes back home to her mansion and crazy friends. In this book, she even meets death himself ! To me he sounds like an interesting character, but Deanna wants to know why is he following her? After her brother has died, he hasn't &#34;moved on&#34; and gran is beginning to worry and wonder why he hasn't been around. Although Deanna knows there is a waiting period, she thought he would have showed up at her house by now...could death stalking her have anything to do with it? I really liked the bar that she must go into after she agrees to Ivy setting her up on a ghost hunting show. A great and mysterious ghost story once again..!",Positive
"I really love this series. Deanna is learning so much about her gift as a psychic medium and trying to find murderers and stop more deaths from happening. In this book,her family comes to visit,but she is having a hard time with them around. She begins to doubt her abilities. I like where this book is going with its characters,but I find Deanna to be a little rude and conceted In this one,which I didn't care for...but that being said,I loved how things turned out towards the end. The real killer was a surprise. Heading off to read the next book in this series now.",Positive
"what a fun and amazing story.  I love this author. her characters are strong.this is the beginning of a new life for Dr.De who inherits her grmas house and money..she also has inherited her psycic abilities and begins to forsee the deaths of little girls. she can also see ghosts,as well . she begins to help the police find this crazed killer.

"this is such a great book. who wouldn't love a book about ghosts returning from the dead to  lol help kill &#34;wearbeasts&#34;? this author really knows how to describe a scene! I actually have read other series by this author, &#34;the Bell and Whitehouse&#34; series was the first. I love reading these kind of fun ghost stories. I know this is the first book in a new series and I can honestly say, I cant wait to read more. I highly recommend checking this author out! the characters are awesome, even the ghosts..lol",Positive
Another great book in the series. In this book something wonderful happens after a lot of bad stuff.Lol a very long awaited meeting takes place....and jinxs family is growing. I really love reading this series and seeing how Jinx is developing her powers and how the new characters come in. Great story,Positive
"Well,this book is even better than the first. Jinx is learning so much more about her powers. I can't say too much with out giving away the surprise,but there is so much more information about the other characters in Jinxs life that comes out ...but she doesn't know yet! However,her and her bff Tori,find out why they are so close..it's not just a coincidence . They way the author lets us know these surprises is written so well..it definitely sets the stage for the next book and I can't wait to read it.!!! I voluntarily leave reviews for all the books I read whether I pay for them or get them free ...",Positive
"I received this book for free and my review is left voluntarily. I like to leave one for any book I read.  This is the first book in the series and the first book that I am reading from this author. I am so glad that I did !!!  It has everything that I love to read in a book......there is a wonderful mystery,a girl who finds out that she is a witch,there are ghosts, fun times,a best friend,a hot guy who lives next door....a store with a mind of her own....Lol and,a rat named Rodney!!!! I am so excited to read the next book in the series and so happy I found this wonderful new author to follow !!!",Positive
"I love reading these books about jolly mart..just like in the big chain stores..things can go wrong,especially murder.I think this short is such a fun read and I wish I was as observant as June is.  she notices so many little things which makes her a great amature sleuth. I cant wait to read more about the adventures of being a sample lady in a store..Chrissy does it again!",Positive
"**I was given an advanced readers copy. All opinions expressed are my own.**.  every so often I like to mix things up a bit and read something different. I usually read cozy mysteries,and an occasional light romance....but this is not either of those! This is one that I was referring to about mixing it up, I fell in love with the characters in the first book called &#34;Red on the run&#34;. This book will keep you in suspense from the very beginning...and at times it will make your heart start pumping...( I actually found myself reading faster as the excitement was escalating,lol)..... thinking that the syndicate is fading away after 17 years,Jason is writing a book about them and the corruption they bring ,until dead bodies are being discovered and he realizes that the syndicate has never really stopped ...they just have been regrouping and are coming back even stronger...and &#34;they&#34; want control of what Jason is writing about them in his book... this is a real page turner. another great suspenseful read from a great author...I highly recommend this book as well as the first...and I cannot wait for the next one.",Positive
"Well after some issues with one of the earlier books in this series,I am so glad that I kept going with these ... I feel that the main character,Jill is getting more out of her life now,even if she has the hots for 3 sexy men and nothing is getting serious with any of them........yet.Winky is hilarious as ever.The cliffhinger at the end makes me gasp and makes me want to get right to reading the next book..stick  it out with this series,you will be happy you did.!!!",Positive
"This is such a fun series to read...in this the 3rd book in the series,Jill  Is getting to see  detective Maxwell in a new way...She is learning more about witchcraft and her &#34;new&#34; family,and the sexy wizard named Drake, She continues to solve cases. I really love how she interacts with the ugly one eyed cat Winky,who is a hoot lol..I like the way the characters are advancing. The surprise at the end makes me want to read the next book right away..",Positive
"This is book 3 in the Jane Madison series. The bulk of the story has some moments where the description of what the author is talking about,has a tendency to drag on with too many details,but for the most part, I liked this book the most out of the 3. I say that because Jane has a very important decision to make in this one...she must choose between staying with the man she has finally fallen in love with,who accepts her for who she is..or to develop her magical powers.  While in the months that she is deciding,she is also too busy to keep practicing witchcraft,so it ends up fading...a lot.,the stones and crystals are turning to dust and the ink on the pages of her special books of spells is disappearing. David,her warder tells her she must use her powers to make them strong and come back to her...so she creates an anime to help her clean and restore her magical tools....but while she is performing her creative spell,she is distracted by the memory of her passionate night with David...and unknowingly creates a monster,...no problem there right? ,Lol until the anime runs away and can not be found.....the adventure in the book really picks up then..and the reason I think this is the best book so far is because of what happens after she finds out that the anime is missing...Jane truely comes into her own after the anime captures Neko,her familiar.!!  Lots of surprises in this one !",Positive
"This is not the usual ghost story. This one is the story of a girl who is a witch but does not really know of all the powers she has. Her best friend is a very happy, bubbly gay man,who is very into doing witchcraft,even though he is not a witch..  Mara is struggling to make a living and pay her rent and after she gets evicted from her apartment, she tries a magic spell,knowing that even if it does work,she might have terrible consequences to deal with later.  Well the spell works and she soon receives a letter telling her that  her aunt Tillie is dead and that she has left Mara her cottage in wisconsin,she has this reoccurring dream about a woman crashing her car,dying,and a road in the woods. After she travels by car to the new town she stops at the local gas station/ mini Mart for supplies and the young clerk warns her that her new cottage is haunted. She laughs it off and continues to the cottage. Suddenly she has a de ja vue moment and recognizes the area, and its the same one in her dreams !! To make matters worse,she thinks it was her aunt in the dreams and she caused the accident that killed her.  Mara  ends up living there and discovers the portal to hell and she releases 2  demons from the past. Then her aunt Tillies ghost  teams up with her and soon ,her gay friend Gus comes to help them.  Inspite of all this it is a very funny story that you will love",Positive
"who knew that inheriting a funeral home from your father can be so interesting... and fun even if your mother is a religious,bible thumping yelling fanatic?.. and you have to live with her !!! well thats how Laural Bays life is now..thinking she will just sell the business and move away ..back to her old life.Until she meets the hunky Basil ..the family accountant...and starts to see ghosts....lol. very fun read..few ghosts,and a lot of characters that you cant wait to become friends with..????",Positive
"I love reading about Agnes and Eleanor..they are senior citizens who are always on the move and that means,they are usually at the right place...at the wrong time ! lol. and there's usually a body or two involved. this set of 3 books is the beginning of the series and not only are there bodies ..there are ghosts..some are friendly,some are sweet, some are snarky, and some are just down right scary !  ..and Agnes and El..meet them all. There is even a young girl ghost who attaches herself to Agnes...after Ag gets into a bad car accident and hits her hear,.she wakes up in the hospital with this ghost looking at her..seems Aggie's accident happened at the exact place that the ghost &#34;CAROLINE&#34; died in her hit and run accident..this is where the ghosts become visible to Agnes and she is surprised to have this new talent.. but it does help her as she begins to investigate the history of the ghosts..who they are,how they died,and darn it..why are they coming to Agnes for help and darn it..why didn't they cross over !!. it makes for a fun lighthearted who done what to whom ..and a very good read.. def recommend them..",Positive
"I loved the whole series of Mudbug..Helena the ghost keeps this one funny with all the things happening to her as she &quot;learns&quot; how to be a ghost.Each book tells you about the life and antics of one main character but it also combines the other ones with the new..the lives all intertwine and thtas what makes this a fun,suspenseful and at time sexy read...It gets your heart pumping even just after you have laughted your a - - off lol..Going to read more from this author !!!",Positive
"Purchased for my mom for her birthday and she reads a verse to me almost everyday. Good product, excellent purchase.",Positive
"Long awaited second novel in the series and it was worth the wait. A lot of action and the romance between Bailey, the dragon slayer and Aiden, the shape shifting dragon was slow but sweet.<br />I would love more romance in book three and More of a storyline with Phoebe. I don't like love triangles but maybe something to shake Aiden up and get him to man up and commit.<br />Loved the book and I highly recommend the series.",Positive
"Fast paced. Action, suspense and enough romance to keep things interesting. The summary is pretty accurate but beware of cliffhangers. Recommended and I will continue the series.",Positive
Much better than book one. I wasn't sure if i would like this series but it is surprisingly good. This installment covers Kylen's redemption and falling in love but we still have the other main characters playing a main role. Written very well.<br />I recommend and plan to continue with book three.,Positive
"No spoilers for this review. The summary is pretty spot on with the content of the book.<br />Aurora the female lead was written perfectly snarky, competent and as untrustworthy as a normal teen girl. I did think that her not trusting the boys with the truth of her existence the entire book was a bit annoying. I know this was so there could be a book two but in the moment it was frustrating. I liked her clean relationship with all the boys and her connection with Ayden. That was cute, not over done. Aurora spent a lot of time being saved and after a while, I started wondering where her parents were and why was she always caught unaware.<br />Overall, well-written, clean, likeable characters and the story flowed well.<br />Book two will definitely be worth it if on KU.",Positive
The premise was very good and that is the only reason I made it to 26% before quitting in frustration. The writing was very stunted. Think high school creative writing class. I wanted to finish but it was that bad. If the author were to get an editor or a ghost writer... I would try again. A little disappointing but thank goodness for kindle unlimited.,Negative
"The original Kosher Palette came out in 2001 and quickly became a beloved classic in thousands of homes. Many cooks treasured their dog-eared and battered copies, and after the book went out of print, it was fetching high prices. But in 2022, ArtScroll published the revised anniversary edition, which includes the over 300 double- and triple-tested recipes that made the original such a classic, as well as updated nutritional advice, healthier swaps, and updated tips and sidebars.<br /><br />The book's photos, layout, and recipes remain unchanged, while the new edition is larger, hardcover instead of spiral-bound, and features heavy glossy paper.<br /><br />I love the traditional chapter, which features stellar recipes for golden chicken soup with fluffy matzoh balls, kasha varnishkes, heavenly bread machine challah, and Pesach and holiday recipes that have stood the test of time.<br /><br />This revised anniversary edition will become a staple in your home kitchen as it also includes tips on table settings, flower arrangements, and how to create an elegant atmosphere that will elevate your meal from ordinary to extraordinary!",Positive
"I'm a contributing food writer for the Japan Times; having lived in Japan the last five years, I've started making my own osechi ryori from scratch, including datemaki, nishime, kohaku namasu, tazukuri, kazunoko and kuromame using Nami's recipes. In addition to no-fail recipes for these staples and many more, she also offers awesome tips and diagrams for how to arrange your jubako (tiered lacquered box) and an advance cooking guide since many of these items must be started several days in advance. Her dishes taste 110% like the ones I've enjoyed in Japan, including in friends' homes. Highly recommended!",Positive
"Rising Hope was one of the very first cookbooks I purchased after returning from Japan, I saw it mentioned on several Facebook groups and the recipes sounded intriguing. What I wasn’t expecting was a beautifully illustrated book full of fantastic recipes, but even better are the stories of women whose lives have been changed by working at the bakery. They are trained to become bakers and find independence after escaping domestic violence and disadvantaged pasts.<br /><br />I have tried several of the bread recipes along with the kumquat rosemary marmalade, which is my new fave!<br /><br />Another great thing is that there are recipes that are gluten-free and vegan as well. i’ve enjoyed everything I have tried making so far and can’t wait to try additional recipes from this beautiful book!",Positive
"I have a large collection of baking books, including international ones, and bought this on a whim after looking for a cookbook that included step-by-step descriptions of kubaneh, a rich, flaky yeast dough traditionally served on the Sabbath after cooking overnight.<br /><br />Liorsh's beautiful cookbook includes detailed instructions for classic Israeli bakes like kubaneh and bourekas, multiple variations on challah, babka, seasonal treats like hamentaschen, cheesecakes and quiches, and favorites like  canneles. I love that she has so many sweet and savory options used in creative ways, like a roasted vegetable babka, Brie cheesecake, and cinnabon kubaneh. The step-by-step photos are tremendously helpful as well, and as a baker who uses metric, I appreciated that metric measurements and temperatures were included as well as imperial.<br /><br />The hardcover book is beautifully produced and came shrink-wrapped, which I always appreciate!",Positive
"I had the opportunity to test out Faigy Murray's ""My Pesach Kitchen"" for Kosher.com and loved it! Faigy has taken the guesswork and stress out of menu planning, shopping, and preparing your kitchen for Pesach. The 130 recipes are a nice blend of classics (chicken soup with matzo balls, Shabbos chicken, lamb roast, London Broil several ways) with trendy modern twists and international flair. You'll find minimal processed or exotic ingredients and recipes are simple enough that even the kids can help out. Beautiful food photography will inspire you to cook your way through from cover to cover. A must-have for your Pesach kitchen or any time of year!",Positive
"I've had the pleasure of cooking my way through the Instant Pot Kosher cookbook over the last couple of months, and I can honestly say this has become my favorite cookbook for quick, flavorful dinners.<br /><br />Beginning with an introduction to electric pressure cookers, you'll find seven chapters from breakfast to desserts packed with classic comfort food like kugel, brisket, chicken soup with matzoh balls, even cholent, along with a great variety of international cuisines (Italian, Indian, Japanese, Mexican, American regional including grits and Texas chili).<br /><br />As I'm more of a grazer, I loved the chapter on appetizers and dips, including beet and mint salad, hummus, za'atar-spiced deviled eggs, and dolmas with beef and mint (Beyond Beef is a great stand-in for vegetarians).<br /><br />Meat Mains features Hungarian chicken paprikash, shicken shwarma, Veal osso buco, turkey, roast beef, stuffed cabbage, Persian lamb and bean stew, a beef tagine and spicy ribs with coffee and chili sauce.<br /><br />The vegetarian mains also includes seafood (which is pareve in the kosher kitchen) and has options like tofu tikka masala, dal and rice, wild mushroom risotto, vegan zucchini rolls with cashew cheese, poached salmon with mustard dill sauce, Asian salmon and Thai red curry fish.<br /><br />Sides include jeweled Israeli couscous, lentils and rice with spiced onions, tzimmis, ratatouille, apple raisin noodle kugel, and asparagus with lemon and herb sauce.<br /><br />Desserts include simple fruit preparations like applesauce and berry compote along with flan, rice pudding, honey cake, mocha lava cakes and flourless chocolate cake, and New York Cheesecake with orange caramel sauce (I've made numerous cheesecakes in my Instant Pot and am never going back to baking in a water bath!).<br /><br />Of the several recipes I tested, the cooking times and instructions were spot on.<br /><br />There's enough variety here to keep you cooking happily for many weeks or months to come, and the generous list of suggested menus for holidays (particularly Passover) will take the guesswork out of creating a showstopping menu that will have your guests thinking you spent all day in the kitchen!",Positive
"My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan, where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing, jewel-like salads.<br /><br />Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar, and in “365”, you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads, soups, pasta, sandwiches, vegetables, seafood, meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce, marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.<br /><br />With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries, the recipes featuring bright, sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange, Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala, Spaghetti with Ricotta, Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone, and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil, Marjoram, and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.<br /><br />Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere, German beef, beet and potato stew, and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple, provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.<br /><br />The salads are a particular delight, including the rainbow potato salad with radishes, shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs, beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate, raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino, and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.<br /><br />Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine, like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar, watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala, basil and mint, and squash pasta with orange, maple and sage.<br /><br />If you are someone who, like me, can never seem to come up with a complete menu, that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.<br /><br />I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes; slow roasted and tossed with olive oil, confectioner’s sugar, and herbs, they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!<br /><br />Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.<br /><br />This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years; highly recommended.",Positive
"Long before the Instapot craze, slow cookers were my go-to for long days at work. The perfect choice for items that require long cooking and simmering time with minimal involvement, I frequently use my slow cooker for batches of dried beans, garlic confit, and even drinks.<br /><br />I own around 15 slow cooker cookbooks, so was thrilled when I was given the chance to review The Super Easy Vegetarian Slow Cooker cookbook.<br /><br />A very concise intro chapter with suggested protein and topping ideas leads into staples, which gives you a foundation to build on. In this chapter, you'll find slow-cooked beans, veggie broth, yogurt, dairy-free milk, seasoning mixes, sauces, and even pumpkin spice latte syrup.<br /><br />Each recipe clearly breaks down ""free from"" items, prep time, and total time.<br /><br />I loved the range of international influences, from samosa bites, German hot slaw, Ethiopian chickpea stew, Thai and Indian curries to shakshuka and falafel, Mexican, and Irish-inspired pub fare.  There's a nice bit of variety to keep you happily experimenting for months to come.<br /><br />Desserts include lemon curd, rice pudding, bread puddings, quick breads and cheesecake.<br /><br />You'll also find a handy list of measurement conversions, slow cooker size conversion, and slow cooker care tips.<br /><br />If you're looking for healthy and wallet-friendly recipes with minimal processed ingredients (no ""cream of _____""  or soup packet shortcuts here!), you'll want to check out the Super Easy Vegetarian Slow Cooker Cookbook!",Positive
"Having lived in Japan for four years, Japanese food (specifically homestyle cuisine) is a topic near and dear to my heart, so I was thrilled when my friend Atsuko Ikeda released “Atsuko’s Japanese Kitchen,” which contains the wisdom over more than 10 years of her cooking classes.<br /><br />In a country as ancient as Japan, tradition and ceremony plays a huge role in everyday life, influencing every aspect. Nowhere is this truer than in the kitchen. Many of the principles of Japanese cuisine (five colors, flavors and cooking methods, best known for its role in Zen shojin ryori) date back hundreds of years (if not longer).<br /><br />Beginning with a very helpful overview of the eight major regions of Japan (each one with its own regional specialties), the introduction (particularly the graphic organizers / sample meal planners and cooking timelines) alone is worth the cost of the book.<br /><br />The very helpful illustrated guide to pantry essentials and kitchen tools will help you to track down exactly the right items to make your Japanese meals a success. You’ll also learn to craft dashi (Japan’s “mother sauce”), how to cook the perfect rice, and how to pair sake.<br /><br />The “small dishes for sharing” include staples like nasu dengaku, dashimaki tamago, wasabi edamame, deep-fried skewers, fried tofu, karaage, and gyoza along with fusion items like mushrooms with blue cheese, yuzu ponzu and truffle.<br /><br />Miso soup is a must in Japan (it’s consumed at nearly every meal). I absolutely loved the variations like miso soup with watercrewss and fried tofu and aubergine and sesame miso soup to add a little variety to my regular routine.<br /><br />And noodle-based soups like ramen and udon are ubiquitous in Japan; I greatly appreciated that Atsuko provided some vegetarian alternatives like Piri Kara Soba, Tonyu Kinoko Jiru, and an eggplant mapo tofu (I was surprised to learn that we share the same shojin ryori mentor Mari Fujii-san!).<br /><br />You’ll find regional specialties like Miyazaki’s Chicken Nanban and comforting family meals like shabu shabu, tuna tataki, nabe (hotpot), braised pork belly, and traditional sides like green beans dressed with toasted sesame seeds and pumpkin salad.<br /><br />Although many of the dishes are meat and seafood-based, there are several excellent sides for pickled, marinated and dressed veggies and a number of tofu-based dishes (including a savory shio-koji marinated tofu cutlet).<br /><br />Desserts include Dorayaki, ichigo daifuku, baked tofu cheesecake, an amazing matcha tiramisu, yuzu rare cheesecake, and a vegan almond kuzu tofu,<br /><br />The food photography by Yuki Sugiura is uniformly outstanding, with beautiful Japanese ceramics and tablewares showing off ingredients and dishes to their best advantage (in Japan, we eat with our eyes first…)<br /><br />So if you’ve wanted to learn to cook Japanese food at home but thought it was too daunting, this wonderful cookbook will guide you step by step and give you the confidence to soon be cooking dishes that would be at home on any dinner table in Japan.",Positive
"I’ve been blessed to teach hundreds of students from the Middle East, who generously shared their culture, cuisine and stories over tiny porcelain cups of cardamom-scented Arabic coffee, dates from royal orchards, and rosewater-soaked pastries, and “Baladi” captures the essence of Palestine in a beautifully tangible way that pays tributes to Palestine’s farmers, fishermen, bakers, market sellers, and ordinary daily family life – you will certainly want to add this to your cookbook collection and it is one of my top cookbooks of 2018.<br /><br />I previously reviewed Joudie Kalla’s love song “Palestine on a Plate” in January 2017 when I quickly fell in love with the brilliant recipes and remembrances of her family’s kitchen. In her sophomore “Baladi: Palestine: A Celebration of Food from Land and Sea,” Joudie again pays homage to her homeland of Palestine, this time by taking readers to small villages, farms, orchards, markets and experiencing the changing seasons and various cuisines.<br /><br />The word “Baladi” means “My home, my land, my country.” Despite its small size, Palestine is home to a wide range of terrains, including uninhabited desert and cold areas along the northern border, with access to the sea and rivers as well as an abundance of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs. Because of its prime location on a trade route crossing multiple borders, there are also other international influences on Palestinian cuisine which “makes us all family in the end.”<br /><br />Market life is central to traditional Palestinian culture and dictates the day’s menu, as many still shop daily and buy whatever is freshest. In the market chapter, you’ll find turmeric mlik with cracked cardamom pods, Arabic coffee, the incredibly simple yet indulgent grape molasses and tahini spread (the Palestinian equivalent to the PB&J of our youth!), the fantastic fryup of grilled halloumi, fried eggs, and roasted tomatoes, mixed vegetable salad with tahini dressing, soft-boiled eggs with yogurt, chili and lemon, fried eggplant slices with honey and tahini, watermelon, feta and red onion with mint, and hummus (the entire first chapter is basically a vegetarian’s dream menu).<br /><br />“The Fields and Earth” offers up an abundant harvest of veggies served every way: fried okra with chili, roasted beets,  sautéed, caramelized (the caramelized shallots with herby labneh was a revelation!), served kubbeh-style, fresh salads (goat cheese, dates, and endives pair spectacularly), and lemon potatoes.<br /><br />s a baker at heart, my heart sang at the wide range of stuffed pastries and homemade breads like khubez (pita), Mai’s Akkawi Bread liberally coated in za’atar and stuffed with salty white cheese, za’atar and feta brioche twists, fatayer, and dumplings.<br /><br />“The farm” delights meat eaters with ample recipes for lamb and poultry, while the seas and rivers offer arak-poached salmon, marinated sardines, shatta-marinated sea bass with crushed rose petals, fish skewers, fried fish, and kataifi-wrapped shrimp.<br /><br />“Hills and orchards” uses the abundance of the harvest to create watermelon juice with mint and orange blossom (I got hooked on fresh watermelon juice living in Taiwan, and there is no better cure for summer heat and humidity), fresh pomegranate and mango juice, strawberry, orange blossom, and rose jam, apple and pistachio jam, preserved lemons, pickled olives, baklawa, filo pastries filled with sweetened cream, rose and pistachio eclairs, the endangered tamriyeh, khafeh cheesecake, pistachio, zucchini, and lemon cake, black sesame cake, chocolate and labneh cake with slivered pistachios, qatayef, tahini halva, and gorgeous, dramatic ice cream roulades.<br /><br />Recipe names are given in English and Arabic in both metric and US measurements.<br /><br />The book is illustrated throughout with luscious food photography by Jamie Orlando Smith, stunning photography of Palestine’s diverse landscapes as well as scenes from daily life (working the farm, pulling noodles, carrying in the day’s catch), gorgeous table settings, and Palestinian embroidery. Each recipe offers the reader / cook insight into ingredients, preparation, or personal memories that make these more than simple recipes;  instead you feel as if you are sharing a meal with Joudie’s family.<br /><br />(review copy courtesy of Interlink Books – shukran!)",Positive
"As the grandchildren of immigrants as well as a second-generation American, “The Immigrant Cookbook: Recipes that Make America Great” speaks to me on a very personal level. My grandmother and great-grandparents immigrated from southeast Poland in the early 20th century and my grandmother would frequently recall the steerage class ocean crossing on the SS Lapland as well as take out her copy of the Ellis Island Cookbook. No slouch in the kitchen, she recreated the flavors of her homeland, at times using New World substitutions or would have friends bring staples like kielbasa and farmers cheese from distant Chicago. Luckily their new community had a large, vibrant Polish community (which has sadly diminished with the passing of the older generation) and I was raised to appreciate the Polish language, songs, culture, and most of all, cuisine.<br /><br />America has and will always be a nation of immigrants; this includes the Cajuns of Louisiana, Mexican-American and Tex-Mex communities, the vibrant Polish communities of Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, Dearborn’s Arab enclave, and the many Greektowns and Chinatowns. “The Immigrant Cookbook: Recipes that Make America Great” is the panacea to the current atmosphere of anti-immigrant rhetoric and reminds us of the richness that these many new Americans have contributed to our collective cuisine. In addition to being the grandchild of immigrants, I have also been honored to teach students from over 100 countries, including war-torn ones like Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia, and South Sudan, and I treasure my discussions about food and culture with my students (some of them even cooked for me!).<br /><br />Divided thematically into nine chapters, Leyla Moushabeck has collected 75 recipes that pay tribute to the richness of the immigrant experience. From crispy pork belly, smoky eggplant dips, coconut-infused “dream fish” and the smoky spice of chipotle-lime chicken to desserts rich with syrup and rosewater and the showstopping fruit pavlova crowned with mango, pineapple, sand passion fruit, there are recipes that will appeal to everyone.<br /><br />You’ll find such notable names as Daniel Boulud (Lyonnaise Salad with Lardons), Jose Andres (Tichi’s Gazpacho), Joanne Chang (Mama Chang’s Hot and Sour Soup), Salma Hage (Vegan Lebanese Moussaka), Najmieh Batmanglij (Pomegranate and Walnut Khoresh), Ana Sortun, Martin Yang (Steamed Fish with Ginger Wine Sauce), Aaron Sanchez (Carnitas Tacos), Curtis Stone (Pavlova with Coconut Cream and Tropical Fruit), Einat Admony (Fenugreek Fried Bread), Dominique Ansel (Mini Madelines), and Joan Nathan (German Plum Tart) alongside up-and-coming young chefs showcasing recipes proudly representing their homelands. I loved that there is an alphabetical list of contributors including detailed biographies (and bibliographies). Some of the recipes are already a mixture of immigrant influences, such as Peru’s Japanese-infused cuisine, or Israel’s rich melting pot.<br /><br />Many of the included recipes are homestyle dishes that can be put together fairly quickly; I particularly loved the salads like Kurus with Spoon Salad, Reem’s Muhammara, Smoky Eggplant Dip with Pomegranates and Walnuts and the Gazan Hot Tomato and Dill Salad, which I like to serve as a meal as a spread of several hot and cold vegetable salads accompanied by homemade naan and fresh fruit. Others like Sicilian Frittedda embrace seasonal veggies like artichokes, fresh fava beans (which are currently in season here in Japan) and asparagus with a surprising whisper of mint that brightens the vegetal notes.<br /><br />Measurements are given in both US and metric, which I appreciated.<br /><br />Interlink Books (the same publishing company behind the bestselling fundraiser “Soup for Syria”) has produced another beautiful, welcoming book that is certain to inspire you to expand your own culinary repertoire (in addition to cooking my family’s Polish cuisine, I am also well-versed on Japanese, Turkish, and Middle Eastern / Persian cooking). It’s also commendable that Interlink publishing will donate a minimum of $5 from the sale of each book to the American Civil Liberties Union to support the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. Please join me in supporting this worthwhile cause by purchasing this great book!",Positive
"Food blogger and home cook Maryam Sinaiee takes readers through a full year in the Persian kitchen, including the festivals, traditions and rituals that make up day-to-day life across Iran.<br /><br />Born in Tehran, Maryam learned to cook from her mother, grandmothers, and aunts. The kitchens of her youth were filled with the aromas of frying kotlet, stained glass jars of pickled fruits and vegetables, and sweets.  After relocating to the UK, she started her blog the Persian Fusion.<br /><br />Iran is a large country, with many regional specialties. What we call Persian cuisine has been shaped by the Persian Empire’s ancient expansion, trade on the Silk Road, and the wide range of climates within Iran. Regional cooking in southern Iran has been influenced by Indian, Arab and African cuisines. The recipes in the book are taken from Gilan, Mazandaran, Azarbaijan, Kurdistan, Hormozgan, and Khuzestan.<br /><br />Persian food is based on the theory of “hot” and “cold”: high-energy, high-protein foods are considered “hot” (no relation to spicy), while many vegetables and fruit (particularly sour ones) are “cold.” Persian meals are a careful balance of these elements; it’s believed that too much “hot” food can cause rashes and hot flashes, while too much “cold” food causes digestive issues and low energy. A meal may balance out each of these elements in the same dish; for example, walnuts are “hot” so they are served with pomegranate (“cold.”).<br /><br />Like my country of Japan, Persian cuisine places great importance on seasonality and the first vegetables of the season, which are called “first of the harvest.” The Persian calendar is based around nature, beginning in March with Noruz (the spring equinox). Iran’s seasonal festivals (including harvest and rain) predate Islam by some 1,400 years. Persian cuisine places high priority on hospitality, and above all, beautiful presentation; dishes are garnished with saffron, yogurt, nuts, caramelized onions or herbs.<br /><br />Beginning with spring, many seasonal fruits and veggies are incorporated, including rhubarb, onion and egg soup, lamb and rhubarb stew, fava bean and dill frittata, and rice with fava beans and dill (thankfully fresh fava beans, or “soramame,” are also a springtime staple here in Japan!). Summer finds lighter dishes using apricots, plums, cherries and mulberries, as well as chilled soups and cold salads, from the refreshing chilled yogurt and cucumber soup, rice with sour cherries, smoky eggplant dip, and zucchini with garlic, yogurt, and toasted rose petals to refreshing rosewater ice cream with pistachios and a melon and rosewater smoothie. Autumn is the season for quince, squash, pomegranates, pistachios and barberries. Heartier stews and dishes like duck in walnut sauce, lamb and dried plum steew, herbed meatballs and polos (pilavs) are rounded out with stuffed quinces, and butternut squash pancakes. Chilly winter features dried legumes, dried fruits, nuts and wheat noodles, like noodle soups, stews, hotpots, and hearty polos. The “Basics” chapter provides recipes for important elements like steamed rice, breads (taftun, barbari), salads, pickles, garnishes, and drinks.<br /><br />The food photography (styled and shot by Maryam) is absolutely stunning, with beautifully plated and arranged dishes in an explosion of color and textures. The edges of the pages feature brilliant ceramic tiles and geometric designs, while black and white family photos and scenes from everyday life give a personal touch to the beautiful food photography. Recipes include both metric and US measurements, which I greatly appreciated as I prefer to cook by weight rather than volume, particularly when baking. There is also a glossary of Persian cooking terms.<br /><br />I own numerous Persian cookbooks, and “From the Land of Nightingales and Roses” has quickly become one of my favorites due to the wide range of regional recipes, ease of finding most ingredients (I keep a fairly well stocked Persian pantry of barberries, spices, dried limes and dried herbs on hand), cultural tidbits, and beautiful photography – it is also highly accessible for vegetarians as many of the vegetable and rice dishes are vegetarian or can easily be made so. The flavor combinations are outstanding too: I loved the inclusion of currants and dates in the rice and green lentils with brown butter eggs, or the saffron potato frittata, which combines mashed potatoes, walnuts, cinnamon, and rose petals in a beautifully layered dish that also holds up well for leftovers (it reminded me of the Spanish potato omelette I used to eat as an exchange student in Spain).<br /><br />Fans of Yotam Ottolenghi, Persian, and Middle Eastern cuisine will want to add this to your collection as soon as possible – it’s as close as you can get to a food tour of Iran (which is probably outside the realm of possibility for many readers).",Positive
"I’m so happy to share my friend Rinku Battacharya’s new book “Instant Indian”; it features 100 authentic recipes from around India, including dals, idli, curries, chaat, biryani, pulao, and more! There are also recipes for paneer, no-knead naan, yogurt, and spice blends.<br /><br />I previously reviewed Rinku’s excellent “Spices and Seasons”; in recent months, I’ve jumped on the Instant Pot bandwagon and have found myself purchasing several Indian and international cookbooks designed specifically for the Instant Pot. Previously, I would avoid cooking dishes with dry beans due to the long soaking and cooking time required, but the Instant Pot handles most types of dried beans in 25 minutes or less, making it perfect for adding more protein and fiber into my diet (dried beans are also a very economical option).<br /><br />Instant Indian is divided into 11 chapters, including regions, spices and kitchen basics, make-ahead basics (homemade paneer, masala paste, spice blends, and no-knead naan), breakfast and snacks (idlis, upma, dosas), rice and noodles, legumes and soups, vegetables and paneer, fish and shrimp, chicken and eggs, lamb and pork, desserts and drinks, and chutneys and raitas. You’ll find many restaurant favorites like alu gobi, tikka masala, butter chicken, saag paneer, and yogurt lassi.<br /><br />For my review, I tested several recipes from different chapters including the tamatar masala anda, rajma with azuki beans, anda rassa, benarasi alu dum, and misthi pulao. I tested all recipes in a 3-qt. Instant Pot. The flavor of the misthi pulao was absolutely amazing due to sauteeing the spices in ghee first.<br /><br />One suggestion I’ve found helpful is it’s well worth purchasing several additional accessories for your Instant Pot: at a minimum, buy extra seals (I find the color-coded ones particularly helpful) as smells tend to linger, if you cook curries often it’s worth having a seal just for those. My other suggestion is purchasing the clear glass lid for making yogurt. The hardboiled egg stand / silicone roasting rack by OXO is great too. And if you plan on making idlis, you’ll need to purchase an idli mold that will fit inside your Instant Pot.<br /><br />Each recipe includes serving size, total time breakdown (this is important with the instant pot, as in addition to prep time you also have to factor in time for the pot to come to pressure, cooking time, and natural or manual pressure release), and whether each recipe is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian (many of the vegetarian recipes can be made vegan by swapping coconut ghee or using firm tofu for paneer). As a huge fan of chutneys (which are difficult to find and expensive in Japan), I love making my own using Rinku’s recipes (at first I used her slow cooker version, now I love the sweet and tangy pineapple chutney from Instant Indian!).<br /><br />The index is extremely user-friendly and thorough and not only includes recipes by ingredient, but also grouped by breakfast dishes, main dishes, etc.<br /><br />There are numerous delicious ideas for sauteed and curried vegetable medleys using readily available vegetables and seasonings that will add color and nutrition to every meal, and enough variety to keep me happily cooking for months. Recipes are also labelled as vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free, making it super-convenient for those who follow those diets.<br /><br />Whether you are a longtime fan of Indian cuisine or simply looking for new recipes to incorporate using your Instant Pot, “Instant Indian” is a fantastic resource that deserves a place in your kitchen!",Positive
"Some of my favorite cookbooks in my very large collection are Michele Scicolone's three slow cooker cookbooks (French Slow Cooker, Italian Slow Cooker and Mediterranean Slow Cooker). In the past, I used to use my slow cookers (a Hamilton Beach and an All-Clad) quite regularly, but the last several years I haven't had the time or have been on the go.<br /><br />This year, I finally jumped on the Instant Pot bandwagon and have slowly been increasing my confidence in my ability to get dinner on the table using it. (I have the 3-qt model, so appreciate when recipes don't have to be scaled down in order to make). I've also learned that it's better at some tasks than others (I love it for quickly cooking grains and dried beans, but still prefer to steam my veggies rather than pressure cook them). I've been experimenting with several Indian Instant Pot titles and was eager to try out the ""Instantly French"" cookbook, which features classics like French onion soup, creme brulee, Chicken Provencal, rilletes, pate, pistou, etc. to see how they fared in the pressure cooker.<br /><br />I tried several of the dishes including the French lentil salad with beets and goat cheese, roquefort walnut mini quiches, and salmon with melted leeks and whole-grain mustard. It's important to note that the Instant Pot is used to prep in some cases, but recipes may still require finishing in the oven / under the broiler. This is great, because a) it still cuts total cooking time, and b) the finished dish is crispy (which the Instant Pot will NOT deliver in pressure cooker mode).  I love the all-in-one convenience of being able to saute, simmer, and pressure cook in the same appliance!<br /><br />It was my first time trying fish in the Instant Pot (if you are cooking meats, fish, veggies regularly, you may wish to also purchase optional color-coded seals so smells don't carry over). as well as a silicone roasting trivet (I have OXOs). Don't be alarmed that cook times on fish and meat may be as short as one minute, because the pressure cooker still takes around 5 minutes to come up to pressure, and at least 10 minutes on natural release, during which time your food will continue to cook. The Salmon with Melted Leeks is going to be a regular fixture in my house; leeks are sauteed, steamed and then sour cream is stirred through, making them creamy (it reminds me of the Polish cabbage and noodles my grandmother used to make). The salmon is plated on top and finished with a dollop of mustard. There's another similar recipe for salmon with olive and almond tapenade.For meat eaters, you'll find beef in red wine, veal stew, braised pork with apples, even lamb and duck.<br /><br />I really liked that the index was in French and English as well.<br /><br />If I could make one suggestion, it would be to include some suggested sample menus on how to pair the included appetizers, soups and veggies with mains for different occasions, but overall this is quickly becoming one of my favorite Instant Post cookbooks and one that I use frequently.",Positive
"I own numerous Italian-themed dessert and baking books, and was intrigued to try ""Authentic Italian Desserts: 75 Traditional Favorites Made Easy."" True to the book's title, the included cakes, cookies, tarts, and other desserts are easy to make with common pantry ingredients. I loved some of the quick breads (called plum cakes here) using fruits, yogurt, and olive oil. The amount of sugar was also less than many American recipes and reminded me of the baked goods my Polish grandmother used to make. I've really enjoyed the recipes I've tried so far (including the apple and cinnamon bread) and look forward to baking my way through this over the coming months!",Positive
"An absolutely lovely collection of historic African American standards alongside modern interpretations, you'll find beloved favorites like buttermilk fried chicken, greens with potlikker, fried fish, shrimp and grits, cornbread, and cobblers, but just as delicious are the vintage photographs showing early food vendors and tidbits of African-American culinary history. Arranged by geographic area, there are notes about original ingredients and modern substitions. Based on recipes from the Sweet Home Cafe at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, I was surprised that some of my childhood favorites I grew up with in Michigan (seafood cakes / salmon cakes) were also apparently a staple (where they would even be repurposed into other meals. Using fresh Lake Superior whitefish, I combined the recipes for the seafood cakes and the salmon croquettes with great success; the recipes are straightforward in ingredients and technique but deliver a great deal of flavor. This is a book that I've enjoyed reading cover to cover for the stories and rich cultural legacy as much as for the recipes themselves, which come highly recommended.",Positive
"I recently joined the Instant Pot believers after seeing this product typed extensively on Facebook.  As an owner of the Instant Pot Mini who is cooking for one, it is difficult to find recipes on a smaller scale for the smaller Instant Pot.  At first I was a bit hesitant as the sample recipe on Amazon featured prepared products, but the recipes in the cookbook itself are actually from scratch for the most part.  There is a good range of variety in the included recipes,",Positive
"Berlin-based Meike Peters’ lifelong love of food was instilled in her by her mother and grandmothers. Rooted in German comfort food, her style has also embraced French and Italian cuisine as well as her partner’s Maltese and American traditions. Her blog (and cookbook) Eat In My Kitchen has collected hundreds of beautiful, vegetable-forward recipes that highlight seasonal ingredients, using a minimum of preparation to enhance the delicate textures and flavors of the various seasonal fruits and veggies they showcase. “Eat In My Kitchen” was just named the James Beard Foundation’s top General Cooking title of 2017, and rightfully so!<br /><br />Kicking off with salads, you’ll find a wide range of tempting plates such as the fennel and melon carpaccio with chervil, cucumber, arugula, and orange salad with turmeric and mint, roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes with burrata, lemon and basil, Radicchio, peach, and roasted shallot salad with blue cheese, and red cabbage and pomegranate salad with candied walnuts and rosemary. I made several of these for quick and easy weeknight suppers, and was impressed by both their appearance (beautiful), ease of assembly, and the wide range of flavors and textures coaxed from a minimum of fuss. The melon and fennel carpaccio made a fantastic light dinner alongside a glass of sparkling rose; the contrast between the crunch of the fennel, juicy melon and bright herbal notes from the chervil was a lovely surprise.<br /><br />Vegetarians will find many outstanding dishes ready-made for them, including the salad chapter as well as many lovely pastas (Maltese lemon and ricotta pasta with basil, cicero e tria, wild mushroom spaghetti with orange butter and crispy sage, pumpkin gnocchi with Roquefort sauce), mains (grilled eggplant, ricotta, chickpea and poached egg tartine, torta al testo with lemon-rosemary lentil burgers and mozzarella di buffala, roasted shallot, caramelized plum, and stilton tartine with rosemary, roasted garlic and tomato focaccia sandwich with rosemary oil), basalmic strawberry, chevre, and pistachio tartine).<br /><br />Meat, poultry and seafood lovers will be delighted to find treasures such as the Bavarian beer-roasted pork with sweet potatoes and parsnips, Riesling and elderflower chicken with apricots, slow-roasted duck with ginger, honey and orange, Maltese tuna and spinach pie, and swordfish with mint, tomatoes and lemon-caper oil.<br /><br />Meike also touches on sweet and savory baking, from Gozitan pizza and a beautiful pear and blue cheese tart with rosemary to German-inspired bakes (Frankfurter krantz, cardamom kipferl, Donauwelle, butter Buchtel buns), Mediterranean-inspired recipes (polenta-almond cake with rosewater-vanilla syrup, Maltese bread pudding, lemon ricotta cannoli), and a glorious strawberry-ricotta cheesecake with oat cookie crust.<br /><br />The beauty of Meike’s recipes is in their simplicity; with few exceptions, most recipes call for a mere handful of ingredients and straightforward prep. “To cook, to bake, to eat, and to treat is my daily feast,” she writes. Ingredients are listed in US as well as metric measurements, a fact which I greatly appreciate as I prefer to cook and bake in metric (weight) rather than US volume measurements as I feel it results in more accurate dishes. She also recommends using organic produce and ingredients whenever possible, preferably homegrown in the case of herbs. As fresh ricotta is difficult to come by here in Japan, I make my own Meyer lemon ricotta using the basic recipe from “One-Hour Cheese.” The resulting dishes are light, refreshing, and capture the essence of breezy summer days.<br /><br /> Homemade preserves will enhance your breakfasts and bakes with love, from elderflower syrup (used in the panna cotta recipe as well as a great enhancement for cocktails), spicy rhubarb chutney, Moroccan preserved lemons, and vegetable broth.<br /><br />And one of my favorite features is the “Meet in Your Kitchen,” section, which includes recipes from Yossy Arefi (“Sweeter off the Vine” and her blog “Apt. 2B Baking Co.”), television host Cynthia Barcomi, salt producers the Cini Family, Malin Elmlid of The Bread Exchange, Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, and blogger / author Molly Yeh (whose cookbook “Molly on the Range” was one of my Top Cookbooks of 2016).<br /><br />Because after all, the deepest, truest connections of food and taste are when we share the fruits of our labors with those we love – food as not merely sustenance, but as a springboard for leisurely conversations and taking a moment to slow down and savor in an all-too-hectic world.<br /><br />Congratulations to Meike for winning her James Beard award and congratulations on a fantastic cookbook!",Positive
"As a huge fan of Persian cuisine and novels such as [[ASIN:0812972481 Pomegranate Soup: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1565129571 Maman's Homesick Pie: A Persian Heart in an American Kitchen]], I eagerly dove into &#34;The Temporary Bride,&#34; not realizing at first that it was in fact autobiographical. Jennifer Klinec, the daughter of hardscrabble Eastern European immigrants, grew up in a rural Ontario town and longed to see (and more importantly, taste) all the mysteries that the world had to offer. Independent from a young age, she moved between Swiss boarding school and an Irish college, a bank job in London, a food writer and and hands-on cooking around the globe (including Yemen and Syria) before chasing her dreams to Iran. Having operated a cooking school out of her London home, she at times finds so many restrictions chafing (women must wear a headscarf at all times, travel in a separate section of the bus, stand in separate lines, and are subject to scrutiny and inspections by the religious police, not to mention sexual harassment in the street).<br /><br />But Jennifer ends up signing up for something she hadn't bargained for: she falls in love with her host family's gruff son and becomes a temporary bride, marrying a man she's only known for three weeks. Vahid indulged her culinary curiosity by granting her access to every corner of Iran's foodways, introducing her to local specialties, and opening doors that would have otherwise been closed to her as a foreign woman, including an ill-fated visit to an abbatoir. The two began a whirlwind courtship. Living in rural Yadz, Jennifer and Vahid were under intense scrutiny by pretty much everyone, stealing kisses and hurried trysts in alleyways and in Jennifer's hotel room.<br /><br />Such temporary Sigheh marriages are ways to get around Iran's strict ban on extra-marital sex; some view them as legalized prostitution, while for Jennifer and Vahid, it offered a chance at normalcy.<br /><br />The writing is gorgeous, particularly the heady descriptions of savory stews and the chopping, peeling and food preparation; I felt like I had found a soulmate as I've had a similar love for Persian, Middle Eastern and Central Asian dishes since childhood and feel most alive and at home in foreign kitchens. Iran has long been a place I've dreamed of visiting and cooking my way around, and reading Jennifer's gorgeous prose brought modern Iran to vibrant life. I devoured the entire book in a day, and certainly look forward to reading more works by Jennifer!",Positive
"Kelly Kwok, founder of &#34;Life Made Sweeter,&#34; has unlocked the secret to delicious restaurant-style stir fries, noodles, curries, and desserts just like those you get from your favorite Chinese, Thai, or Korean restaurants, but without the sinkful of dirty dishes and piles of pots and pans! You'll find all your Chinese favorites like Beef and Broccoli, General Tso's Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Lo Mein along with Galbi (Korean-style short ribs), Thai curries, Bahn mi, tom yum, pho, fried rice, noodle dishes, sides and desserts.<br /><br />Most of these qualify as one-pot dishes (despite the title, not all involve the slow cooker), making prep and cleanup easy. Ingredients are listed in both US and metric equivalents, and most ingredients should be readily available at your grocery store. Each recipe has a gorgeous full-color photo as well. The sauces in particular are standouts, even more so considering that relatively few ingredients are used (so no trips to the Chinese/Oriental supermarket trying to track down hard-to-find sauces and pastes).<br /><br />As a vegetarian, I loved the Asian-inspired soups like the Thai pumpkin curry soup, miso soup with vegetables and soba noodles, and Chinese hot and sour soup. There is a whole chapter devoted to meatless mains, including a vegetarian mapodofu, Thai red curry vegetables, Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce, General Tso's Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes, and Thai basil tofu and vegetable rice casserole.<br /><br /> THAI BUTTERNUT SQUASH CURRY SOUP<br /><br />YIELD: 4–5 SERVINGS<br /><br />5 cups (2250 g) butternut squash (or pumpkin), peeled and cubed<br />1 cup (200 g) sweet potatoes, peeled, roughly cubed<br />1 medium onion, peeled, diced<br />1 tbsp (8 g) fresh ginger, peeled<br />3 garlic cloves, sliced<br />3 cups (710 ml) chicken or vegetable broth<br />1 (13.5-oz [400-ml]) can coconut milk<br />½–1 tbsp (8–16 g) red curry paste, to taste<br />½ tsp turmeric<br />1 tbsp (15 ml) fresh lime juice<br />Salt and pepper, to taste<br />Drizzle of coconut milk, for garnish (optional)<br />Pumpkin seeds, for garnish (optional)<br />Chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)<br />Sliced red chili pepper, for garnish (optional)<br /><br />Place the squash, sweet potatoes, onion, ginger, garlic and broth in a 4- to 5-quart (3.8- to 4.7-L) slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours, until the squash and sweet potatoes are soft and cooked through.<br /><br />Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, red curry paste, turmeric and lime juice. Allow the soup to cool slightly before pur&eacute;eing. Using an immersion blender, pur&eacute;e directly in the slow cooker or pour contents into a blender and pur&eacute;e until smooth. Adjust seasonings as needed with salt and pepper.<br /><br />Serve warm in bowls and garnish with a drizzle of coconut milk, pumpkin seeds, cilantro and sliced red chili pepper, if desired.<br /><br />I love that so many of the ingredients are readily available; nothing is more frustrating than finding a dish that looks great, but not being able to locate specialty ingredients (especially true with some Chinese and Asian cookbooks).<br /><br />The addition of desserts was a nice touch as I love to use my slow cooker for desserts (I also highly recommend Michele Scicolone's &#34;The Mediterranean Slow Cooker&#34; for its desserts chapter). Here you'll find a mandarin orange cheesecake, Asian pear pudding cake, black sesame brownies, Chinese steamed sponge cake, ginger tea poached pears, Lunar New Year sweet rice cake, mango coconut tapioca pudding, matcha green tea cake, sweet green bean soup, and Thai coconut sticky rice with mango.<br /><br />Here is Kelly's recipe for Black Sesame Brownies: the ground black sesame seeds lend an almost peanut-butter-like depth.<br /><br /> BLACK SESAME BROWNIES<br />YIELD: 10 SERVINGS<br />1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour<br />¼ cup (30 g) unsweetened cocoa powder<br />2 tsp (5 g) black sesame powder or finely ground black sesame seeds<br />¾ tsp baking powder<br />¼ tsp salt<br />½ cup (58 g) unsalted butter<br />½ cup (90 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />1 cup (225 g) sugar<br />3 large eggs, lightly beaten<br />1 tsp pure vanilla extract<br />½ cup (90 g) semi-sweet mini chocolate chips, plus more for topping, if desired<br /><br />Take a long piece of aluminum foil and fold it lengthwise into a long strip. Press it along the inside perimeter of your slow cooker, creating a ring. This will prevent the edges from burning. Next, line the bottom with a piece of parchment, leaving an overhang on the sides for easier removal.<br />In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sesame powder, baking powder and salt.<br /><br />Place the butter and chocolate chips in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high power for 30-second increments, stirring well after each, until completely smooth and melted. Whisk in the sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one by one, then add the vanilla.<br /><br />Slowly stir in the flour mixture until just combined; do NOT overmix. Fold in the mini chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the lined slow cooker and smooth out using a rubber spatula. Top with additional chocolate chips if desired.<br /><br />Cover the slow cooker with a double layer of paper towels then place the lid securely over the towels. This prevents any water from dripping into the cake batter.<br /><br />Cook on low for 21⁄2 to 3 hours, then remove the cover and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the insert from the slow cooker and allow to cool completely. Lift the parchment paper to remove the brownies and slice into squares.<br /><br />Kelly has also provided a handy guide to browning, cuts of meat, layering, sizes and brands of slow cookers, and general tips. In addition, a section on the Asian pantry includes a brief overview of staples such as black bean sauce / paste, sambal oelek, coconut milk, doenjang, dried chilis, fish sauce, spices, and other seasonings that you'll need to create the dishes in &#34;The Asian Slow Cooker.&#34;<br /><br />Verdict: If you love Asian cuisine but think you don't have the time to create it at home, think again! &#34;The Asian Slow Cooker&#34; will have you throwing out your takeout menus in favor of easy homemade versions with far fewer additives, plus there is enough variety and range of Asian cuisines (Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean) to keep you happily cooking for months to come. Happy (slow) cooking!<br /><br />(Thank you to YC Media for permission to reprint recipes and photos from The Asian Slow Cooker!)",Positive
"As a longtime fan of Persian and Indian cuisines, I was intrigued when I saw my friend Marlene Spieler mention Niloufer Mavalvala's &#34;The Art of Parsi Cooking.&#34; Despite my familiarity with Persian and some regional Indian cuisines, I was not familiar with Parsi culture. The Parsi are followers of the Prophet Zarathushtra. The Parsi (from the word &#34;Pars,&#34; Iran), are Zoroastrians who migrated to India between the 8th to 10th centuries, and later their descendants who settled around the globe. Parsi cooking was largely shaped by Iran and India, and you'll find that both cultures feature prominently in Parsi dishes, from dry fruit and nuts (Shirini) lending sweetness to more pungent ginger, garlic, chilies and spices from India. The trinity of tikhu-khatu-mithu (spicy-sour-sweet) forms the underpinnings of Parsi cuisine.<br /><br />The included dishes in &#34;The Art of Parsi Cooking&#34; are arranged by course, from appetizers such as scrambled eggs with spices and prawns in spices and beloved side dishes like eggs on potatoes, okra or tomatoes and fish with green chutney in banana leaves to main dishes like shrimp coconut curry and rice, chicken curry with vegetable palau, Sunday lamb roast, and chicken almond and yogurt curry. And of course, what meal is complete without a spot of dessert? You'll find the famous Parsi wedding dish of  Lagan nu Custard and almond and rice pudding to Parsi kulfi (burnt milk ice-cream with pistachio and almond) and ravo (semolina and egg pudding). Teatime snacks also offer a nice light pick-me-up, including butter biscuits, cake, and sweet pancakes. A discussion of spice blends is also included. Best of all, many of the spices and ingredients should be readily available in your local supermarket or Amazon (I've tried to cook from some &#34;authentic&#34; Indian cookbooks where I couldn't locate any of the regional veggies or obscure ingredients, so this is a huge relief!).<br /><br />Each beautifully illustrated recipe comes with helpful tips, and I love that the book was printed with large, bold font for ingredients, making it easy to see and cook from. I loved the brown rice recipe; not to be confused with whole grain rice, this is basmati rice that gets its color from caramelized onions and is delicately spiced with cinnamon, cloves, peppercorn, and cardamom. The baked goods were also a fascinating and delicious departure from more syrupy, often-too-sweet Indian desserts such as gulab jamun; I loved the light, semolina-enhanced kumas and the delicately-spiced butter cookies.<br /><br />As we move into fall and winter's chill, I look forward to cooking my way through more of these delicious, warming dishes that have sustained generations of Parsi cooks and families.",Positive
"Several years ago, a fellow cookbook collector gifted me a copy of Ana Sortun's excellent [[ASIN:0060792280 Spice: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean]], and I fell instantly and madly in love. Sortun is the executive chef behind Oleana and Sofra. Classically trained at La Varenne, she decided to incorporate Mediterranean spices and the mezze mentality after studying in Turkey. Sofra Cafe and Bakery opened in 2008 and serves mezze and baked goods from Turkey, Lebanon, and Greece, all of which are amply represented in &quot;Soframiz.&quot;<br /><br />I've long admired Turkish cuisine and have collected numerous books on the subject (including recent releases [[ASIN:1743368577 Istanbul Cult Recipes]], [[ASIN:1849496633 Eat Istanbul: A Journey to the Heart of Turkish Cuisine]], and [[ASIN:1743360495 Anatolia: Adventures in Turkish Cooking]]), so when I heard that Ana and Maura Kilpatrick were coming out with a Sofra cookbook, I was ecstatic. I've had the galley for several months, and have made numerous recipes from the book, including the spicy tomato bulgur salad, stuffed simit, Persian carrot and black eyed pea salad, and tahini shortbread cookies.<br /><br />The recipes include breakfast, meze, flatbreads, savory pies, cookies and confections, specialty pastries, cakes and desserts, and beverages. If you've never experienced a Turkish (or Israeli) breakfast, you're in for a treat; traditional breakfast spreads include many small bowls and plates of olives, tahini, stuffed flatbreads, egg dishes, vegetables and cheeses taking up the entire table. Breakfast at Sofra includes such staples as Shakshuka (baked eggs with spicy tomato sauce), rolled omelet with za'atar and labne, flower pogaca rolls, date orange brioche tart, pistachio toaster pastries with rosewater glaze, and morning buns iwth orange blossom glaze.<br /><br />The meze really shine and make for inspired snacking or afternoon pick-me-ups, from the whipped cheese spreads and hummus to hearty and healthy bean-based salads (Persian carrot and black-eyed peas, Egyptian-style pea salad with walnuts, barley and chickpea salad, yellow split peas with za'atar spiced almonds). I made several for this review and all were definite repeats.<br /><br />My true passion is baking, so the breads and baked goods were the real test. My first disappointment was that measurements are only given in volume, not weight; as a serious home baker, I much prefer the precision of weighing my flours, particularly as I live in an extremely humid climate (which affects the weight of flour). I also had some issues with several of the bread recipes I tried; the stuffed simit featured on the cover calls for 1 cup water to 2 1/4 cups of flour, and what initially greeted me was almost like pancake batter. I continued to add flour by the tablespoon, as well as a little olive oil, and eventually had a very soft (but workable) dough that was wonderfully moist. The Turkish method of brushing with pekmez (grape molasses) lends a sweet finish to the savory filling of feta and za'atar spiced almonds and the toasted sesame seed topping. The bread is delicious on its own or as an accompaniment to the salads in the book.<br /><br />Fans of Middle Eastern pastries will be in heaven; from pistachio bird's nests (a recipe I have not encountered in my many other Turkish books) to Persian love cake, kunefe, umm Ali with caramelized apples, chocolate hazelnut baklava, brown butter pecan pie with espresso dates, date espresso ma'amoul, and milky walnut-fig baklava, this is a baker's paradise.<br /><br />I encountered an issue with the tahini shortbread cookies, which calls for 2 tsp salt; I cross-checked the recipe on the internet, and the online version I found also called for 2 tsp. salt. My baker's instinct told me to start with much less; I went with 1/2 tsp salt, which is what most of the other cookie and shortbread recipes in &quot;Soframiz&quot; called for, and I'm certainly glad I didn't use the full amount as they would have been too salty for my taste. Also, I followed the recipe to the letter, and ended up with more like 3 or 4 dozen cookies. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup toasted sesame seeds but you are only instructed to use 1/4 cup. The resulting cookies were absolutely delicious and would be fantastic as part of a cheese tray as the sesame lends a savory edge.<br /><br />Gorgeous matte photography and clear, large font make this a pleasure to read and cook from (I prefer matte pages as it means no glare in my cookbook holder). I loved the recipes I tried, but found in several instances that there are small errors, so be sure to read through the entire recipe in advance and make note if an ingredient is mentioned that is not in the list, or an amount seems off.<br /><br />Overall &quot;Soframiz&quot; is one of my top cookbook picks for 2016 (I'll be releasing my 2016 cookbook roundup in the next month or two), and one that fans of Turkish, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine will certainly want to add to their collections.",Positive
"Some of these I've seen before through Cook's Illustrated hacks and the like (using a Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with no mess), and some fall on the &#34;less practical&#34; side (like using foil as a roasting pan; if you're attempting to bake anything remotely heavy / messy, the foil will buckle and spill when you try to pull the whole thing out of the oven unless you're using a cake lifter under it - been there, made that mistake!).<br /><br />But for those with tiny or underequipped kitchens (including rental houses on vacation), there are some great lifesavers here that will still enable you to bake, poach, broil, etc., using repurposed kitchen items (foil, cake pans, etc.), along with simple recipes that illustrate / use the aforementioned techniques.",Positive
"I own and have reviewed several (unofficial) Trader Joe’s cookbooks and cook from all of them regularly, so was excited to see “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s Cookbook.” It’s no secret that one of my favorite stores on the planet is Trader Joe’s. I first discovered them while still living in Michigan, and it would be an eight-year wait before my city in Texas got their first store (in the meantime, I would smuggle home suitcases full of TJ’s manna-like cookie butter and dried fruit). Although I currently live 8,000 miles away from the nearest store (and will for the next several years), I have a hefty supply of shelf-stable TJ’s products that friends and family are kind enough to send in care packages.<br /><br />So I was excited to see the new release “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s Cookbook: Over 75 Easy, Delicious Recipes for Every Meal.” A freelance illustrator, author Bonnie Matthews was hit hard by the economic downturn in 2008  and also saw the end to a seven-year relationship. She had gotten up to nearly 300 pounds before deciding that she needed to change; she started cooking healthier meals using Trader Joe’s products and eventually lost 130 pounds through a combination of healthier eating and working out. Her employee discount at Trader Joe’s meant that she had the chance to create delicious recipes that would let her stick to her newfound healthy lifestyle: “I had to make peace with food and make better choices or I knew that I would not be able to survive.” Dr. Oz dubbed Bonnie a “Wellness Warrior” on his show and gave Bonnie a blog on DoctorOz.com; this launched her journey as a cookbook author.<br /><br />Something that my loyal readers may not be aware of is that I lost and have kept off around 35 pounds for the last 15 years. Starting in junior high and high school, I began to pack on the pounds onto my 5’1” frame through a combination of junk food, soda, candy, and lack of exercise. In high school I weighed about 125; by the time I earned my BA from Western Michigan in 2003, that number had ballooned to over 140 and I barely fit into a size 12. I had finally had enough and changed my habits (and diet) drastically; I started to exercise every day, cut out regular sodas, stopped eating fast food, switched to whole grains, fresh vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and gradually adopted a vegetarian (now pescetarian) diet. In a matter of months, I’d dropped over 30 pounds. Some of that weight had crept back over the last 10 years in Texas (in large part because of the extreme heat, lack of sidewalks, and places to exercise outside), but last year I finally got back down to my grad school weight that I hadn’t seen since 2006.<br /><br />The gorgeous photography (which Bonnie also shot) and easy-to-read font make this easy to cook from; number of servings can be found on the upper-left-hand side, with a full-color photo for each recipe appearing to the right. There are lots of international influences to keep dinner interesting, from Moroccan-inspired tagines to Greek chicken with eggplant and onion, Thai red curry with roasted kabocha squash and shrimp, pork tenderloin medallions with rosemary marinade, and pasta dishes. Each recipe comes with a brief introduction from Bonnie with additional tips, tricks, and info about specific ingredients. Although the recipes rely on shortcuts (TJ’s frozen veggies, sauces, etc), there are minimal highly-processed ingredients. Because of this, prep times are very reasonable, with many of the main dishes on the table in 30 minutes or less.<br /><br />Whether you’re looking to make a healthier lifestyle change or are simply looking for new ideas for delicious, healthy weeknight meals, “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s” truly has something for everyone!",Positive
"Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France, Italy, Mexico, Israel, and North America, you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs, lasagna bolognaise, and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).<br /><br />I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”), but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.<br /><br />The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes, including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto),  ravioli, Tuscan bean and farro soup, veal scallopini, brachiole, (fried) pizza Napolitana, ragu Napolitano, and lasagna, but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs, spicy kim chee hangar steaks,  ramen, chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas, ceviche, and pulled beef tacos.<br /><br />The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light, refreshing salads for nearly every meal, and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot, hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad, Lumina market salad, Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!), kale squash Caesar salad, root vegetable apple salad, and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes, haricots verts, and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy, you can add crumbled feta while warm).<br /><br />Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken, Amalfi sage chicken, and mustard caper chicken, and the meat dishes include various roasts, grills, and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall, while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding, farroto, pasta frittata, and risotto, while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon, layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka; having taught many students from Georgia, I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping; save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.<br /><br />Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter, including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo), tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before), sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce, chestnut tomato quinoa, and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu, Beresheet Spa Kanafe, banana, date, and pecan cake, almond bobka ring, halvah baklava, and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder.<br />Recipes are clearly labeled as meat, dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus, seviche for ceviche, bobka for babka, etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons, turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze, and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces), but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart, fish dishes, and veggie sides).<br /><br />Overall, “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500,000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen; Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions, from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day, in Susie’s words, “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”<br /><br />(Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!)",Positive
"Nearly ten years ago to the day, I embarked on my present career as an adult EFL / ESL instructor. Freshly minted from grad school with my MA TESOL in hand, I began teaching English to students from over 100 countries, some of which I didn’t even know existed (particularly the Caucasus and Central Asia, as we never really studied world geography much in school). My very first ESL class included a lovely captain from Azerbaijan (who, coincidentally, I ran into again last year as a repeat student and we recognized each other instantly!). One of my favorite aspects of my job is the cultural exchange; I’ve learned about traditional Kyrgyz music and clothing, Mongolia’s nomadic culture, Afghan cuisine, Saudi Arabia’s oral poetry tradition (another student was a finalist on Saudi Arabia’s televised poetry competition “Million’s Poet”), Taiwanese holidays,  Georgian winemaking, and Azerbaijan’s rich cultural heritage and culinary delights. Several of my colleagues spent six months teaching in Baku, and I was fascinated by the colorful embroidery, photos and stories they brought back.<br /><br />So imagine my delight when I learned of Feride Buyuran’s “Pomegranates and Saffron,” which won the prestigious Gourmand’s “Best In The World” title in 2015 along with several other major awards. I have hundreds of cookbooks on international cuisine, but had never really explored Azerbaijani cuisine before. Due to its geographic location, Azerbaijan’s foodways unsurprisingly include influences from neighboring Iran, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia and Russia. This has resulted in a vibrant, colorful cuisine that combines the best of all these cultures: cooling yogurt soups, meltingly tender kebabs, stuffed grape leaves and vegetables, jeweled saffron plovs (pilafs) piled high and gleaming like a king’s ransom, and silky rice puddings, delicate almond cookies and syrup-soaked desserts. I also loved the addition of entire chapters devoted to pickled vegetables (turshu) and preserves, a common fixture on the Azerbaijani table.<br /><br />Feride immigrated to the US about 15 years ago; interested in recipes from a young age, she began to recreate the tastes she missed from home, and the seeds for “Pomegranates and Saffron” were sown. Feride and her family take trips back to Azerbaijan every few years, where she has the chance to travel the country trying regional specialties and documenting Azerbaijan’s food culture. The final book is the result of more than six years spent researching, testing, traveling and photographing dishes and everyday life across Azerbaijan, and this labor of love shines through on every gorgeous glossy page.<br /><br />“Pomegranates and Saffron” contains 200 diverse recipes for appetizers and salads, soups and stews, pasta, meat, vegetable and egg dishes, breads, pilafs, drinks, and desserts, all adapted with Western kitchens in mind. The book opens with an introduction that includes an overview of Azerbaijan’s legendary hospitality, holidays (particularly Novruz), and food traditions, then plunges into appetizers. Here there are many similarities to Persian cuisine, including the heavy use of fresh herbs and many lovely vegetable salads and relishes (eggplant “caviar,” garlicky eggplant dip, and salad Olivier (the “Capital Salad,” which I first discovered in Spain as an exchange student in 2002). I love nothing better than to make an entire meal by creating a spread of several appetizers with freshly baked bread, particularly during the hot, hazy days of summer.<br /><br />Azerbaijan’s soups vary depending on the season; in the colder winter months, people seek solace in heartier pasta soups and stews like dushbere, khemirashi and mash shorbasi, while in summer light and refreshing yogurt soups are served, including doghramaj and dovgha. Lamb, beef, and poultry dishes are sure to delight with various kebabs and stews (including a variation of fesenjoon), while fish preparations are delightfully fresh and uncomplicated (salmon kebabs, pan-fried fish patties, fish stuffed with fresh herbs). Vegetarians will relish the kukus (egg and vegetable omelettes), fried, grilled and baked vegetables, and pasta dishes. As I am primarily a baker, I particularly enjoyed the chapter on breads and pastries, including the shorgoghal, decorated flaky bread, walnut and onion and bean and potato breads, and tendir bread (which, like Georgia, is essentially a tandoor oven).<br /><br />Over the past couple of months, I’ve tried making several of the recipes in “Pomegranates and Saffron,” including the dill and fava bean pilaf (fava beans are in season here), yogurt soup, and half-moon dumplings with a butternut squash filling. The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out and easy to follow; for more complicated recipes, the step-by-step photos were invaluable. I loved the dumpling filling in particular (I used kabocha with ground walnuts and cinnamon) and am experimenting with using it in other dishes. As it was my first try making tahdig (the golden, crispy rice crust on the bottom of the pot, my results were not picture-perfect but the flavor and texture were indescribable; I can now see why families fight over who gets the crispy goodness at the bottom of the pot! And I first boiled then pan-fried the dumplings in butter, which is how my Polish grandmother always made pierogi.<br /><br />I loved learning about Azerbaijani kitchen tools such as the saj grill, traditional pasta boards, and terra cotta bread stamps. As a linguist and keen student of culture, I also loved that nearly every recipe comes with an Azerbaijani food proverb (“Words of Wisdom”) in Azeri and English (Azeri is closely related to Turkish). I particularly loved the food proverbs as one of the assignments I always give my international students is to teach the rest of the class a proverb from their country, then see if there is a similar one in English; the next time I have students from Azerbaijan, I have many new proverbs to ask them about!<br /><br />Each recipe is illustrated with a beautiful full-color photograph (some step by step) that showcases beautiful Azeri embroidery, place settings and tools. Each recipe intro and chapter heading gives further information into Azeri culture and food traditions, especially regional ones. A detailed bibliography and additional resources into culture, language, and literature and folklore are also provided.<br /><br />“Pomegranates and Saffron” is a gorgeous cookbook that deserves every award it is up for; the stunning photography, rich cultural background, and the physical book itself (oversized, with a red satin bookmark) will immerse you in the sights and smells of Azerbaijan’s rich culinary history. The book is available through Feride’s website, which also includes a wealth of cultural info on Azerbaijan, online shopping, and the recipes featured in the book plus more.",Positive
"An accomplished writer and artist, Linda Dalal Sawaya’s family immigrated from Douma, Lebanon to Detroit in 1926; her grandmother Dalal and mother Alice Ganamey Sawaya, mother of five, grandmother of seven, great-grandmother of nine, soon became famous for their cooking, and as the youngest of five daughters, Linda later became their kitchen assistant. In “Alice’s Kitchen” (now in its fourth edition), Linda lovingly collects family portraits, memories, and over 100 traditional Lebanese dishes including mezza, salads, kebabs, stuffed veggies, and delicate desserts that capture the essence of Lebanon’s healthful, veggie-centric cuisine in a simple, easily approachable format. In addition, a portion of the proceeds benefits the children of Lebanon.<br /><br />Linda, her artwork, and “Alice’s Kitchen” were featured prominently in an issue of the excellent magazine “Aramco World,” and Linda was kind enough to send a copy of the issue “Memories of a Lebanese Garden,” which features stunning cover paintings of the author and her mother in a garden filled with classic Lebanese imagery and produce as well as full-page paintings of scenes from Douma, the author learning to toss bread in the air like her mother and grandmother before her, family portraits, and illustrated ingredients for the featured recipes (‘ihjee, sambusak, mujaddrah, kusah mahshi, salatat bandurah Elis).<br /><br />Linda’s grandmother Dalal had lived through WWI, rationing, single parenting and a historic earthquake before joining her husband in Detroit; having survived these hardships, she taught her children and grandchildren the art of recycling, conversation and not wasting even a single grain of rice. Moving to the US meant that new culinary skills had to be learned – where the town butcher in Douma had previously prepared various cuts of lamb, this was a luxury not available in 1950s Los Angeles, so Alice and Dalal learned to cut legs of lamb for various dishes, and how to bake their own bread (huge, paper-thin loaves). Linda grew up surrounded by an abundance of food, prepared not only for the family but also any visitors that happened to drop by, a hallmark of Lebanese hospitality. Her family kept a small kitchen garden where they grew mint, purslane, squash, grape leaves, and figs.<br /><br />Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Alice, I feel as though I know her through reading Linda’s stories and through the black and white photographs; my own grandmother was named Alice and also immigrated to Michigan (in my case, from Poland in 1913). She similarly preserved and passed down her heritage through her love of cooking and feeding family, so “Alice’s Kitchen” resonated deeply with me on many levels far beyond a simple culinary connection. As a child, I remember my grandmother recounting arriving at Ellis Island; when I finally made it to Ellis Island in 1914 during a job interview in NYC, it was a highly charged emotional moment to see it from the ferry for the first time, just as my grandmother must have seen it. Now as an adult, I am attempting to reconnect with my immigrant heritage by trying to recapture the taste of my grandmother’s home cooking. (Unlike Linda, I was not fortunate enough to preserve my grandmother’s recipes or to learn from her in the kitchen while she was still alive).<br /><br />Having grown up surrounded by her family’s Lebanese cuisine in Los Angeles, Linda had the chance to finally experience Lebanon’s culture and legendary hospitality for herself during a three-month sojourn in 1971. Suddenly familiar rituals and flavors that she’d taken for granted took on new meaning; the artistry that her mother Alice incorporated was evident in every dish. This first encounter with Lebanon transformed her life and provided the starting point for “Alice’s Kitchen.”<br /><br />Opening with a very helpful guide to “About the Recipes,” you’ll find a section on curing olives and pickling (green, black, pickled turnips and vegetables), homemade cheese, yogurt and butter (including Arabic cheese, labne, and clarified butter), sauces (yogurt garlic, tahini, za’atar with olive oil). Salads are probably my favorite part of Lebanese cuisine, and you’ll find familiar favorites like fattoush and tabbouli alongside Salatat Elias (tomato salad with garlic and spearmint), yogurt and cucumber, and Lebanese potato salad.<br /><br />As lamb is a central component to many Lebanese dishes, there is an excellent illustrated guide to breaking down various cuts (leg, breast, shoulder) and many excellent serving suggestions (shish kebab, grilled ground lamb, meat pies, and the national dish, kibbe nayye (raw minced lamb and bulgur). Chicken and fish dishes will give you additional ideas for mains.<br /><br />Being vegetarian, of course my favorite section was vegetarian entrees and vegetables, beans, and grains. Lebanese cuisine lends itself particularly well to vegetarian dishes such as mjaddrah (lentils and rice with caramelized onions, fatayir (spinach pies), ‘ijjeh (omelette with parsley, mint and onion), summer squash stuffed with rice, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, falafel and vegetarian kibbe. As a fan of both pumpkin and bulgur, the kibbet jlunt (baked pumpkin and bulgur with pine nuts) was a revelation. Her version of Mhammara (grilled red pepper and walnut dip) is superb; just the right degree of tart (from lemon juice and pomegranate molasses) with a little kick from the chili paste (I used Tunisian harissa), this addictive dip goes perfectly with veggies, pita, feta, and basically anything you can think of! And you’ll find the full range of wonderful Middle Eastern desserts, from walnut ma’amoul, ‘atayif (crepes with cheese or walnut filling), knafe, a delicately spiced rice pudding, and baklava rounded out with suggested drinks. There’s even a section on homemade preserves and fruit leathers (fig jam with aniseed and walnuts, quince, apricot, and pumpkin and carrot infused with rose geranium petals.<br /><br />Recipe names are given in transliterated Arabic as well as English (Arabic titles are listed in italics in the index). Each recipe is introduced with a brief background into the dish, its importance in traditional Lebanese cuisine or preparation and serving tips, and family stories and traditions. A handy glossary breaks down Arabic terms for cooking, tools, ingredients, terms of endearments and hospitality, and sample menus for breakfast, lunch, mezza, dinner, and more.<br /><br />Here is Linda’s fabulous recipe for Mhammara:<br /><br />3 red bell peppers, roasted or grilled until blackened (I used one jar drained roasted red peppers)<br />1 cup walnuts<br />1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses<br />1 tablespoon chili paste (I used harissa)<br />3 cloves of garlic<br />2 tablespoons lemon juice<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional – I skipped it)<br />2 tablespoons sesame seeds (I used toasted)<br />2 tablespoons bread crumbs (or more as needed)<br /><br />1. Place whole red peppers over a grill, or broil until blackened. This takes only a few minutes. Put hot peppers into a paper bag and close to cool. This makes them easy to peel. Under running water, remove all the blackened skin. Cut in half and remove seeds. Juices from the peppers can be used in the dip.<br />2. Put peppers and all of the remaining ingredients into a food processor and pulse just until the consistency is minced but not pureed.<br />3. Taste and add seasonings or bread crumbs as needed. Serve with Arabic bread, pita chips, or crackers.<br />Makes 2 cups of dip, serving 8 to 10 for appetizers.<br /><br />Overall, Alice’s Kitchen is a book I will be turning to again and again to make the most of summer’s bounty through simple, delicious recipes that preserve the unique flavors of the fruits and veggies that star in them.<br /><br />As Linda so eloquently puts it, the appeal of traditional Lebanese cuisine is that “Our tradition is about living gently on the earth. Using resources of the earth respectfully. Sharing and preparing food with love. Eating what is in season. Growing our own food as much as possible. Living simply and richly. Honoring the earth. Honoring ourselves and each other. This is my gesture to honor and preserve that culture for myself, for my family, and for others who appreciate these traditions, values, and foods.” As Linda’s mother Alice described it, “Dear, if you make it with love, it will be delicious.” Sallem dayetkoom!<br /><br />(A heartfelt shukran (thank you) to Linda for the review copy of Alice’s Kitchen, postcard featuring her original oil paintings, and copy of the January / February 1997 Aramco World magazine she was the cover story on.)",Positive
"Mornings have always been my favorite time of the day – sitting down enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee and a freshly baked treat as the sun streams across the kitchen table is the perfect way to start the day. I have and cherish both of Patty Pinner’s memoir cookbooks, [[ASIN:1580087981 Sweets: Soul Food Desserts and Memories]] and [[ASIN:1561588482 Sweety Pies: An Uncommon Collection of Womanish Observations, with Pie]], and was excited to see that she had a new cookbook coming out that focused on breakfast and brunch recipes. Patty, a fellow native of Michigan, collected wonderful soul food recipes and stories in her two previous cookbooks, and “Sweet Mornings” is no exception. Each of the 125 recipes is peppered with memories of friends, family and neighbors in Michigan, visiting family in Tennessee, and the larger-than-life personalities of the strong women that surrounded her: neighbors with flashy tastes in dresses, mink coats, and handbags who could turn out sumptuous feasts, others who gave sound advice to young wives, strong matriarchs who expressed their love through sugar and butter, and the world viewed through the more innocent lens of childhood.<br /><br />No matter your favorite breakfast vice (biscuits, quick breads, pancakes, muffins, bars, waffles, cinnamon rolls, French toast), all are amply represented in the 125 recipes. I loved that some fall into the quick and easy category (including a handful that use pie filling or pudding mix, such as the pistachio coffee cake and Ava Joy’s Lemon Streusel), while others like the orange-filled rolls are perfect for more leisurely mornings. Although most of the book is devoted to baked goods, you’ll also find more substantial brunch offerings including chicken and waffles, chicken salad, hash browns, steak and eggs.<br /><br />I inherited several recipes from my Polish grandmother, who was a talented baker; one of my favorites is her sour cream coffeecake, so I was thrilled to see nearly two dozen variations in “Sweet Mornings” ranging from the traditional (old-fashioned sour cream, which is closest to what my babcia made) to coffeecakes punched up with citrus (Lemon Drizzle and Ava Joy’s Lemon Streusel), chocolate, fruit-filled, and more. I tried the Mama’s Strawberry Coffee Cake first as strawberries are in season here in Japan; for this recipe, I used the smallest, sweetest strawberries I could find. Two cups of strawberries may sound like a lot – indeed, I had trouble chopping my strawberries into uniform pieces as they were so ripe, they fairly dissolved into puddles of juicy sweetness as I cut, but the final result is a layer of no-fuss strawberry jam. The layer of strawberries was a delightful variation and one I look forward to making frequently as it freezes well. One note about the recipe below is that I had to modify the instructions; the ingredient amounts for the butter in the batter and the topping are reversed (the instructions call for you to cream 2 Tbsp melted butter with the sugar, but from years of baking experience I knew to reverse the amounts and cream the one stick softened butter with the sugar, reserving the melted butter for the streusel topping).<br /><br />Mama’s Strawberry Coffee Cake (recipe adapted from “Sweet Mornings”)<br />(Makes 1 9-inch square coffee cake)<br />Batter:<br />Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing (I use Baker’s Joy)<br />1 ½ cups all-purpose flour<br />1 teaspoon baking powder<br />1 teaspoon baking soda<br />½ teaspoon salt<br />½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br />½ cup granulated sugar<br />1 large egg, room temperature<br />½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />½ cup half-and-half, room temperature<br />2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and chopped<br /><br />Topping:<br />½ cups all-purpose flour<br />½ cup granulated sugar<br />½ cup chopped walnuts<br />2 Tablespoons melted butter<br />½ teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with the cooking spray and set aside.<br />2. To make the batter: In a large mixing bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.<br />3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, break up the butter by mixing on low speed for 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 2 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent large lumps from forming. As the mixer is running, reduce the speed to low and add the egg, making sure that it is thoroughly incorporated into the mixture. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined. (Do not overbeat.) Turn off the mixer.<br />4. Set the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture and the half-and-half to the bowl of the mixer in alternating thirds, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Continue beating until the mixture is just moistened. (Do not overbeat).<br />5. To make the topping: in a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, walnuts, butter and cinnamon, and using your hands, stir until well blended (I found I needed a little extra melted butter to get the consistency I was looking for).<br />6. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish and arrange the strawberries evenly on top of the batter. Evenly sprinkle the topping on top of the strawberries. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool in the baking dish on a wire rack and allow to cool completely.<br />7. Turn out the cake, slice and transfer to a serving platter. Serve at room temperature.<br />The second coffee cake I tried was the Apricot Coffee Bread. I love all things dried apricot, and this coffee bread (really more of a pound cake) was no exception. Rich with butter and sour cream, the cake is studded with beautiful cubes of apricot and toasted pecans. Be sure to chop your apricots into small uniform pieces for best appearance. Again, I found I had to make a small adjustment to the recipe as it does not specify when to add the flour mixture to the batter; after adding the eggs and sour cream, you’re instructed to stir in apricots and pecans and bake. I decided to add the flour in three additions on low speed after incorporating the sour cream (which I had first mixed with vanilla bean paste), then stirred in the apricots and pecans by hand rather than mixer. The amount of streusel seems like a lot, but this is a large cake, so use the whole amount; I found I had to take the cake out a couple of times during baking to sprinkle more topping around the edges of the pan where plain batter was pushing up. The topping also browned quickly towards the last 20 minutes of baking, so I covered with foil to prevent it from overbrowning.<br />One consideration is that you are instructed to bake in a tube or Bundt pan, but the bread has a topping, meaning that you will have to invert the bread onto a plate, flip, and put right-side-up to cool to keep the topping crunchy (the bread is equally beautiful if you leave it topping-side-down like a traditional Bundt; that way, the apricots look like bits of stained glass). The instructions also call to dust with powdered sugar, so if you prefer to make it as a traditional Bundt, you can skip the topping and dust the finished bread with powdered sugar instead. As I collect Bundt pans (hence my moniker of “Bundt Lust&#34;), I used my 10-15 cup anniversary Bundt and this cake nearly came to the top, so use a sizeable pan.<br /><br />Apricot Coffee Bread (adapted from “Sweet Mornings”)<br />Makes 1 10-inch tube or Bundt bread<br />Topping:<br />½ cup all-purpose flour<br />½ cup firmly packed brown sugar<br />1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />4 tablespoons butter, cold, cut into small pieces<br /><br />Batter:<br />Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing<br />3 cups all-purpose flour<br />1 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br />½ teaspoon baking soda<br />½ teaspoon salt<br />¾ cup (1 ½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br />1 ½ cups granulated sugar<br />3 large eggs, room temperature (warm cold eggs by placing in a bowl of warm water)<br />1 cup sour cream, room temperature<br />1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />1 cup dried apricots, chopped into small pieces<br />½ cup chopped pecans (I toasted them first)<br />Confectioners’ sugar (for garnish)<br />1. To make the topping: In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon and stir until well combined. Using your fingers, a pastry blender, or the tines of a fork, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles small crumbs. Set aside.<br />2. Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 10-inch tube or Bundt pan with Baker’s Joy and set aside.<br />3. To make the batter: In a large mixing bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: the lour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.<br />4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, break up the butter by mixing on low speed for 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed or 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom owt the bowl to prevent lumps from forming. As the mixer is running, reduce the speed to low and slowly add the eggs, 1 at a time; after you add each egg, scrape down the sides of the bowl and resume eating on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the sour cream and anilla extract (I used vanilla bean paste) and beat at low speed for 30 seconds. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract and beat at low speed for 2 to 3 seconds, until just incorporated.<br />5. Add the flour mixture in three batches, mixing on low just until incorporated. Turn off the mixer.<br />6. Add the apricots and pecans to the batter and stir just until distributed.<br />7. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and evenly sprinkle the top of the batter with the topping. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool on a wire rack.<br />8. Using a silicone spatula, separate the bread from the pan and invert onto the wire rack to cool completely (I let mine cool in the pan; if you decide to turn it out, put a piece of foil under the rack to catch any topping that falls off).<br />9. Transfer to a serving platter and dust with the confectioners’’ sugar. Slice and sere at room temperature.<br />Other recipes that reminded me of my grandmother’s European baked goods included Aunt Zaida’s Almond Coffee Ring and old-fashioned rice pudding squares, a breakfast staple in my house. My grandma used to make a superb nutmeg-topped rice pudding that I later added dried cherries to in place of raisins and as an adult, I use Arborio rice, which Patty also recommends. These familiar dishes transported me back to my childhood when I used to “bake” (read: taste!) alongside my grandmother in her small Michigan kitchen.<br /><br />Next, I made a half recipe of the cherry granola. Growing up in Michigan, I love all things cherry; Patty’s granola is a festive combination of cherries, pecans, coconut, cinnamon, nutmeg and tart cherries. I substituted maple sugar for the brown sugar as I love maple (the recipe also calls for ¼ cup maple syrup). It’s the perfect way to start your morning off with a pop of color when you don’t have the time or energy for a “fancy” breakfast involving lots of cooking. Be sure to keep a close eye on your granola as it bakes as the nuts and coconut are prone to turn from toasted to burned very quickly! There is no comparison between store-bought granola and homemade; I love that you can customize it with nuts and fruits you like, as well as monitor the oil and sugar content (not so with storebought). Kept in an airtight container, it keeps very well and also makes a beautiful gift when packaged in a decorative jar!<br /><br />Verdict: this is a must-have for all bakers; there is enough variety to keep you happily baking for ages and you’re sure to find new ideas to update classic treats, classic soul food (fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles), and “Sweet Mornings” is just as valuable for the many wonderful stories and larger-than-life characters that bring the recipes to vibrant life (baking along to classic 1960s Motown and soul optional but highly recommended!).<br /><br />Thank you to Agate for the review copy and permission to reprint recipes!<br /><br />(This review originally published on Bundt Lust 22 April, 2016)",Positive
"I was vaguely familiar with Sara Moulton from her show on PBS (I'd watched several episodes where she cooked with other chefs I follow, such as Michele Scicolone ([[ASIN:0547744455 The Mediterranean Slow Cooker]]) and Grace Young, but had never cooked from one of her cookbooks before, so I was excited to try out &#34;Home Cooking 101.&#34; A fantastic illustrated guide to pantry staples and step-by-step prep for more complicated dishes, you'll learn essential techniques such as making your own stock, preserved lemon slices, ricotta and paneer, how to bake fish in a parchment bag, how to French a rack of lamb, pounding cutlets and more. Helpful sidebars give additional info and tips and tricks, including herb pairings, how to prepare ingredients, ingredient primers, etc. The numbered step-by-step photos (which get an entire page) are tremendously helpful to learn new techniques such as making spaetzle, crack a coconut, pound cutlets, trimming a rack of lamb, etc.<br /><br />The book includes chapters on soups and salads, meat, poultry, seafood and vegetarian/vegan entrees, side dishes, “quick and quicker” entrees, more labor-intensive dishes for &#34;when you have time,&#34; and desserts (&#34;something sweet&#34;). One thing that took getting used to was the fact that chapter headers do not have tables of contents, so you will have to refer to the index or bookmark using sticky tabs to quickly locate recipes.<br /><br />As I have several years’ experience in publishing (including layout in InDesign), I tend to pay close attention to a book’s layout, and the simple, uncluttered layout here (and effective use of color and fonts; recipe titles and ingredients are listed in teal, while steps are in black) works wonderfully. The font size and spacing make this highly readable even from a cookbook holder; all too often, I’ve reviewed books with too-light print or gloss pages that render them unreadable under actual kitchen conditions.<br /><br />For my first test recipe, I decided to try the salmon baked in a bag. Although I’ve long known of the technique, I’d never tried making it at home; a pity, because know that I know how easy it is, I will certainly be cooking this way more often! You layer thin slices of orange and lemon, sprinkle with rosemary, top with seasoned salmon filets, top with more lemon and orange slices and chopped olives (I used Kalamata since the recommended oil-cured are impossible to find here) and bake; I halved the recipe for two good-sized filets, and it took about 14 minutes. The bonus is that your kitchen doesn’t smell “fishy,” and the fish cooks up perfectly moist, marinated in the citrus juices and a drizzle of olive oil. You could also switch out the orange slices for blood orange and use Meyer lemons; the possibilities are endless! Cleanup is a breeze; simply open the parchment bag, use a spatula to transfer the fish and citrus to a serving platter, and toss the parchment, no mess or pans to clean.<br /><br />I love the broad range of international influences that abound, from Thai-style chicken salad and Korean BBQ Tofu Tacos to Thai-flavored pumpkin custard, Goan shrimp curry, Japanese (baked eggplant with miso-ginger glaze), French cuisine (duck breasts with warm lentil salad, duck confit, vichyssoise), Latin dishes, and more.<br /><br />As a longtime vegetarian (now pescetarian, although I eat a vegetarian / vegan diet 90% of the time), I really appreciated a whole chapter devoted to vegetarian and vegan entrees; all too often, vegetarian mains are an afterthought, but here we have Indian eggs with spicy tomato pepper sauce, zucchini patties with garlicky yogurt sauce, spicy greens ravioli, Korean vegetable pancakes, stir-fried tofu, saag paneer, and Korean BBQ tofu tacos to tempt even the most hardened carnivore.<br /><br />Recipes from guest chefs include many familiar names such as Joanne Chang (Flour, Boston), Hiroko Shimbo, Jacques Torres, Marc Vetri, and stir-fry guru Grace Young. The book is rounded out with online and mail order sources, a handy seasonal produce guide, and metric equivalents.<br /><br />The one negative is that the book is not bound well; my copy has already split at the seams despite careful handling, and the cardboard cover seems to be on the flimsy side given the book’s weight and bends easily.<br /><br />Otherwise, I look forward to trying many more recipes from Home Cooking 101 in the weeks and months to come!",Positive
"I previously reviewed Dahlia Abraham-Klein’s [[ASIN:0804843376 Silk Road Vegetarian: Vegan, Vegetarian and Gluten Free Recipes for the Mindful Cook [Vegetarian Cookbook, 101 Recipes]]] for Amazon, and loved the blend of Middle Eastern and Central Asian flavors; low-fat and full of flavor, there are also many gluten-free and dairy-free recipes (including baked goods). In her latest book Spiritual Kneading, Dahlia combines meditation and reflection with the traditionally feminine task of making, blessing, and baking the challah, a bread with deep spiritual and cultural meaning central to Jewish life.<br /><br />Spiritual Kneading uses the medium of meditation while kneading and working the dough to reflect on various passages and themes for each Jewish month. Beginning with an introduction to the feminine dimension of Rosh Chodesh and challah, there is a fascinating look at the origins of separating challah in midrashic verse. There are instructions how to form a Rosh Chodesh Challah Baking Group (“Spiritual Kneaders”), with a curriculum for each month of study and a helpful planner including an outline, equipment, and calendar. Further reading suggestions are also included to extend the use of the book beyond the first year. Numerous prayers in Hebrew (some transliterated) and English are included. Each month’s syllabus contains a specific challah recipe and shape that mirrors that month’s theme. Each recipe includes an introduction to the challah theme during the yeast activation, meditation during kneading, and a discussion during the rising, as well as reflective questions.<br /><br />Although I’ve been baking challah for years, I learned so many fascinating historical facts, customs and the use of challah across the centuries through Spiritual Kneading; baking challah is truly forging a connection across time. The significance of each ingredient took on new meaning as I continued to read and bake. I also love that Dahlia recommends using organic, fair-trade ingredients when baking; this is something I try to practice every day.<br /><br />Beginning with Tishrei, the first month of the year, there is a traditional spiral challah with apple and silan (date syrup, the original “honey” mentioned in the Torah/Bible). Rosh Hashanah traditionally has us dip apples in honey for a sweet year, and spiral challahs are traditional as well, representing positive changes in the new year (others believe it represents a crown. Other loaves include a (dairy) braided cheese loaf for Kislev (there is also a pareve option), Seven Species pomegranate-shaped challah for Shvat, boiled egg in challah (chubzeh di Purim) for Adar Alef, a gorgeous rose-shaped challah with raisins and rosewater for Adar Bet, and a crown-shaped challah with olive oil and za’atar for Elul. The basic dough recipe for each is the same, and is scaled to make 8-10 medium loaves (as I am baking for a small household, I scaled each recipe to 1/4, which yields two medium loaves).<br /><br />I’ve been baking challah for years, but was intrigued by the book’s premise of merging meditation (which I practice frequently) with bread baking; I had always found the rhythm of kneading to be soothing, and it lends itself well as a time for reflection. I made the rose-shaped challah with raisins and rosewater using the crown-shaped braiding instructions, and I can say without a doubt that this is truly the most beautiful loaf of challah I’ve ever made. I used premium yeast from my friends at Red Star Yeast, who were kind enough to send samples, as well as imported Lebanese rosewater from Maureen Abood’s online market.<br /><br />The basic dough recipe is a water challah (no eggs or butter) with a little olive oil added:<br />Basic dough recipe:<br />4 tablespoons active dry yeast<br />4 ½ cups (1.1L) warm water<br />¾ cup (150g) organic sugar plus 2 tablespoons organic sugar<br />5 pounds (2.25 kg) organic white flour<br />1 ½ tablespoons sea salt<br />1 cup (230 ml) neutral-tasting oil (some recipes call for olive oil)<br /><br />This dough is more common with Sephardic Jews rather than the perhaps more familiar “eggy” challah baked by Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe; Sephardic Jews believe that adding eggs to the dough renders the challah more like cake, and thus ineligible for the Hamotzi blessing.<br /><br />The basic dough recipe very easy to work with and produces a light, fluffy, sweet challah (the base recipe calls for added sugar) that invites add-ins. As I primarily cook in metric, I appreciated that metric weights were included for portions of each recipe. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow (and the step-by-step photos were a lifesafer, especially for my first attempt at braiding a four-strand crown loaf!).  The cooking times were also very accurate; the recipe mentioned 30-35 minutes, and mine took 30 exactly (my old oven tended to run hot, so breads baked faster / more unevenly).<br /><br />I love that the author also includes a challah recipe using fresh yeast; one of my earliest memories in the kitchen is of my Polish grandmother baking bread with fresh yeast, and it’s a tradition I’ve tried to uphold (I generally purchase fresh yeast from bakeries as the Fleishman brand once found in the grocery store seems to be a relic of the past due to its rapid spoilage). Recipes for spelt, whole wheat, and a gluten-free oat challah (which requires shaping in a silicone mold as it is not braidable) are also included. Other shapes and braids (single strand, two-strand, four-strand, six-strand) are also included, with super-helpful step-by-step photos for the braiding.<br /><br />Not only are the bread recipes delicious, creative, and reliable, but I really connected with Dahlia’s choice of reflections for each bread. Many stories from the Torah are brought to life with details I’d never noticed before, and the choice of readings and reflective questions really bring a deeper spirituality to making challah. I look forward to baking my way through the rest of the book over the coming year!<br />Anyone interested in bread baking  should add this title to your collection; the step-by-step photos and helpful text demystify yeast baking for all audiences.<br /><br />(This review originally published on Bundt Lust April 13, 2016)",Positive
"As a huge fan of Sarina's Sepharic Cuisine blog and app, I was thrilled to hear that she was publishing her first standalone cookbook, &#34;Backyard Kitchen: Mediterranean Salads.&#34; Published in the New York Times, NT Times Jewish Cookbook, and Joan Nathan's [[ASIN:0375402764 Jewish Cooking in America: Expanded Edition (Knopf Cooks American)]], Mr. Roffe's book includes many recipes handed down from mother to daughter with love and are traditional foods found in the Levant. Her grandmother, Ester Cohen Salem, immigrated to America through Beiruit and was the first to own a Syrian Jewish catering service Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Her backyard kitchen became the center of life for the entire Syrian community in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Salads are common throughout the Middle East, although certain salads are only found among Sephardic families, such as Syrian-style potato salad and avocado salad. Many of these salads feature olive oil and lemon juice in dressings, but do not use lettuce as the Middle East is an arid region and water is at a premium.<br /><br />As I am vegetarian, I LOVED the range of healthful salads here, including Sephardi-style beets with tamarind paste, fava bean salad with hard-boiled eggs, babaghanouj, fruited couscous (apple Craisin, cranapple carrot, seven species) and homemade pickles, another staple at Mediterranean and Middle Eastern tables (cauliflower, turnips, mushrooms). Other than tamarind paste and pomegranate molasses (both of which I always keep in my fridge!), the recipes use everyday ingredients. All recipes are labeled as parve or dairy. Other than one or two recipes that call for salmon and tuna, all are suitable for vegetarians. Certain recipes also feature video demonstrations on Sarina's website. Handy notes also point out the origins and health benefits of each dish, along with suggested pairings.<br /><br />This is a lovely addition to your cookbook library that is perfect for summer; these salads are light and refreshing (unlike many American-style picnic salads and coleslaws), chock full of colorful veggies and fruits, and the perfect way to use up summer's bounty.",Positive
"Hot Bread Kitchen, based in NYC, builds lasting economic security for low-income, immigrant and minority individuals by creating pathways to professional opportunities in the culinary industry. 67% of their operating budget is funded through the sale of multi-ethnic breads and rental of commercial kitchen space. The range of breads that they bake and deliver includes Iran (nan-e-barbari, a chewy flatbread topped with black and white sesame seeds, and nan-e-qandi), Morocco (m'smen, a flaky flatbread traditionally served for breakfast with honey), Mexico (corn tortillas), Eastern Europe (challah), Ethiopia (the slightly sour injera, fermented teff flour served with wat), and more.​<br /><br /> The long-awaited Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook is divided by bread type: unleavened and flatbreads, lean breads and rolls, enriched breads, rolls, and buns, filled doughs, and quick breads and holiday breads. You'll find favorites from India (paratha, naan, chapatis), the Middle East (hummus, pita), Eastern Europe (challah, matzo, eier kichel, bialys, knishes, kreplach, nut roll), France / Italy (batard, pan bagnat, olive boules, ciabatta) and Mexico / Latin America (pan de muertos, conchas, tortillas, guacamole, tamales, tostadas, empanadas). Other little-known gems include Albanian cheese triangles, Tibetan momos, Another thing I liked was that various recipes are included that use leftover bread, from bread puddings and stale bread (panzanella, tres leches bread pudding with Mexican chocolate sauce, ribollita), to complementary dishes (curry, wat, stews, dips, salads) that pair perfectly with the included bread recipes.<br /><br />I consider myself a fairly competent home baker; I have long worked with yeast breads (including fresh cake yeast) both kneading by hand and stand mixer, and I welcomed the challenge of new bread types. Step-by-step photos (for trickier items like braiding challah) are particularly helpful for novice bakers. As a longtime baker of challah, I particularly appreciated the many challah recipes, including basic, raisin, whole wheat and Sephardic. You'll even find Vietnamese-style bagueettes and iced Vietnamese coffee.<br /><br /> This lovely selection of breads and accompanying dishes, sauces, and sides is rounded out by baker profiles and a very thorough guide to tips, equipment, and bread storage suggestions. Ingredients are given in US volume and metric (for my baking books, I generally prefer weight measurements, so appreciated having the metric weights given). Gorgeous photos give serving suggestions for each bread and side dish featured in the book. A list of online/mail-order sources and a hefty list of acknowledgments round out the book.<br /><br />An excellent resource for home bakers, especially if you already have some prior bread baking experience. This is a fantastic treasure trove if you enjoy trying international bread recipes and new dishes; it would be fun to host themed dinners using the included recipes. Highly recommended!<br /><br />(I received this book through Blogging For Books)",Positive
"I am a huge fan of Israeli cuisine and have read numerous cookbooks in the last several years focusing on this diverse cuisine, so I was excited to be offered &#34;Modern Israeli Cooking&#34; by Danielle Oron, the creative force behind Moo Milk Bar and the blog &#34;I Will Not East Oysters.&#34; Danielle's family moved from Tel Aviv to New Jersey when she was a toddler, and her family was known as &#34;those crazy Israelis.&#34; In her words, these recipes combine her culinary background in French technique with classic Israeli flavors to create new and modern dishes.<br /><br />Modern Israel is a melting pot; you'll find cuisine from Morocco, Eastern Europe, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey. Dishes are served family-style with a lot of side plates consisting of salads and dips; this is my personal culinary heaven. The recipes are divided into weekdays (chicken shawarma rice bowl, kofta kebab freekeh salad, za'atar chicken, pashtida), Fridays (challah, ricotta and za'atar ravioli, lemon chicken with olives, harissa lamb meatballs), beach (peel and eat harissa shrimp - if you haven't guessed already, this is NOT a kosher cookbook), salmon ceviche, chermoula fish tacos, seared sesame tuna), slow cooking (braised pomegranate short ribs, roasted garli and apricot chicken, hawaij oxtail ragu, pastrami), brunch (shakshuka, bourekas, babka French toast, za'atar sesame mini bagels), midnight (za'atar fried eggs, feta grilld cheese, cinnamon challah), salads and sides (tabbouleh, carrots several ways, pickled beets), sweets (saled tahini chocolate chip cookies, tahini-swirled brownies, halva morning buns, honey and apple cake), and stapes (tahini, ancho chili harissa, labne, schug, preserved lemons, dukkah). Ingredients are given in US (volume) and metric.<br /><br />Danielle's commentary is on the hip side; recipe subtitles frequently involve food puns and cultural insights, like the mild red pepper harissa: &#34;If you like the flavor, but you have a death wish / enjoy S&M, add more of the Thai chilis and a bit more hot paprika.&#34;) or tahini: &#34;We put this sh*t on everything.&#34;<br /><br />True to the book's goal, you will find classic flavors with modern twists; the beloved sabich has been turned into a breakfast bowl with shredded potato hash, falafel gets some help from spinach and is served with green tahini and sauerkraut, you'll find Sephardic pastries like bourekas supersized and dressed up with mushrooms and caramelized onions, Milky has been reinvented as a decadent, boozy pot de creme. I loved the peppered watermelon and feta, as watermelon + mint + Bulgarian feta is a staple breakfast in my house; here, Korean red pepper flakes and black pepper kick this up a notch.<br /><br />Overall this is a fun, young take on modern Israeli cooking - you'll find many familiar flavor profiles (za'atar, tahini, sumac, schug, dukkah) and plenty of colorful veggie salads and sides to dress up your table. From a comfort food perspective, it contains the most amazing grilled cheese recipe (feta grilled with Kalamata olives - heaven!), eggs and sumac soldiers, and many warming dishes that would be great for cooler nights (braised pomegranate short ribs, sweet shredded honey lamb, beer-braised holiday brisket, homemade pastrami).<br />*For those who keep kosher, please note that this is NOT a kosher cookbook - it contains shellfish recipes as well as meat mixed with dairy. However, most of the recipes are (or can be made) kosher with a little tweaking.",Positive
"This is the perfect jumping-off point if you’re new to cooking and baking with yogurt and are looking for more ways to incorporate it into your diet; I frequently eat yogurt at least twice a day and use it in a variety of dishes as a marinade, in baking, etc., and really appreciated the quick, easy ideas in “Yogurt,” particularly the Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian accents.<br /><br />Far beyond simple parfaits or yogurt-based dips such as tzatziki, yogurt can be used as the base for a number of versatile appetizers, soups, salads, main dishes (particularly as a marinade for meats), and desserts. In “Yogurt,” Janet Fletcher (longtime contributor to the San Francisco Chronicle and author of the Planet Cheese newsletter) collects a wide range of tantalizing recipes using yogurt, from breakfast parfaits to more unusual applications such as Seared Mushrooms & Shallots in Yogurt with Garam Masala, Harissa-Roasted Chicken with Sweet Peppers, Cucumber Salad with Yogurt, Golden Raisins, Walnuts & Mint, and Indian Yogurt Pudding with Saffron, Cardamom & Toasted Nuts (Shrikhand).<br /><br />You’ll find advice on making your own yogurt as well as selecting store-bought (as well as when it is acceptable to substitute lower-fat yogurt in a recipe), a great guide to seasonal fruit for breakfast parfaits, yogurt with eggs, and other add-ins. Many of these are suggestions more than recipes per se. Note that the book only refers to dairy-based yogurts; you won’t find suggestions or mentions of soy- or alternative non-dairy yogurts (hemp, coconut, rice, etc.).<br /><br />I loved the appetizers section in particular, as Greek and Turkish mezze are some of my favorite foods on earth (and also vegetarian-friendly!). Recipes like Yogurt Cheese with Feta, Pumpkin Seeds and Za’atar, Grated Beet and Yogurt Salad with Beet Greens, and Chopped Summer Vegetable Salad with Farro, Yogurt and Za’atar make perfect summer meals when it’s too hot to cook. Meat dishes feature many Mediterranean-inspired lamb and yogurt dishes (including a recipe for homemade skillet flatbread for souvlaki), while veggie dishes offer a blend of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors. I also loved the Fettuccine with Fried Onions, Yogurt and Poppy Seeds, and the light, fruit-based desserts like panna cotta, Warm Baked Figs with Pernod, Candied Walnuts and Yogurt, and Yogurt Mousse with Orange Marmalade and Toasted Almonds. Along the way, gorgeous photographs will inspire you to make many (if not all!) of the dishes in this book. You’ll also find a selection of yogurt-based drinks such as Indian lassi, smoothies, and ayran. Finally, a fairly thorough bibliography and list of mail order / online resources for supplies will give you plenty of tools to embark on your own yogurt journey.<br /><br />*I received this book through Blogging for Books",Positive
"I’ll admit to not being familiar with Tara O’Brady’s blog “Seven Spoons” before being offered the chance to review the cookbook, but I will most certainly be following her in the future. Beginning with a very nice overview (with specific brands) for common seasonings (including my favorite secret weapon gojuchang!), flavoring agents, and measurements, “Seven Spoons” contains a versatile arsenal of recipes that really appealed to me. As I love breakfast any time of day, the breakfast chapter in particular was particularly tempting, with such gems as fig and ginger granola, bostocks, a savory steel-cut oatmeal, chocolate olive oil zucchini bread, and vanilla espresso walnut butter starting (or ending!) to start your day right.<br /><br />Main dishes include a variety of chicken, seafood (including an unctuous slow-baked salmon with butter beans), and beef. Many of the recipes are vegetarian-friendly as well, including fattoush with fava and labneh, hummus with white miso, mushrooms and greens with toast, olive and orange cauliflower, the North Indian baked eggs that are reminiscent of Israeli breakfast staple shakshouka, and a notable section of desserts and pantry staples. I have dozens of baking and dessert cookbooks, and really loved some of Tara’s simple yet elegant recipes like fig toasts with buttered honey, blood orange stout cake, Vietnamese coffee ice cream, and roasted grapes with sweet labneh. The staples section includes guidance on making numerous dairy products at home (cultured and flavored butters, crème fraiche, ricotta, yogurt, and dressings). The compound butter section was excellent, including some suggestions I had not seen in my many other cookbooks (as the author is Canadian, I appreciated the addition of maple butter). The maple, tapenade, and sweet fennel pollen butters will be starring in regular rotation in my kitchen,<br /><br />Recipes are generally quite simple (which makes them perfect for novice cooks), with ingredients given in Imperial volume and metric measurements. There’s a distinctive Indian and Middle Eastern flair running throughout, from veggie pakoras and homemade naan to za’atar chicken, halloumi with chermoula, roasted carrots with harissa aioli and dukkah, and a lentil kofta curry.<br /><br />Along the way, recipes are rounded out with gorgeous photography (for those who prefer their cookbooks to be photo-heavy, note that not every recipe has a photo). I loved the tone of each recipe foreword, and the excellent section on pantry staples. This is a book that is both appealing and practical, with most ingredients readily available at my supermarket and many recipes that can be put together fairly quickly, meaning that it will see regular rotation in my kitchen! Highly recommended.<br /><br />(I received this book through Blogging for Books)",Positive
"Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls, cookies, breads and cheesecake and reinvents them, using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction, the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor, muffled complexity, and concealed true richness,” so her goal was to create delicious, healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.<br /><br />Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings), including peppercorn and chile, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and cardamom, ginger, and savory herbs and spices. Along the way, Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style, along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.<br /><br />Cinnamon, hazelnut and date buns, ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam, orange and honey baklava, orange-clove pull-apart bread, and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago, I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee), so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!<br /><br />Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on; there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results, particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.<br /><br />In addition to familiar treats, you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles, clafoutis and tarte tatin, Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread, Thai banana fritters, Indonesian kue lapis, Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall, and other fragrant, delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker, I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!<br /><br />(I received my copy through Blogging for Books)",Positive
"Earlier this summer, I ordered the excellent &#34;[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general, especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form, this is an excellent, informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted, stir-fried, curry), dals, grains (pilaf, flattened rice, upmas), breads and pancakes, numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes, chutneys, and drinks, sweets and desserts. From what I can tell, &#34;Vegetarian India&#34; appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements, so if you already own &#34;Curry Easy Vegetarian,&#34; you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely, user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine; highly recommended.",Positive
"Out of the 20+ Japanese cookbooks I own (including the excellent [[ASIN:1449418295 Japanese Farm Food]] and [[ASIN:1580085199 Washoku: Recipes from the Japanese Home Kitchen]]), this is truly one of the most helpful due to the step-by-step photos and clear explanations. I like that the Japanese names of the dishes are also included (and the meaning  / origins) explained. The technique section is worth the cost of the book alone! You will find an overview of the aesthetics behind Japanese washoku cuisine, kitchen tools, ingredients, traditional table settings and etiquette.<br /><br />Chihiro Masui and Hanae Kaede have done a wonderful job at making Japanese cuisine accessible to the (American) masses. I loved that the authors also differentiated between traditional Japanese cuisine and influence from foreign cuisine. Recipes are divided into six sections (starters, bowls and soups, vegetables and tofu, fried and grilled, rice and noodles, and sweets). Suggestions for readily available substitutions are also provided.<br /><br />For several years, I have tried to master the art of rolling Japanese-style omelettes. I even brought home a gorgeous Japanese iron omelette pan from Japan with no luck, but thanks to the clear step-by-step photos, I finally feel like I'm one step closer to mastering the proper technique to make beautiful rolled omelettes. There are so many fascinating tidbits and tips that have helped me to better understand Japanese food (I took four cooking classes around Japan when I was working there previously in 2011), and I feel that I am a better / more confident home cook for it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone new to Japanese cuisine; the step-by-step photos are truly helpful in understanding the basic preparation of common dishes such as chawanmushi, tamagoyaki, steamed dishes, wagashi, etc.",Positive
"I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon; I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker,” which introduced me to the joys of making flan, cheesecake, and fruit compote in the slow cooker.<br /><br />Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire, so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors, food consultants, cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog, www.pluggedintocooking.com.<br /><br />As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived, I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes, but also bread puddings, fruits, and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers, bakeware, and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward, and each recipe is followed by helpful tips, making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers, and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker, but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also, perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used, but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick, but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy, but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.<br /><br />The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly, so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly; I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust, spiced pumpkin filling, praline topping), this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney; this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up, so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe, so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe, and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer; the recipe says that it should be thin, but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt, as an accompaniment to Indian food, or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed, but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews, semisweet and milk chocolate chips, a dark chocolate candy bar, and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).<br /><br />Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce, rice pudding with cherries, and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk, German chocolate, ginger-peach, coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake, Southern sweet potato cake, pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.<br /><br />(Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!)",Positive
"Lesley Stowe, the creator of one of my favorite snacks Raincoast Crisps, is also a Paris-trained chef who has published several successful cookbooks as well as sharing her tips for cooking and entertaining on shows like Entertainment Tonight Canada and CTV Morning Live. After returning to Vancouver from cooking school in Paris, she noticed that there was a distinct lack of elegant, sophisticated desserts like those found in France and opened a catering business. Her first cookbook, “The Lesley Stowe Fine Foods Cookbook,” was published in 2006, but she had longed to do a cookbook just about desserts.<br /><br />Enter 2014’s “Desserts From My Kitchen.” In addition to all of Lesley’s favorite creations, you’ll also find For Best Results pointers as well as instructional videos on Lesley’s YouTube channel. “Desserts From My Kitchen” is divided into nine chapters including baking basics to cookies, bars, tarts, cakes, dinner party desserts, frozen desserts and holiday favorites. Beginning with the cookies, I loved some of the unusual pairings such as the lime pecan thins, apricot ginger cookies, lemon clove cookies, and winterfruit drops. The stellar and bars deserve special mention, from the caramelly Carmelita bars and very Canadian butter tart bars to the chocolate pecan rum, chocolate, caramel and espresso, apricot almond with white chocolate, and hazelnut anise biscotti.<br /><br />Tarts include French classics such as the tarte tatin to a tropical toasted macadamia coconut tart, papaya passion fruit tart, decadent bittersweet chocolate tart and caramel nut crunch tart with chocolate truffle pastry. Several of the showstopping cakes are also gluten-free (Cracker Queen’s chocolate macadamia nut cake, chocolate date pecan cake with bourbon cr&egrave;me anglaise, Beijing chocolate spice cake). I made the Beijing chocolate spice cake and loved the complex notes from the Chinese five-spice powder (a suggested variation includes cinnamon and chipotle for a Mexican flair); using whole star anise as a garnish makes for a gorgeous presentation. I also appreciated tips for freezing and refreshing cakes as oftentimes I don’t have the time to make a dessert right before the event.<br /><br />The chapter on dinner party desserts will give you a wide range of cobblers, crumbles, puddings, panna cottas and pots de cr&egrave;me to choose from. The semifreddos and frozen desserts offered many fantastic base recipes to experiment with; as a ginger fanatic, I loved the candied ginger and macadamia nut semifreddo, and the chocolate and Gosling’s rum semifreddo. Holiday favorites include festive finales such as drinks (Mexican hot chocolate, chai), cookies (shortbread, rugelach), cheesecakes, tarts, and cakes (yule log, chocolate chestnut torte, fruitcake) that are sure wow guests.<br /><br />Recipes are given in American and metric measurements (American measurements on the left, metric to the right), and I loved that some of the recipes have instructional videos on YouTube on Lesley’s channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCleB4fdPrk_NEjTN9tnIF2Q). Along the way, you’ll learn many French classics such as clafoutis, choux puffs, tarte tatin, a lovely silky lemon curd, ganache and praline. Other basic recipes include cream cheese and chocolate truffle press pastry, sweet tart dough, and almond paste.<br /><br />I found Lesley’s instructions to be straightforward and approachable and appreciated the many tips and optional step-by-step instructional videos on YouTube, which is great for mastering new techniques. I also loved the layout of the recipes (and the inclusion of both metric and American measurements). The end result is restaurant-worthy desserts that combine French techniques, international influence, and nods to comfort baking.<br />“Desserts From My Kitchen” has given me many creative, delicious ways to inspire my baking; with cues from French pastry and technique combined with tropical and nostalgic flavors, it’s a book that is approachable by home bakers (the YouTube videos are particularly helpful for those new to baking) and the desserts will leave a lasting impression on your guests!<br /><br />(Thank you to Lesley and publicist for my review copy!)",Positive
"“Clean Slate” (from the editors of Martha Stewart Living) is part guide, part cookbook that emphasizes eating clean, whole, unprocessed foods (mostly plant-based), including detox juices and two different “action plans” (a 3-day “jump start” plan and a three-week detox diet). The first 70 pages or so include 11 golden rules, from “practice mindful eating” (Golden Rule No. 3) to “maintain a healthy perspective” (Golden Rule No. 11).<br /><br />Along the way, you’ll learn about good fats (avocado, cold-water fish, nuts), umami-rich flavor enhancers (which lean strongly towards Asian flavors such as miso, nori, and fish sauce), detoxifiers and inflammation fighters, and tips and tricks on incorporating more physical activity, smart shopping, and finding inner balance. The included sample menus are color-coded to show vegan, dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free recipes at a glance, but my only concern with the sample menus is that the calorie count seems extremely low (each meal only features one recipe and no sides). Basic recipes for stock, harissa, almond milk, etc. are included in the back.<br /><br />The recipes feature simple prep and relatively few ingredients, making them easy to assemble and enjoy. I loved the breakfast options like coconut breakfast pudding with saut&eacute;ed nectarines, honey-caramelized figs with yogurt, crostini with fresh ricotta, cherries, and lemon zest, and breakfast vegetable-miso soup with chickpeas. A large variety of juices and smoothies are also included, along with their respective properties (anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, energizing, hydrating, etc.). There’s a very strong Asian influence with the dashi-poached sweet potatoes and greens ad buckwheat noodles, bok choy, and sweet potatoes and miso-lime broth and the black sea bass with barley, shiitake, and edamame salad, as well as some Middle-Eastern inspired gems like bulgur with pomegranate seeds, a North African chicken-chickpea stew, and Moroccan steamed salmon with quinoa and carrots. There are also Latin- and Mediterranean-inspired dishes, so every member of your family should find something to enjoy.<br /><br />Easy, healthy snacks such as trail mix, roasted edamame with cranberries, sweet potato chips, kale chips, and dried fruit and nut bites are great for school lunches or quick snacks on the go. Several lighter desserts and drinks are also included. Each recipe includes calories, fat, cholesterol, carbs, protein and fiber, although the print is a bit small and it doesn’t jump out at first glance. A thorough color-coded recipe index allows you to quickly plan a menu around dietary needs or plan out weekly menus. There are full-color, full-page photographs for nearly every recipe.<br /><br />Nearly all of the included recipes appealed to me (I frequently cook light Japanese-inspired fish and rice dishes), and I loved the whole grain recipes in particular as I am always looking for ways to jazz up whole grains (the farro and roasted sweet potato salad and quinoa salad with zucchini, mint and pistachios were standouts). Pescetarians will find many great fish dishes, and vegetarians will enjoy the many roasted vegetable salads and variations, although there are few vegan main-course dishes. I found this more valuable for the recipes than the “detox” sample menus, but your mileage may vary. Overall, “Clean Slate” offered many fantastic new recipes to add to my repertoire.<br /><br />(I received this book through Blogging for Books)",Positive
"Like many Greeks, Aglaia Kremezi grew up eating mostly vegetarian food: foraged greens, garden vegetables, beans of all kinds, fruity olive oil, and local cheeses and yogurt. Until recently, this was a typical Greek diet; meat was traditionally a rare and expensive commodity reserved for Sundays and holidays (daily meat consumption is still a relatively new phenomenon in Greece) and thus Greeks were mainly vegetarians out of necessity.<br /><br />Kremezi owns a cooking school in Greece called Kea Artisanal, and is the author of the popular “The Foods of Greece” and “Mediterranean Hot and Spicy.” Her newest cookbook “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” contains 150 simple, yet abundantly flavorful, plant-based seasonal dishes from Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, France, and Italy. Sample seasonal menu suggestions offer a wide range of options, including several buffet spreads and one-pot family meals. Recipes are conveniently labeled as vegan and/or gluten-free when applicable, and ingredients are given in American and metric measurements. There is a comprehensive list of online and mail order sources to ensure that you have the necessary ingredients on hand. In the spirit of Mediterranean cuisine, “use only what is freshest and in season;” Kremezi suggests that you “go to your local farmers’ market without a recipe or shopping list in hand, choose the seasonal produce that inspires you, and only then search the pages that follow for a recipe that will showcase your fresh ingredients.”<br /><br />The book begins with a chapter on basic preparations and techniques. Here you will find an arsenal of herbs, seasonings, pickles and preserves that will allow you to quickly transform a dish. You’ll also find an excellent guide to preparing and storing various types of leafy greens. Meze are the star of the show, including dips and spreads, salads, and baked and fried vegetables. If you are planning an all-meze meal (my favorite kind!), start with spreads, pickles, and cold vegetable dishes, then finish with the warm plates. Kremezi suggests serving meze with ouzo or white or rosé wines.<br /><br />In addition to Greek dishes, you’re just as likely to come across a Tunisian dish as a Balkan, Sicilian or Turkish one. Some of my favorite discoveries were the quince stuffed with wheat berries, nuts, and raisins, zucchini rolls stuffed with halloumi, and flatbread with dried figs, Roquefort cheese, and rosemary. The section on breads is excellent, including a homemade version of tortas de aceite as well as a pumpkin, tangerine, and marmalade bread. Desserts include a custardy orange and crumbled phyllo cake, rustic chocolates with dried figs, pistachios and toasted nuts and a quince spoon sweet (I loved the spicy variation infused with ginger, allspice and cayenne).<br /><br />Along the way, Kremezi imparts many fascinating stories into the origins of ingredients and techniques common to Mediterranean cuisines, and the stunning photography by Penny De Los Santos captures fresh produce, ingredients and dishes in a series of vibrant still lifes. The diverse Mediterranean vegetarian (and vegan) dishes featured within are sure to delight even the pickiest eater or devout carnivore. Sadly, all too often vegetarian main courses seem like an afterthought, but the recipes showcased in “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” are certain to become instant classics and bring vegetables and whole grains back into the spotlight where they belong.<br /><br />Whether you are already vegetarian or are simply interested in the Mediterranean diet and eating more healthfully, “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” deserves a place of honor in your cookbook collection.<br /><br />(This review was originally published for Mediterranean Living)",Positive
"Julian Armstrong has written about food for the Montreal Gazette for more than five decades. As soon as I heard about this book, I knew it was the one for me; I studied abroad for two summers in a French immersion program at Universite Laval in Quebec City and majored in French with an emphasis on Quebec Studies, so La Belle Province has a huge place in my heart. Quebec is a huge land area with great diversity in its landscape and people; some regions are famous for certain products (the nickname “bleuets,” blueberries, is given to people from the Lac-St-Jean area as they grow large amounts of the fruit). Quebec also produces many excellent raw milk cheeses (which are under strict control in other provinces) and maple syrup. Its culinary heritage is strongly influenced by hearty French cuisine preferred by trappers and fur traders. “Made in Quebec” is the author’s second cookbook focusing on the cuisine of Quebec; here she spent several years interviewing cheese makers, mushroom foragers, chefs and farmers, salt cod fishermen, fruit scientists and growers. The book is divided by season and include both staples (poutine, tourti&egrave;re, tarte au sucre, pate chinois) and modern interpretations of traditional flavours. I loved the simple, delicious vegetarian options like the gorgeous Tarte aux tomates confites au sirop d’&eacute;rable et cru du clocher (Tomato Tarts with Maple Syrup) on the cover; in addition to many lamb and pork dishes, there are many fish- and veggie-based dishes to enjoy. The desserts in particular are spectacular.",Positive
"The Chiappas (Michela, Emanuela, and Romina) are three Welsh-Italian sisters with a popular Channel Four TV show, Simple Italian. In their first cookbook, they include all the recipes featured on their Channel Four show, from quick and easy appetizers to a stellar guide to pasta that is worth the cost of the book. Beginning with multicolored doughs and a gluten-free basic egg pasta option, you’ll find fabulous ideas for your newfound pasta making skills, including silhouette pasta with herbs, ravioli with an oozy egg, smoked salmon and griddled asparagus, veg and meat lasagnas, pasta nests (my new go-to is the ricotta, chili, lemon and grilled vegetable nests), and gnocchi. Mains include fillet steak wrapped in pancetta and rosemary, speedy chicken with salty Parma ham and fresh sage, pork medallions with onion, apple and cider, and several vegetarian-friendly dishes like an aubergine and mozzarella bake and classic pancakes stuffed with spinach and ricotta. There are plenty of tempting veggies as well, along with soups and salads. Desserts range from poached fruit to tiramisu, layered mocha torte, and a panetonne pudding. There are lots of cultural notes, photos, and family stories interwoven into the recipes. Engaging and down-to-earth, I found the Chiappa sisters to be delightful ambassadors for “Italian flavor, British style” and much preferred this to last year's &#34;Extra Virgin&#34;).",Positive
"This gorgeous ode to Istanbul’s timeless cuisine recalls Rebecca Seal’s “Istanbul” in its photo-heavy layout and simple, straightforward mezze that can be assembled at a moment’s notice. From the embossed cover to the vibrant street scenes and mouthwatering food, this is a visual delight. Predictably, mezze star prominently, particularly yogurt-based dips and salads, pide, sigara boregi,  along with some stellar stuffed vegetables, kebabs, lamb and seafood. Sweets include apricots with clotted cream and walnuts, a pistachio baklava, orange and filo cake, and a Turkish bread and apple pudding. A gorgeous illustrated glossary rounds out the book. The next best thing to a plane ticket to Turkey, the city is as much a star as the food. I loved that every photo and restaurant mentioned also has a address listed, so you could theoretically use this as a guidebook on your next trip to Istanbul!",Positive
"Named Best Bakery in New York City by 2013 Time Out New York Food & Drink Awards, Ovenly explores culinary traditions with an unexpected twist, melding salty and sweet with a touch of spice. Their main goal is to provide joy through flavor, and their first cookbook captures this beautifully.<br /><br />Erin (who inherited her mother and grandmother's handwritten recipe cards) and Agatha (a ""refugee in the kitchen"" and daughter of Polish immigrants) have created a warm, approachable book that is full of inviting baked goods and nibbles; their tips, step-by-step photos and clear descriptions mean that any level of baker will be able to tackle these recipes and have them turn out great. I loved reading about Agatha's bilingual childhood where her parents tricked her into eating traditional Eastern European dishes like headcheese and tripe; my Polish grandmother (babcia) used to serve my mother ""chocolate soup"" (czarnina) until the day my mom found out it was actually duck's blood! And like Agatha, my babcia and great-grandmother were masters at Polish baked goods; some of my earliest memories are of helping my grandmother bake in her small apartment kitchen.<br /><br />As I am primarily a (breakfast/brunch) baker at heart, I loved Ovenly's unique take on scones (bloody Mary, cheddar mustard, currant rosemary), quick breads (strawberry basil, citrus berry), and coffee cake (poppy seed, prune, and lemon, banana Nutella). Their cookie flavors are downright revolutionary (mustard spice, bourbon chocolate chip with tarragon, the Stumptown shorty). The melding and blending of complementary flavors continues with their blue cheese apple pie with toasted walnuts, pear, sour cherry and cardamom pie, nectarine, blueberry and vanilla bean rustic tart, caramel bacon hot tarts, and goat cheese, spring onion and chive quiche. I am always on the lookout for spicy brownies that stack up against my standard Baked brownie, and the cinnamon and ancho chile brownies didn't disappoint.<br /><br />In addition to the ample selections of breakfast and brunch bakes, you'll also find a chapter of cakes and cupcakes, including the pistachio cardamom cupcakes with ganache, black chocolate stout cake with salted caramel cream cheese buttercream, and chocolate cheesecake with sour cream topping. And I loved the inclusion of bar snacks (spicy bacon caramel corn, savory rosemary popcorn, maple thyme pecans, and peppery pistachio brittle) that make the perfect nibbles with cocktails or drinks.<br /><br />One thing that did surprise me as an experienced home baker was their note on weighing ingredients: ""As we sent out our recipes for testing, we heard from friends, colleagues and family that none of them used the weight measurements we had provided. So, we decided not to use them in our book unless we felt it was necessary for a recipe."" Instead, they have created a somewhat lengthy conversion chart at the front of the book. Normally I bake solely by weight assuming it is provided as I find it to provide more accurate, consistent results (especially true with flour, which changes weight depending on humidity and other factors); I wish they had just left that in for anyone who is so inclined, but that's my personal preference.<br /><br />I loved some of the more unique advice like filing scratch marks into an aluminum or steel pan in order to aid with cutting finished brownies, bars, and shortbread that I haven't seen mentioned in my other baking books. The ""Get Creative"" sidebars marked with rolling pins will give you addition suggested variations to play with; you'll find cornflake topping for muffins, cashew butter and cayenne pepper filling for coffee cake, and nods to Eastern European pastries (jelly-filled muffins that brought to mind the paczki we eat on Mardi Gras, lemon poppyseed prune cake).<br /><br />Whether you're already a fan of Ovenly (for those lucky enough to live in New York) or simply love delicious baked goods with unusual twists, Ovenly deserves a spot of honor in your cookbook collection!<br /><br />(Thank you to Agatha and Erin for the advance copy - dziêkujê bardzo!)",Positive
"""This is indeed India...the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition...Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only."" Mark Twain<br /><br />""Spices and Seasons: Simple, Sustainable Indian Flavors"" by Rinku Bhattacharya ([[ASIN:0781813050 The Bengali Five Spice Chronicles]]) introduces readers to the cooking of today's India - a cuisine that is innovative, inspired, and full of possibilities. Many of us are only familiar with the heavy, cream-laced dishes in Indian restaurants, but Rinku's goal is to show that Indian cooking is more about flavors, freshness and love. Her emphasis on fresh, local ingredients (preferably from your own backyard, farmer's market, or CSA) and sustainability pair beautifully with Indian spices and simple, nourishing preparations that will delight family and friends.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed and printed in the USA, the book begins with several short primers to sustainability in the Indian kitchen and learning the essentials (spices, oils, tools). Unlike some Indian cookbooks, ""Spices and Seasons"" does not require a long list of exotic imported cookware, and many of the ingredients should be readily available at larger grocery stores. Each recipe has a vibrant, full-color photo illustrating it.<br /><br />Beginning with appetizers, you will find many great ideas that come together quickly. Some standouts include the mango and goat cheese mini crisps, shortcut vegetable samosas, chicken tikka and almond and saffron salmon kabobs. The remainder of the recipes are grouped by season; not surprisingly, there is a whole chapter of lentil and bean-based recipes, several of which are prepared in the slow cooker. I loved the comforting slow-cooked chickpeas with tomatoes and ginger (I used chipotles in adobo since that was what I had on hand) and the egg curries as I am always looking for new ideas to incorporate hard-boiled eggs.<br /><br />Each recipe is prefaced with a brief introduction to its region, family history, and handy tips that will ensure a great result every time. Simple, flavorful preparations make the most of seasonal ingredients. I loved the tandoori spice roasted baby potatoes with mint, broccoli with toasted cashew nuts, the autumn dishes for shrimp in a mango basil sauce and salmon with a blood orange and tamarind glaze, and rich coconut curries. Other meats are featured, but the seafood section really shines. One of my favorite discoveries was the Japanese-inspired wasabi ginger fish with fresh blackberries; the sweetness of the maple syrup and blackberries offsets the umami of the soy sauce and the pungency of the ginger.<br /><br />Chapter nine features pilafs and grains, which oftentimes are a main meal for me. There is also a chapter featuring traditional breads and crepes like naan, puri, dosas, and oothapams that take the mystery out of homemade breads to accompany your Indian feasts. Desserts are on the lighter side, and many feature fruit or fruit ices.<br /><br />Several basic wet and dry spice blends are also included (chaat masala, tandoori masala, garam masala, curry powder) that give a much different, more vibrant flavor to your finished dish than using bland premixed blends from a grocery store and it is well worth investing the extra time to make up these mixes in advance.<br /><br />In addition to being very suitable for vegetarians and pescetarians (there are many meat-free options and appealing seafood recipes), there is a gluten-free and vegan/vegetarian index and all recipes are also marked as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.<br /><br />This is one of those rare cookbooks that I am compelled to cook my way through cover to cover; I have not had the pleasure of reading / cooking from Rinku's first book ""The Bengali Five Spice Chronicles,"" but based on my experience with ""Spices and Seasons,"" it will be next on my list!<br /><br />Verdict: ""Spices and Seasons"" is an absolute must-own for anyone who enjoys Indian food or is simply looking for simple, healthful ways to make the most of an abundance of garden vegetables or a CSA box.<br /><br />Thank you to Rinku for the review copy!",Positive
"As a vegetarian/pescetarian, Greek food has long appealed to me. Two of my favorite Greek cookbooks are [[ASIN:0312200765 The Greek Vegetarian: More Than 100 Recipes Inspired by the Traditional Dishes and Flavors of Greece]]and [[ASIN:0688175112 Meze: Small Plates to Savor and Share from the Mediterranean Table]], both by Greek-American cookbook author Diane Kochilas. Kochilas has written nearly 20 books on Greek and Mediterranean cuisine and is a collaborating chef at Molyvos in New York. Her cooking philosophy is rooted in the tenets of the Greek-Mediterranean Diet: keep it simple, respect seasonality, use ingredients that have integrity and are easy to find, eat lots of greens and vegetables, share, and finally, the golden rule - Nothing in Excess.<br /><br />So I was super-excited to see that Kochilas had a new cookbook coming out that focuses on the cuisine of Ikaria, her ancestral homeland and the location of her cooking school Glorious Greek Kitchen. Kochilas has devoted her life to promoting the natural, healthy and delicious foods of Greece.. Her new book ""Ikaria: Lessons on Food, Life, and Longevity from the Greek Island Where People Forget to Die"" chronicles the wisdom and food traditions of generations of Ikarians. More than just a collection of excellent recipes, this is a unique glimpse into an island where time seems to stand still and the worries and stresses of modern life melt away.<br /><br />Ikaria is one of the world's Blue Zones, a place where inhabitants reach age 100 at rates 10 times greater than in the United States. The organic, unprocessed diet of Ikarians, as well as regular physical activity, laid-back attitude, and arguably nonexistent relationship with time (shops around the island read ""Clocks, Anxiety and Stress Have No Place on Ikaria"") are likely all contributing factors. Kochilas' interviews with Ikaria's octogenarians and above reveal a positive attitude and joy for life that we can all learn from.<br /><br />After an introduction explaining the Blue Zones, The Ikaria Study and the rhythms of traditional Ikarian life, the delicious recipes begin. In keeping with the unprocessed foods of Ikaria, most recipes call for only a handful of ingredients. There are instructions for making homemade goat cheese, homemade phyllo dough, and for drying vegetables for preservation. The chapter on salads features a very thorough lexicon of edible greens and wild herbs, including medicinal uses. Along the way, sidebars provide more in-depth info on particular ingredients, techniques, and local festivals.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, vegetables play a starring role in this book. An entire chapter devoted to using vegetables as a main course includes baked, stewed, braised, and stuffed veggies that will give you plenty of creative ideas for how to make the most of the season's bounty. One of my favorite discoveries was a delicious variation on stuffed grape leaves using collard greens and dried corn. The chapter on savory pies and breads includes a recipe for homemade phyllo, spanakopita and stuffed pies, fried hand pies, and skillet puffs and griddle pies.<br /><br />Ikarians are blessed with an abundance of fish and seafood, which is integral to the Ikarian diet. Small fish are fried, while large fish are generally grilled, baked, or made into soup. Meat is ""consumed regularly but sparingly, more as a condiment than as a main-course protein,"" according to the author. Goat meat is the most popular meat on Ikaria, and you'll find several wonderful, unfussy preparations here including baby goat braised with fennel, oregano-roasted goat, and baby goat with yogurt avgolemono that are the perfect introduction to this versatile staple.<br /><br />In addition to making several of the mezedes (including the whipped feta spread), I loved the lentil salad with fennel, onions, and lots of herbs; the touch of mint and dill gave an unexpected brightness to the lentils. I opted for a lemon-infused olive oil as I thought it would pair well with the fresh herbs (many of the legume recipes in the book call for a splash of lemon juice). I absolutely adored the baked zucchini fritters with oregano and mint and appreciated that several of the fried recipes also included lighter baked alternatives. As a sweet finale, I baked the spice cake for the revealing saint (fanouropita) in a decorative Bundt pan -- it makes the perfect afternoon treat with a cup of Greek coffee.<br /><br />Sprinkled throughout the book are gorgeous portraits of Ikaria's landscape and architecture, Ikarians engaged in daily activities and festivals, and mouthwatering food photography. The book is rounded out with resources, including a bilingual Greek/English bibliography, and a very handy metric conversion chart that also features pan sizes. Recipe names are given in English and transliterated Greek.<br /><br />This is a fabulous addition to your Mediterranean cookbook library and a wonderful introduction to regional Greek cooking. We can all stand to learn a thing or two about eating and living well from Ikaria!<br /><br />(This review originally appeared on Mediterranean Living as the October spotlight review)",Positive
"Winner of the 2013 Gourmand Award: Best First Cookbook and Best Cookbook Photography, the beautiful ""Cook in Israel: Home Cooking Inspiration"" will lead you on a colorful journey through (kosher) Israeli cuisine. Packed with delicious, easy to follow recipes, ""Cook in Israel"" draws on the author's Jewish-Greek heritage and the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors of her Tel Aviv home. Orly has been offering popular cooking classes and culinary tours of Israel since 2009. ""The culinary tours are a way to introduce tourists visiting Israel, who are excited by the freshness of the vegetables and fruits here and create a way to bring visitors closer to our food,"" Orly explains.<br /><br />Filled with 100 (mostly vegetarian) recipes, many with step-by-step photos, cooking from ""Cook in Isreal"" is like taking a personal class with Orly. Most of the recipes take 30 minutes or less to prepare, making them perfect for weeknight dinners. Recipes for Jewish holidays are included. A former clinical nutritionist, Orly's recipes are healthy, flavorful and easy to prepare. The recipes in the book reflect the way Orly's family cooks and eats and are inspired by her mother and grandmother, the local shuk (market) and by all the cultures that have come to Israel.<br /><br />Given Orly's Greek / Sephardic heritage, it's not surprising to see many dishes with eggplant featured prominently (baba ghanoush, eggplant baladi, Turkish-style eggplant, roasted eggplant, Greek-style eggplant salad, eggplant with Bulgarian cheese, eggplant siniye, etc.). I really appreciated the many creative (and tasty) ways to use this versatile fruit (eggplant is technically a large berry).  I also loved the many refreshing salads (raw beet and apple, orange and fennel, cabbage and cranberry salad, carrot and pecan salad, parsley, nuts, and feta cheese salad) and the green shakshuka, which I had not seen before. The book's photography by Katherine Martinelli deserves special mention; all the photographs were shot in Orly's home.<br /><br />I've made several of the recipes in ""Cook in Israel"" including several salads, a fish recipe, a sweet bread recipe and a cookie recipe. Each recipe is prefaced with a short history of a dish (or a food memory attached to it).  Although I love salmon, I'd never tried preparing it at home.  After making Orly's salmon baked with mustard and honey (only three ingredients - salmon, mustard and honey), I'm no longer intimidated by cooking fish at home and can't wait to try some of the other recipes like fish with green tahini sauce and the fish kebabs with yellow tahini yogurt sauce.<br /><br />I also made the Bukharan chickpea pastry, and I loved her simple take on the Sephardic mainstay borekas using puff pastry dough (since these are already dairy, I prefer to use French puff pastry made with butter, such as Dufour, instead of Pepperidge Farm, which is pareve). I loved the dairy dishes like baked pasta for Shavuot.<br /><br />I made the chocolate halvah babka and the date and walnut pinwheel cookies from the sweets chapter; the step-by-step photos were a huge help for figuring out how to cut and braid the babka (I'm used to making three-strand challahs, but trying to braid a two-strand rope was trickier!). The date and walnut cookies reminded me of ones my Iraqi students would bring to class; I loved the touch of rosewater and spices in the filling and dough.<br /><br />Naturally, the biggest challenge (depending on your local supermarket) will be sourcing some of the ingredients such as date spread, date honey (silan), halvah, rosewater, etc. called for, but these are mostly found in the sweets chapter and can easily be located online. You can also make your own date spread at home by cooking pitted Medjool dates and a little water until it cooks down to a thick paste, which is what I did when I tried this recipe as I had a surplus of Medjool dates to use up!<br /><br />One additional observation is that like some other Israeli cookbooks I've seen, the amount of a given ingredient may be up to the chef (a recipe will say ""diced olives,"" or ""chocolate spread"" with no recommended amount), or there are no detailed instructions for a given step (""roast the eggplants under a broiler"" with no recommended temp/ time), but most recipes include very simple instructions and uncomplicated ingredient lists that make these perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.<br /><br />This is a wonderful introduction to vegetarian-friendly Sephardic and Israeli cuisine (the book is largely pescetarian / vegetarian with a couple of meat-based recipes); the recipes are appealing, full of fresh herbs and veggies, simple to put together, and there are plenty of tips and step-by-step photos that make ""Cook in Israel"" perfect for any level of chef. My next goal will be taking one of Orly's ""Cook in Israel"" cooking classes and tours in Israel!<br /><br />You can find more info on Orly's culinary tours and cooking classes at http://www.cookinisrael.com/<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of the author)",Positive
"A baker since a young age, Victoria Glass is an expert cake maker and owner of Victoria's Cake Boutique. The author of [[ASIN:184975263X Boutique Wedding Cakes: bake and decorate beautiful cakes at home]], she was featured in a recent retro-themed issue of the UK magazine Baking Heaven and recently released her second cookbook, ""Deliciously Vintage.""<br /><br />""Deliciously Vintage"" rounds up sixty favorite bakes from around the globe, including a wonderful selection of British standards (Jammy Dodgers, rock cakes, fat rascals, Chelsea buns, Bakewell tart, Battenberg cake, puddings) as well as international offerings (Australian Lamingtons, French madeleines, eclairs and clafoutis, South African melktert, Austrian Sachertorte, and many American contributions such as Mississippi mud pie, hummingbird cake, and  Boston cream pie). Each recipe has a charming little story that gives background on a particular recipe; I found the British ones particularly amusing with schoolyard humor (""squashed fly cakes"" for Eccles cakes, ""dead man's arm"" for the jelly roll).<br /><br />Divided into biscuits and cookies, small cakes and bakes, large cakes, pastries, and desserts, you'll be sure to find the perfect baked good for any occasion, whether a dainty tea party (madeleines, Florentines, cream buns, lemon drizzle cake), elegant European coffee (Opera cake, Sachertorte, Kugelhopf),  to a (children's) birthday party (cute butterfly cakes, PB&J cake, devil's food cake - hot chilis optional, although the chili horns make a particularly devilish touch indeed!). Best of all, ingredients should all be commonly available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />Recipes are given in Imperial and US (volume) measurements; along with ingredients, you will also find a list of all required bakeware at the bottom of the page. I made the Chelsea buns and the Bakewell tart first; the Chelsea buns are much leaner than traditional American cinnamon rolls (also featured in the book), and you can substitute whatever dried fruit you have on hand for the filling. Victoria's instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, with helpful hints throughout (she was also kind enough to write back promptly when I had difficulties with a test recipe).<br /><br />As with other Ryland Peters & Small titles, layout and design deserve a special mention. The book has a delightfully retro feel about it, from the red-and-white trim on the cover and matching endpapers to the old-fashioned china and linens in the photos. Each recipe features a full-color photograph on the facing page, and the background of the page featuring the recipe carries over elements from the staged photo. I love that touch with all their books as it lends a sense of continuity that serves to tie the recipe and its photo together.<br /><br />I loved the wide range of international desserts from the UK, Finland, France, Australia, Austria and the US, and these are simple, down to earth bakes that can be accomplished in a relatively short time. Victoria did a lot of baking with her mother and grandmother as a child, and that love shines through in ""Deliciously Vintage;"" it's sure to delight bakers of all ages and there is enough variety to keep you baking happily for many months to come!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)",Positive
"I recently started making my own cheese with the ""[[ASIN:0761177485 One-Hour Cheese: Ricotta, Mozzarella, Ch&egrave;vre, Paneer--Even Burrata. Fresh and Simple Cheeses You Can Make in an Hour or Less!]]"", and was looking to expand my fledgling cheesemaking to cr&egrave;me fraiche and mascarpone...enter ""The Creamery Kitchen."" My first exposure to ""The Creamery Kitchen"" came in the latest issue of the UK baking magazine ""Baking Heaven Savoury;"" I've discovered several great British cookbooks through the magazine, including [[ASIN:0297869388 The Pocket Bakery]].<br /><br />Jenny Linford is a freelance food writer, a member of the Guild of Food Writers and author of fifteen books ranging from cookery books to ingredient guides. Her interest in food stems from living as a child in Singapore and Italy. In ""The Creamery Kitchen"" she gives both instructions how to make simple dairy products (butter, buttermilk, sour cream, cr&egrave;me fraiche, yogurt, labneh, cream cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta, mascarpone, feta-style cheese) and showcases simple recipes using those products (storebought works just fine if you're in a pinch). There is a brief introduction to ""Creating your creamery"" and ingredients, although I wish the author gave recommendations on substituting vegetarian rennet tablets for liquid rennet, which is what the recipes here call for (I purchased vegetarian rennet tablets in bulk when I bought One-Hour cheese).<br /><br />Starting with simple yet delicious flavored butters (fennel, caramelized, piquant, fragrant spice, rose, and saffron butters), you'll find a chilled cucumber and mint soup with parmesan crisps that is perfect for a sweltering summer day, elegant beetroot latkes with smoked salmon and cr&egrave;me fraiche, asparagus, pea and labneh salad, not one but two variations of the classic Balkan burek, ricotta and spinach dumplings, cheesecakes, and even spaghetti with gorgonzola, pecan and mascarpone sauce. The recipes are straightforward and come together quickly with impressive results.<br /><br />Most of the recipes are vegetarian with a few meat-based recipes (buttermilk fried chicken, lamb skewers, lamb and asparagus tacos with roasted tomato salsa). I loved the distinctly Middle Eastern flavor in the orange semolina cake and roasted red pepper, pomegranate and sumac raita, lamb skewers with za'atar labneh, and dukkah flatbreads with herbed labneh, and saffron and cardamom labneh with mango. There are also some Italian-inspired gems like the spaghetti with gorgonzola, pecan and mascarpone sauce and ricotta and spinach dumplings with cherry tomato sauce. Dairy-based desserts, including sour cream raisin pie, coeur a la cr&egrave;me with strawberries and passion fruit, yogurt gelato, whisky and raspberry cranachan cheesecakes, and fig and honey ricotta cheesecake, make up the majority of the offerings.<br /><br />As with other Ryland Peters & Small titles, each recipe is lavishly photographed and layout is clear yet compact on matte pages. At certain points in the recipe / instructions, a cursive font is used that is a bit smaller than the regular sans serif font. Measurements are given in both metric and American measurements. British cooking terms/ingredients give American equivalents when possible (clingfilm = plastic wrap, courgette = zucchini, single cream = light cream, etc.).<br /><br />I tried the lemon thyme feta loaf and orange syrup semolina cake, which is basically a revani/basbousa. The lemon thyme feta loaf was tremendously fragrant and moist from the olive oil and zucchini. My one recommendation is taste your feta first if using storebought as it can be tremendously salty. The recipe calls for 1 tsp salt as written, but I included both the salt and feta and found it was a bit too salty for my taste; next time I will cut back on or eliminate the salt entirely. I baked it in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] pan, which makes for a festive appearance (see photo). For the semolina cake, the cr&egrave;me fraiche took the place of the yogurt I normally use, and although the recipe yielded less syrup than I am accustomed to using, the finished cake turned out perfectly moist and froze well, making it a perfect teatime or breakfast snack.. I loved the chilled soups and simple and easy fresh veggie salads like the asparagus, pea and labneh salad and the broad bean, feta and dill salad; perfect when it's too hot to feel like heating up the oven.<br /><br />Overall this is a great first book if you're new to making soft cheeses and dairy products at home; the instructions and recipes are simple and straightforward and most use ingredients that you should already have on hand (except for some of the Middle Eastern spices like sumac, za'atar, and cardamom and some basic cheesemaking supplies like rennet and cheesecloth). I loved the variety of dairy-based Mediterranean/Balkan/Middle Eastern dishes as this is my favorite cuisine, and I love that the preparation is manageable and the recipe yields are small (most main dishes serve 4-6). This is an excellent counterpart to One-Hour Cheese, which focuses on firm cheeses as opposed to creams and soft cheeses, and I will certainly find myself coming back to the ""Creamery Kitchen"" on a regular basis. If you are interested in learning to make your own cr&egrave;me fraiche, mascarpone, yogurt, cottage cheese, and feta, this is the book for you. And I concur with the reviewer who stated `""...by the end of the book, I was ready to buy my own cow!""<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)",Positive
"Mediterranean food has long appealed to me for several reasons; as a light eater, I prefer the mezze / tapas tradition of grazing from several small dishes versus a large sit-down meal, the emphasis on fresh seasonal produce with simple, uncomplicated flavors to allow the fruits and veggies to shine through, and the fact that so many wonderful dips, spreads, salads, and main dishes are vegetarian-friendly.<br /><br />DK's ""Mediterranean Cookbook"" provides readers with the tools to master more than 300 authentic recipes from the Greek Islands, Spain, Provence, northern Africa, and the Middle East. Recipes are structured by type of food, rather than country of origin, and feature spreads showcase the iconic foods of key regions such as Provence and Tuscany. In typical DK fashion (I own several of their Eyewitness travel guides for Spain, Italy, and Japan), lush photography assists readers in their journey to prepare meals with confidence. Marie-Pierre Moine provides recipes from France and Turkey, While Elisabeth Luard and Ghillie Basan contribute delicious recipes from the western Mediterranean and the Middle East. (I own several of Ms. Basan's other titles on Middle Eastern and North African cooking, including [[ASIN:1849754322 Vegetarian Tagines & Cous Cous: 65 Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One Pot Cooking]], so was happy to see her name as a contributor here).<br /><br />Beginning appropriately enough with mezze, tapas and antipasti, you'll find a wealth of new and familiar favorites like tapenade, canap&eacute;s a la brousse et aux figues (goat cheese, lavender honey, and figs on a toasted baguette), pasteis de bacalhau, hummus and baba ganoush, stuffed grape leaves, and Moroccan fish cakes.<br /><br />As eggs are one of my favorite foods, I really appreciated the eggs chapter, which features such gems as ouefs mimosa a la nicoise (hard-boiled eggs stuffed with black olive tapenade, aioli, lemon zest and topped with anchovy fillets), beid bi tom, uovo alla sarda (eggs in the style of stuffed sardines), shakshouka, piperade, tortilla de primavera and tortilla de habas from Spain, Turkish cilbir, and the pastry-based dishes avga tiropita and brik with eggs.<br /><br />The seafood chapter deserves a special mention for its wonderful whole fish preparations, tajines, bacalao, kebobs and of course that iconic Spanish dish paella, here with handy step-by-step photos. Spanish fabada, cocideo madrileno, and cassoulet are just the ticket for cold winter days. There are some real showstoppers like pato amb peras (duck with glazed pears) for fancier dinner parties. Pizzas, spanakopita, lahma bi ajeen, and bstilla make wonderful portable snacks or delightful nibbles on the patio or terrace.<br /><br />I tried the hortapitta recipe, and found I could have done with a few more instructions; the spanakopita recipe specified the size of the phyllo sheets, while the hortapitta recipe simply said ""10 oz. package of phyllo dough."" Also, the spanakopita recipe called for a 9 x 12 pan, while the hortapitta recipe simply said ""brush a baking sheet with a little melted butter and layer in two-thirds of the phyllo sheets."" I found this a little too vague and wasn't sure about the size of the pan (this is only supposed to serve four), so I had to cut down the phyllo sheets to fit. Another step I found odd between the two recipes was the spanakopita called for preparing the filling first, then assembling, while the hortapitta recipe has you begin to layer the phyllo in the pan then prepare the filling, which takes a good 10-15 minutes, allowing the phyllo to dry out. I decided to assemble mine right before baking instead. I loved the flavor of the filling, but had miscalculated the amount of phyllo (it would be helpful if it listed the phyllo sheet size / number of sheets / suggested baking pan size). Other recipes had clearer instructions; I loved the sigari boregi, panzerotti, and empanadillas de atun.<br /><br />I also loved some of the unique salads and vegetable preparations such as the Sicilian orange salad, patlican salatasi, and mahshi felfel. The tomatoes deserve special mention, especially the tomates a la provencale and tomates confites. As I am primarily a baker, the fatayer bi zahtar, khubz bil hummus, fougasse aux olives, crostini napolitana were wonderful and easy enough to be in frequent rotation.<br /><br />To end your Mediterranean meal or tapas party on a sweet note are a variety of fruit-based desserts, including amaretti-stuffed peaches, Moroccan orange salad, membrillo, and pears poached in Marsala. You'll also find Middle Eastern puddings, flan, cheesecake, a showstopping cassata gelato from Sicily, and an intriguing pine nut - candied fruit tart from Provence. The Galician favorite pastel de Santiago makes an appearance, as do Tuscan chestnut flour cake, Sicilian cannoli, and the gorgeous (and delicious) Moroccan m'hanncha and Greek baklava.<br /><br />From the book's attractive ""tiled"" cover featuring typical Mediterranean fruits and veggies to the gorgeous photography of ingredients and feature spreads on spotlight cuisine (Tuscany, Greece, Lebanon, Morocco, Spain, Sicily, Provence, Turkey), you are sure to find many dishes to fall in love with whether this is your first Mediterranean cookbook or you are a seasoned pro. The many helpful photos and sidebars on Mediterranean ingredients and step-by-step photos for some of the more complicated dishes make this a great choice for new cooks, although you may need to refer back to similar recipes for more guidance as previously mentioned.<br /><br />DK's ""Mediterranean Cookbook"" is quickly becoming my go-to for Mediterranean dishes from appetizers to dessert without having to reach for individual cookbooks focusing on specific countries or ingredients; you'll find enough variety to keep you happily experimenting for months to come!<br /><br />(Thank you to DK for the review copy!)",Positive
"Prashad is an Indian vegetarian restaurant in West Yorkshire that was named Best Restaurant by no less than Gordon Ramsay. The word ""Prashad"" means ""sacred offering"" and refers to religious food offerings left at temples. Amazon happened to recommend Prashad to me as I was looking at other UK-authored vegetarian cookbooks. I was instantly intrigued, as I am quite familiar with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern vegetarian cuisine, but Indian cuisine is relatively unknown to me other than some Indian restaurant standards like tikka masala and saag paneer. I've been vegetarian for over ten years and am always on the lookout for new dishes to add to my repertoire, and ""Prashad"" opened my eyes (and my spice cupboard!) to the myriad of flavors and textures in Gujarati cuisine and introduced me to new ways of cooking that will make it into my regular rotation, particularly how to make masalas and tarkas (heating spices in hot oil). Gujarati cuisine is also very vegetarian-friendly as it is strongly influenced by Jain vegetarianism and traditional Hinduism.<br /><br />I reached out to Prashad through Facebook and the restaurant was kind enough to send out an autographed review copy from the UK. The book is written by matriarch Kaushy (her son Bobby is the current owner and manager of the restaurant). Kaushy's four simple rules (fresh and fantastic, prepare, relax, and cook with love) and clear instructions make this flavorful vegetarian cuisine accessible to any level of cook. As many of the cooking utensils and ingredients were new to me, I particularly appreciated the illustrated guide to ingredients and utensils and the several pages of practical points, top tips and how to (roasting seeds, stopping eggplant from oxidizing, stopping dhal from foaming over, preventing tarka spices from burning, balancing spicy foods, etc.) Sharing extra food with friends and neighbors (""vakti vevar"") is also an important step to creating community bonds in Gujarati culture. The several sample menus in the back will allow you to create an authentic Gujarati feast for family and friends with plenty to share!<br /><br />As this is a UK cookbook, recipes are in metric / temperatures in Celsius, but as I frequently cook using metric, this is no issue as long as you have a good kitchen scale. Many of the starters / appetizers are fried, but Kaushy also provides instructions for baking them for a lower-fat alternative, which I greatly appreciated as I try to avoid fried foods. You will also find variations that will add extra mileage, and serving suggestions on what to pair each recipe with (I liked that the page numbers were provided for quick reference and tabbed those so I could quickly flip back and forth between the two). Beautiful full-color photos on matte paper and colorful illustrations of elephants and geometric prints give a much-needed splash of color and makes the pages ""pop"". At the back of the book is a guide of Kaushy's suggested brands, although most may only be available in the UK or online (the only commercial brand I saw near me was Deep). The clear step-by-step instructions with helpful visual and auditory cues (""when the mustard seeds begin to pop, turn the heat to low"") make you feel as though Kaushy is standing next to you guiding you;  Kaushy also gives cooking classes at The Cooking School at Dean Clough Mills, which I would love to attend.<br /><br />I also loved the sample menus for special occasion feasts, weekend dinner party, and three sample quick midweek suppers. This section is particularly well-suited for new cooks, as Kaushy gives timing instructions for each step of the dinner so all the dishes are ready at the same time. This is extremely helpful and something which is frequently left out of other cookbooks.<br /><br />The most difficult challenge will undoubtedly be finding the fresh Indian vegetables, pulses, and specialty flour blends locally; even with an Indian and Middle Eastern grocery store at my disposal, I was unable to source some of the more ""exotic"" ingredients like colocasia leaves, hyacinth beans,  and bottle gourd, but found enough staples to make several of the dishes that caught my eye, including the pethis (garlic-coconut filled potato balls), handvo (seed topped lentil cake), paneer tikka (with homemade paneer that I added curry powder to from [[ASIN:0761177485 One-Hour Cheese: Ricotta, Mozzarella, Chèvre, Paneer--Even Burrata. Fresh and Simple Cheeses You Can Make in an Hour or Less!]]), ferar bataka (ginger-chili peanuts and potatoes), and chole. Some of the dishes like chole come together quickly, while others like the handvo require time for prep (the dough must ferment at least 12 hours). There is also a chapter on rice dishes and breads that includes many Gujarati staples such as rotli, bhakri, juvar na rotla, paratha, puri and bathura.<br /><br />I have a notorious sweet tooth and am quite familiar with Middle Eastern desserts like baklava and basbousa and some Indian desserts like gulab jamun, but loved the carrot pudding, dhud pak (cardamom, almond and pistachio rice pudding) and mava lapsi (spiced fruit, nut, and cracked wheat pudding, which reminded me of the Ukrainian kutya) from Prashad. I enjoyed trying out some of the accompanying dishes like imli chutney; tamarind is easy to find in my town both fresh and dried, and I loved the tangy sweet-sour-spicy kick this gave to dishes. I am particularly fond of chutneys and pickles, which had always intimidated me before (I will admit to buying commercial chutney, which always seemed lacking or too sweet). I can't wait to try the murabho (cinnamon and cardamom-infused sweet mango pickle) as mangoes are plentiful in my city; I use piloncillo in place of jaggery as it is much easier to come by in my neck of the woods.<br /><br />Pleasing to the eyes and stomach, Prashad opened up a whole new world of flavors and cooking techniques from Gujarati cuisine; a second Prashad cookbook is currently in the works, and based on the fabulous recipes and cultural tidbits in the first book, it will be on my must-buy list!<br /><br />(Thank you to Kaushy, Bobby, and the Prashad staff for the review copy and I hope to visit you in Drighlington one day!)",Positive
"Has finally been demystified in the lighthearted (and uber-delicious) ""The Book of Buns"" by Jane Mason, the author of [[ASIN:1849752575 All You Knead Is Bread: Over 50 Recipes from Around the World to Bake & Share]]. Hint: it's not the gym. From page 9: ""If you want firm buns, go to the gym. The joy of buns is the fluffy, soft squishiness of them.""  And the book's dedication: ""To Enrique who loves my buns.""<br /><br />Containing over 50 recipes for various types of sweet and savory buns from (virtually) every corner of the globe, you'll be sure to make several tasty new discoveries that will make their way into your regular baking rotation. Not surprisingly, many of the recipes are European; hot cross buns, saffron buns, Chelsea buns and Lincolnshire plum buns from the UK, numerous sweet buns from Switzerland, Norway, Hungary, and Armenia, pirozhki and bublik from Eastern Europe, and plenty of crusty German rolls to round things out.  Latin America is also well represented, with recipes from Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and El Salvador. The Middle East/ Africa offers numerous buns such as ka'ak (Syria),  khubza bil ashab (Libya), khubz mahala and bun muska (Iran), khubz mbassis (Tunisia), meloui (Morocco), and shubbak el-habayeb (Iraq). You'll also find Montreal-style bagels and monkey  bread from North America. There is truly something for everyone represented here!<br /><br />Ingredients (both metric and volume) and instructions are very clearly laid out, and a helpful guide to ingredients, working with dough, and basic shaping and filling techniques will get you started on the right foot. Each recipe is illustrated with a photo of the finished bun, and many feature numbered step-by-step photos as well, which are tremendously helpful for the more involved recipes. All of these recipes freeze well and can be reheated quickly in the microwave or oven.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Lebanese sfoof, a beautiful yellow bun twisted into elegant rings and sprinkled with chopped pistachios. The addition of mahlab, anise seeds, and orange blossom water give these a delicate spice; due to the 30 minutes of hand kneading, they are moist and fluffy and go excellently with Turkish coffee.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried was the bastounakia (literally ""salt sticks,"") a sourdough-ish Greek breadstick made with plenty of chopped fresh rosemary. I also brushed mine with [[ASIN:B004HIZ7HW Amoretti Premium Organic Extra Virgin finishing Olive Oil Infused with the Natural Flavor & Aroma of Kalamata Olives - 500ml Bottle]] and Cornish sea salt that took these over the top. These would pair well with any salad or soup.<br /><br />The third recipe I tried as the dolce Milanese, a sweet layered bun filled with a pound of raisins (I threw together the remnants of my dried fruit, so mine was a mix of currants, golden raisins, and regular raisins). I should have done a better job draining the raisins (including patting them off with paper towels), because I found the dough unpleasantly wet to work with during the several rounds of folding in the fruit. However, the final bread was moist and flaky (if a little heavy from all the fruit!) and froze well.<br /><br />I also made several of the Asian-inspired recipes including the coconut buns from China (you will also find several variations on Chinese steamed dumplings) and Japanese anpan. Having lived in Japan, I am addicted to anpan and other sweet buns (red beans, green tea, and red bean paste are frequent ingredients in Japanese pastry), and enjoyed making my own at home. I have bookmarked numerous other recipes to try, including the amazing Bulgarian layered cheese bread tootmanik s gotovo testo, masala buns from India, Moroccan krachel, and South African chocolate sticks.<br /><br />Some general observations: I baked all my buns on a Silpat, and I turned down the heat quite a bit from what was recommended (I tend to bake most of my breads at 350, and perhaps a few minutes at 375 to brown; many of the buns here call for temps as high as 400-425). Also, the author tends to use a lot of salt; I am sensitive to salt, so I cut the recommended amount in half. The bastounakia calls for 2 - 2.5 tsp. for only 16 breadsticks, for example. There is no salt in the dough for this particular recipe, so I went with a light hand when sprinkling the breadsticks. You can also use sourdough in place of yeast; the author gives detailed recommendations for substituting rye- and wheat-based starters for the yeast.<br /><br />One great bonus is the fact that you will develop the arms of a stevedore after hand-kneading all these doughs; I'm a firm believer in hand-kneading over a stand mixer as it gives you a much better ""feel"" for when the dough is ready. It is also a great workout for your arms!<br /><br />Overall, ""The Book of Buns"" is a great way to try out sweet and savory bread recipes from around the world in a portable (and freezable!) format. There is plenty of variety to keep you baking happily for many weeks / months to come; if you try one bun recipe a week, you can pretty much get a year's worth of bakes! The clear lists of ingredients, instructions, and directions (and the helpful step-by-step photos) make this approachable by any level of baker, and there are very little specialty flours / ingredients required (with the exception of mahlab and orange blossom water), so you should be able to locate ingredients at your local supermarket. I strongly suggest purchasing a Silpat if you do not already own own; it has revolutionized my bread baking and makes cleanup a snap, plus it is reusable for hundreds of uses.<br /><br />Good luck and happy baking!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters and Small)",Positive
"I own numerous Cook's Illustrated cookbooks and have subscribed to their print and online magazine over the years; their articles on kitchen tips, techniques and troubleshooting have been a lifesaver on more than one occasion.  However, there is also a downside; sometimes you simply want a straightforward recipe without having to read several paragraphs (or pages) of exposition about the various test recipes that were flops before arriving at a successful outcome. But most times, the detailed tips, helpful product ratings / reviews and suggested brands of pantry staples more than make up for an overly ""scholarly"" tone.<br /><br />I consider myself an experienced home baker. I own upwards of 50 baking books alone, along with an arsenal of professional bakeware that I use regularly, so I was very happy to review The Cook's Illustrated Baking Book. It takes a noble stab at introducing the reader to most major categories of baking, including quick breads, yeast breads, cookies, brownies / bar cookies, cakes (chiffon, angel food, pound, Bundt, fruit, layer), fruit desserts, pies and tarts, quiches, pastry, and baked custards, puddings and souffl&eacute;s.<br /><br />Beginning with the basics, you'll find a great illustrated guide to baking ingredients, including how to measure and store sugar, butter temperatures (including what butter should ""look like"" at the various temperature points of chilled, softened, and melted and cooled), and chocolate. There's a good breakdown of the advantages / disadvantages of the  major types of bakeware (tempered glass, dark finishes, insulated, cast iron, silicone), and ten tips for better baking.<br /><br />On to the recipes themselves: as with many Cook's Illustrated cookbooks, you will have one master recipe followed by several variations on a theme (these variations are listed on the main page of the recipe, not as separate listings as in some cookbooks). You'll also find recipes for quick and easy accompaniments like spreads. I tried the chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies with pecans and dried cherries; the cookies seemed almost a touch too sweet (1.5 cups of dark brown sugar), so next time I may scale back slightly, but the flavor combo of chopped tart cherries, bittersweet chocolate chunks and toasted pecans was great, as was the texture. I also appreciated the cookie troubleshooting tips, as cookies are the one item I don't bake frequently. In addition to chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter, you'll find many favorites such as rugelach and biscotti. Similarly, pie dough is given an entire page of illustrations to demonstrate the right way to roll out the crust, fitting the dough, and finishing a single and double-crust pie. There are also some showstopping cakes featured, like the chocolate espresso dacquoise and the apple galette, that will give more experienced bakers a challenge.<br /><br />At the very back is a shopping guide of equipment and ingredients (with photos) that will make it easy to source recommended brands (yes, I really do recommend the [[ASIN:B0015VTR20 Frieling Handle-It Glass Bottom Springform, 9-Inch]]; despite the steep price, it is a great pan that turns out beautiful cheesecakes). I like that they include several different price points for higher-end items; a new baker/chef might do well with an inexpensive Dutch oven, but if you plan on using one regularly, then it's worth splurging for a higher-end one like Staub or Le Creuset).<br /><br />Granted, no one baking book can cover everything, and certain sections towards the end (like the croissants / laminated dough) felt more like an afterthought (croissants could easily take up several chapters alone!), but overall the Cook's Illustrated Baking Book does a good job at covering major categories at a decent price. A few downsides: ALL the photos are black and white, there is no section devoted to holiday baking, and many of the master recipes (and variations) can be found in pretty much any other baking book, but the illustrations, photos and hints make this particularly helpful for those new to baking.",Positive
"I purchased my first slow cooker recently, and use it several times a week to make soups, breads, beans and whole grains. When I first started looking for slow cooker cookbooks, I checked out [[ASIN:1933615699 Slow Cooker Revolution]] from the library and was disappointed by the large number of recipes that called for lengthy prep both pre- and post-slow cooking, relied on canned/processed shortcuts, and microwaving ingredients.<br /><br />Enter the Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2: All 200 recipes have 15 minutes or less of prep, making it easy to get your meal started quickly. Yes, there are still some recipes that call for microwaving veggies (and raw pasta!) prior to slow cooking, and you could also choose to do it on the stovetop if you have a slow cooker with a nonstick insert. However, most of the ingredient lists are much more manageable. Yes, there are still some recipes like the macaroni and cheese with broccoli and parmesan or the chicken pizzaiola that use condensed soup or jarred pasta sauce, but many more recipes appealed to me, like the cherry-sage or apricot ginger glazed chicken, vegetarian entrees, and especially the meals for two. I'm usually only cooking for one and end up with far too many leftovers, so it's nice to have options for smaller yields without having to do the math (I tried the poached salmon and it was so easy!). I also liked the fact that the slow cooker size is referenced; in the dips chapter, for those of us with larger slow cookers (5-7 quarts), you're instructed to bake your dip in a souffle dish; I use my [[ASIN:B0006TJ7FO Pillivuyt Porcelain 6-Cup, 6-1/2-Inch Deep Classic Pleated Souffle Dish]] on top of a [[ASIN:B007QHYPFG Spice Ratchet Blossom Multi-Use Purple Flower Trivet]].<br /><br />There's also a wide range of international influences, from Mediterranean whole grain salads and Provencal chicken to Tex-Mex, Asian, and Italian favorites, that will keep me cooking happily for many months to come. Like other America's Test Kitchen books, you'll find recommendations for various brands and equipment or helpful tips for each recipe. I've already made several recipes including the garlicky shrimp, poached salmon, and warm lentil salad, and would definitely make all three again.",Positive
"I have loved and used my original edition of ""Artisan Bread in Five"" and gifted several friends with copies - it truly changed my baking habits and has allowed me to put away my bread machine and make homemade bread and rolls (even pastries) at least once a week. Predictably, I was overjoyed when I was offered the chance to review the New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes A Day, featuring many more photos, new recipes (including a whole chapter on gluten-free dough), and updated information.<br /><br />You'll now find revised proofing times, updated equipment guides (I recently purchased a [[ASIN:B00DQCC282 Emile Henry Red Bread Cloche]] so I was pleased to see new instructions for proofing and baking in clay bakers or a covered cast-iron pot). Like any baking book worth its salt, recipes are given in (volume, weight, and metric measurements. New (and appreciated) additions include Crock Pot Bread, Wurzelbrot (Swiss Twisted Bread), Wisconsin beer cheese bread, and some much-needed gluten-free loaves such as sweet brioche and fruit-and-nut spiral rolls. The new step-by-step photos for many of the loaves are a huge help in properly shaping and assembling the more intricate loaves. For those looking for a caloric splurge, the book does sinful things with enriched doughs (the caramel pecan rolls are the best I've ever tried / made; I usually use the no-knead brioche dough as the base and double the topping / filling to make two pans; the chocolate raisin babka has 16 egg yolks). And like its predecessor, you'll find dishes that pair well with various breads, including a Portuguese fish stew, Tuscan white bean dip, kebabs, and a chilled Moroccan-style gazpacho.<br /><br />If you're new to breadmaking, I would definitely recommend upgrading to the New Artisan Bread in Five, but if you've been a longtime baker from the first edition and are already comfortable with the basic doughs and instructions, you may want to look at one of their other books like [[ASIN:0312649940 Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day]].",Positive
"I've  long used Joan Nathan's Holiday [[ASIN:0805211179 The Jewish Holiday Baker]] and Marcy Goldman's [[ASIN:1770500030 A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking]] as my standbys in years past, and was very excited to see the upcoming Holiday Kosher Baker. My Polish grandmother was an excellent baker, and made many wonderful yeast breads and pastries, including cheese babkas, that I've been seeking to recapture.<br /><br />Beginning with the gorgeous cover photo with its embossed silver pomegranate edges, this is a beautiful cookbook that has pulled out all the stops. The six main sections, which represent the major Jewish holidays chronologically (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Chanukah, Purim, Passover and Shavuot), are color-coded, making it easy to quickly flip to a particular section. Beginning with a handy kosher baking encyclopedia that covers basic baking equipment and tips for cookies, cakes, tarts, mousses and pastries, you'll also find friendly advice on plating desserts, timing and planning holidays, and baking for Jewish lifecycle events.<br /><br />I instantly fell in love with several of the High Holiday desserts, including the elegant apple and honey challah rolls, whole-wheat chocolate babka, and the babka bites. I found the dough for the whole wheat chocolate babka easy to work with; you use a combination of white whole wheat and all-purpose flour. The babka bites are great for impromptu guests or events; the recipe makes about 48 and they freeze well. Also, because these are individually portioned in mini-muffin cups, they're also less messy than handing out slices of babka. Other recipes I tried and will definitely make part of my regular rotation are the almond and olive oil cake (parve), pignons (parve), and the cheese babka (dairy, obviously) that reminded me of my grandmother's babkas and cheese coffeecakes.<br /><br />The Passover section represents the bulk of the holiday recipes, with over 45 Passover recipes representing everything from cookies (biscotti, macarons, meringues) to candies, cupcakes and cakes (layer cake, strawberry Monaco, flourless chocolate amaretti cake), and tarts (the chocolate and pistachio tart and lemon tart with basil nut crust are my new favorites any time of  year!). Non-gebrokts recipes are clearly labeled, and a sidebar on common baking ingredients not available for Passover also help to simplify planning.<br /><br />In addition to favorites like babka, rugelach, (apple) latkes, and hamantaschen, you'll find a strong French influence throughout (Paula graduated from the Ritz Escoffier pastry school in Paris). Among the French-influenced offerings are brioche challah (dairy), tart tatin, madeleines, chestnut mousse, kouigh amann, pear and almond pithivier cake,  cannelés, éclairs, and a variety of macarons (lime, mocha, chocolate mousse).With the exception of the Shavuot recipes, the vast majority are parve (many rely on margarine; I've had good luck with Earth Balance Buttery Baking Sticks). I also loved the fact that the book addresses special diets: in addition to being kosher, there are vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and low-sugar recipes, truly something for everyone in your family and community.<br /><br />Recipes are given in volume and metric measurements. Along the way, you'll find helpful sidebars that explain techniques and tips for success. With the exception of some of the French recipes (and the several that call for passion fruit), most of the recipes call for commonplace equipment and ingredients that should be readily available in your area. At least one calls for [[ASIN:B008EA1SGI Voilà! Hallah Traditional Egg Bread Mix]], now available at Walmart. Recipes are also labeled by their level of difficulty (easy, moderate, or multiple step), and there are several that would be perfect for pint-sized helpers. Several of the more difficult recipes come with helpful step-by-step photos, and nearly every recipe features a color photo of the final baked good.<br /><br />""The Holiday Kosher Baker"" is a gorgeous cookbook that I will find myself using year-round; Paula is a fantastic ambassador for expanding kosher (particularly Passover) desserts to include mousse, fresh fruit, and French-inspired dairy-free desserts that prove that ""Passover desserts can be both flavorful and visually stunning.""<br /><br />(Review copy generously provided by Paula Shoyer and publicist)",Positive
"My grandmother's family immigrated from Poland in 1913, and though my grandmother was raised in the United States, she preserved certain Polish traditions at home. I grew up with homemade Polish dishes such as pierogi, golabki, barszcz bialy, and a variety of yeast breads and pastries with farmer's cheese, poppyseeds, and fruit. Unfortunately, babcia did not write down many of her Polish recipes.  Last year, I was looking for authentic Polish cookbooks that would capture some of her homestyle Polish cooking and stumbled upon the beautiful [[ASIN:0956699200 Rose Petal Jam: Recipes and Stories from a Summer in Poland]], so I was very excited to see that ""Sugared Orange"" was coming out.<br /><br />""Sugared Orange: Recipes and Stories from a Winter in Poland,"" is the second in a series of four books chronicling the rhythm (and flavors) of the seasons in Poland. The first volume, ""Rose Petal Jam,""  traced Beata Zatorska's  childhood memories and flavors of a Polish summer across different cities including Warsaw, Poznan, Torun,  and Zamosc (a town near my family's ancestral city) via her grandmother's recipes.<br /><br />In ""Sugared Orange,"" we are taken on a journey to Lublin, Warsaw, Krakow, and Lodz, treated to the many scenes of a Polish winter, and invited to participate in winter holidays like St. Nicholas' Day, Christmas Eve (Wigilia), and New Year's. For a young Beata, hard-to-get oranges represented Christmas as well as a taste of the exotic; Beata's grandmother used to make sugared orange peel every winter and ""the perfume of orange peel infused my brain with dreams of tropical lands, orange trees, and exotic adventures for when I grew up."" Beautiful reproduction advertising centering around oranges (and the color orange) is sprinkled throughout. Many orange-infused recipes are featured prominently, including a light, delicate sugared orange cake, a Polish cheesecake studded with sugared orange peel and raisins, orange ice cream, orange shortbread tart and poppyseed pancakes with orange. As candied orange peel can be difficult to locate in the United States, a basic sugared orange peel recipe makes a convenient starting point for many of the later recipes in the book.<br /><br /> ""Sugared Orange"" features many familiar dishes that my babcia used to make, including Christmas Eve sauerkraut with split peas, grated beets with horseradish, stuffed cabbage, and sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi. I also discovered some new favorites such as piernik (gingerbread cake), a loaf rich with spices, chopped candied ginger, and chocolate. Another new find was the savory buns with cabbage and mushrooms (kapusniaki); yeast dough surrounds a filling of sautéed onions, mushrooms (I used cremini), and sauerkraut. The directions were straightforward and easy to follow; I would recommend letting the rolls rise for at least 45 minutes to an hour on the second rise (the recipe specifies 15 minutes). They freeze very well and make a great snack or side for soup or salad. I also loved the Lublin barley cake (kaszak lubelski) -  the mild flavor of barley, farmer's cheese and orange peel reminded me of an Italian ricotta Easter pie.<br /><br />Ingredients are listed in American measurements and metric; I used the metric measurements when I tested recipes. Patriotic red and white ribbons make it easy to quickly bookmark your favorite recipes. The alphabetical (Polish) list of recipes is somewhat easier to use (and faster) than looking up ingredients in the index: for example, you won't find a listing for cabbage or sauerkraut in the index, though the book includes several recipes featuring them.<br /><br />Beautiful photographs by Simon Target of Polish cities, Christmas markets, various foods and ingredients are interspersed with vintage Polish Christmas cards, advertising, paintings, and bilingual poems and carols that form a time capsule of a bygone Poland.  Many of Beata's family photographs and stories resonated with me, such as the photo of her grandparents' evacuation orders (I still have copies of my great-grandparents' passports in Russian, as they lived near the border of present-day Ukraine). I know very little of my grandmother's early years in Poland; by reading Beata's stories and looking at the beautiful winter photographs, I could imagine my young grandmother playing in the snowy Polish countryside and running inside for a quick warmup of sauerkraut-filled rolls as Beata herself used to.<br /><br />Part living history, part cookbook, ""Sugared Orange"" is a beautifully crafted tribute to Poland's traditional hearty cuisine and its winter holidays, regional traditions, and sometimes tumultuous history. Poland's once-thriving Jewish population is touched upon; you'll find a recipe and photo for a four-strand challah and photographs of a beautiful Baroque synagogue saved during WWII. Beata's family history and reminiscences of growing up in Poland (she moved to Australia at 19) give context to the many recipes and traditions, and reading (and cooking from) ""Sugared Orange"" is like sipping a cup of tea in a cozy kitchen as you watch the snow fall outside.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Tabula Books)",Positive
"I read Ann Mah's ""Mastering the Art of French Eating"" on the heels of [[ASIN:0062088068 The Perfect Meal: In Search of the Lost Tastes of France]] and [[ASIN:1605984418 Coquilles, Calva and Crème: Exploring France's Culinary Heritage: A Love Affair wtih Real French Food]]; I spent three weeks touring France last fall, so was a bit nostalgic for the various flavors I encountered from south to north as I made my way from Toulouse through the Perigord Noir, the Loire Valley, Normandy and finally Paris. Mah's husband, a diplomat, lands a plum assignment to Paris: three years together to explore the city and its many boulangeries, cafes, and markets. An aspiring food writer, Ann is thrilled with the possibilities. They find an apartment and unpack the many boxes that have lived for years in storage (due to her husband's assignments, they have moved around frequently). But the unthinkable happens: her husband is called away to Iraq on a one-year unaccompanied tour, leaving Ann to navigate an unfamiliar language and city.<br /><br />During her year on her own, she traces the origin of various French specialties by heading straight for the source: AAAAA andouillette in Troyes, crepes in Brittany, cassoulet in Toulouse, pistou in Provence, boeuf Bourguignon in Burgundy. Beautifully written and with touches of humor, each chapter concludes with the star recipe that it focuses on. And yes, you'll find healthy sprinklings of wisdom from Julia throughout. There are fascinating cultural tidbits (and lots of dashes of local customs and lore) that serve to spice up the individual stories and portraits of individual regions. And much like a long-simmered cassoulet, all of these elements form a delicious whole.",Positive
"Bev Shaffer's ""Chocolate Desserts to Die For!"" (the fourth book in her ""To Die For!"" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br /><br />The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (""Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones""), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de crème, white chocolate coeur a la crème with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br /><br />I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de crème. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br /><br />The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br /><br />Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the ""food of the gods;"" chocoholics rejoice!<br /><br />(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",Positive
"Lisa Stander-Horel and Tim Horel's ""Nosh on This"" (an update of last year's self-published ""Gluten Free Canteen's Book of Nosh: Baking for Jewish Holidays & More"") is a veritable treasure trove of delicious Jewish-American baked goods like mandelbrot, hamantashen, rugelach, babka, and macaroons rounded out with cupcakes (pumpkin with honey buttercream, dark chocolate cinnamon, cherry chocolate, coconut), donuts, fluffy layer cakes, Danish, éclairs, and Austrian-inspired gems like Sachertorte and Linzer torte. You'll also find several variations of challah and baked savories like kugels, hand pies, latkes, and quiche, as well as homemade confections (peanut butter cups, marshmallows, truffles, and the sinfully delicious coconut matzo rocky road). In addition to being gluten-free, many recipes are dairy-free as well, very handy for those keeping kosher as well as those who are allergic to dairy as well as gluten.<br /><br />I had eagerly awaited this book as soon as I heard it was coming out; in preparation for marathon baking, I stocked up on white and brown rice flour and tapioca starch. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate any local stores selling the recommended Authentic Foods superfine white and brown rice flours and it would have cost me close to $40 to order them online, so I ended up using Bob's Red Mill GF flours. Unlike some GF cookbooks, ""Nosh on This"" does not use any premixed all-purpose mixes containing starches or stabilizers; the base Nosh flour recipe consists of brown and white rice flours and tapioca starch in a 2-1-1 ratio (given by weight and also volume). Most of the Nosh recipes are (xanthan/guar) gum-free as well; several (particularly the bread recipes) call for Expandex Modified Tapioca Starch to help create the ""nice bendy tear"" in traditional breads. Many recipes also layer flavor by combining various extracts (vanilla, orange, almond, lemon). In Lisa's words, ""Baking gluten-free doesn't have to be taste-free or texture-challenged and whenever possible, use chocolate.""<br /><br />I loved the foreword by Arthur Schwartz (his [[ASIN:1580088988 Arthur Schwartz's Jewish Home Cooking: Yiddish Recipes Revisited]] is a staple in my kitchen) and reading about Lisa's family (""Oy gevalt - you're so skinny. Nosh something. No one ever died eating two desserts. Nosh on this!"") and the vintage family photos sprinkled throughout. Each chapter kicks off with handy tips and tricks, and each recipe has a chatty intro that's like sitting down with a cup of coffee and a good friend. There's a great Jewish holiday baking chart that lists all the recipes alphabetically along with which Jewish holidays they are suited for. The font is easy to read, and I liked that recipe substitutions were printed in a lighter font (although it was a tad hard for me to read as it was light grey; light blue or a different color might have been easier to read from a cookbook holder). Instructions are clear, and there are gorgeous color photos for each recipe.<br /><br />So far I've tried three recipes (Mom's double chocolate gelt, marzipany gooey brownies, and chocolate chunk cherry brownies) and have many more bookmarked (flourless chocolate orange cookies, I'm looking at YOU). I love to bake, but am fairly new to gluten-free baking, so I stuck to familiar territory (baked goods rather than breads; the bread recipes are more complicated than traditional yeast breads as the dough is more fragile and requires careful handling). I'm a chocoholic, and LOVED the double chocolate gelt (next time, I would consider forming the dough into a log, chilling it, rolling it in coarse sugar and slicing it vs. making individual rounds). The brownies were fabulous, especially the marzipan brownies. My only prior experience with GF brownies was from a box mix, and I found it sadly lacking. But these are infused with almondy goodness with the added bonus of mini chocolate chips studded throughout the batter. The macaroons (unlike the recent [[ASIN:1118472160 The Macaroon Bible]] I reviewed as part of Amazon Vine) are conveniently dairy-free (and thus healthier and lighter than using sweetened condensed milk as a binder). One of these days I will work up the nerve to attempt the chocolate babka (the recipe calls for 28 ingredients and spans two pages)!<br /><br />This is one of those rare cookbooks where I actually want to make EVERYTHING (usually I count myself lucky if I tag a handful of recipes out of any given cookbook). You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this cookbook; this should be in every baker's kitchen (especially if you are new to a gluten-free diet; this is SO much better than premade GF frozen baked goods or GF boxed mixes!) ""Nosh on This"" is perfect for those new to (gluten-free) baking; there are plenty of tips, a ""411"" on frequently-used ingredients, a handy locator list for equipment, ingredients and information, celiac and Jewish baking resources, and the aforementioned Jewish holiday baking chart. This is a blessing for those who are celiac or gluten-intolerant (I count myself in the latter category), or even if you're an experienced (non-GF) baker looking for a challenge and some new, delicious recipes to add to your baking repertoire (I'm eager to try the apple upside-down cake with honey pomegranate syrup for fall). Thank you Lisa Stander-Horel and Tim Horel (and their blog Gluten-Free Canteen) for making the delicious Jewish-American treats of our childhoods accessible once again!",Positive
"I've had the honor of teaching numerous Iraqi students over the last several years, and they were always eager to share their culture and food with me. I was interested in learning more about Iraqi cuisine, so I was overjoyed to finally receive my copy of the beautiful second edition of Delights from the Garden of Eden. This new edition, which has been several years in the making, features over 300 color photos, the historical and cultural material got a considerable make-over and updates, and measurements are now listed in metric as well as Imperial so readers worldwide can savor the joys of Iraqi cuisine.<br /><br />This beautiful tome is part textbook, part cookbook and covers Iraqi cuisine from the Mesopotamian diet to early Babylonian recipes, cookbooks of the Abbasid Era, and modern interpretations, lavishly illustrated throughout with a combination of calligraphy, manuscripts, photographs, and sketches and paintings by modern Iraqi artists that illustrate every aspect of Iraqi food and its preparation.<br /><br />The first 70+ pages are devoted to illuminating the ancient foodways from which modern Iraqi cuisine descends. In each chapter, there are poems, quotes, and street vendor songs reflecting the importance of various staples in everyday life.<br /><br />Beginning most appropriately with bread, in addition to a basic recipe (and variations) for Iraqi flatbread, you'll find sammoun, Arabic bread (pita), lawash, filled pastries, sweet yeast bread and other delights. There is a whole chapter devoted to vegetarian appetizers and salads, which include familiar staples such as hummus, baba ghannouj, and tabboula alongside Iraqi omelets and flavorful salads (the spicy orange juice salad dressing has become my new standby!), among them a wonderful beet salad dressed with walnuts and yogurt. Many of the recipes are a little lighter and more health-conscious than their original versions (you'll still find plenty of fried recipes if you are so inclined). For the more adventurous, you will find dishes like pacha (head, tripe and trotters), bastirma (stuffed intestines), and beef tongue sandwich.<br /><br />I loved the baked French beans, which are blanched then cooked in a savory custard topped with cheeses and breadcrumbs. These seemingly simple ingredients blossomed when combined to create a delicious savory side dish (or snack). My only recommendation is to use a larger baking dish than called for; the recipe calls for an 8 x 6 inch dish, but the included photo uses a 9 x 13 casserole (I used my [[ASIN:B000JCMPH0 Emile Henry 10-1/2-Inch Oval Au Gratin Azure Blue]] and it was a perfect fit).<br /><br />In the rice chapter, the green rice with fresh fava beans and rice with mung beans made wonderful vegetarian main courses. The chapter on stuffed foods yielded delicate dolmas and kubba, while the port city of Basra offers several excellent shrimp recipes (and I can't wait to try the sweet and sour fish simmered in almond prune sauce!).<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the chapters on savory pastries and desserts, and tried making the olive and cheese bread (pita), apricot balls and lawzeena (almond candy). The olive and cheese bread was a moist, springy dough enriched with yogurt and olive oil and studded with olives, mint, and parsley, making for addictive snacking. The herbs stayed a vibrant green even after being baked into the pita, which makes for a beautiful presentation when sliced into bars as suggested. The apricot balls take only moments to throw together in a food processor, but be sure to use sweetened coconut (snip with kitchen scissors or pulse in the food processor before adding the apricots). My testers said that using unsweetened desiccated coconut, while having the same appearance, resulted in the rosewater being overpowering rather than balancing out the sugar in the coconut.<br /><br />For the almond candy, I tried using both domestic canned almond paste ([[ASIN:B004V7MH1S Solo Almond Paste 8oz]]) and imported almond paste in a tube ([[ASIN:B000DINENE Odense Almond Paste]]). I found that even with kneading, the canned almond paste was too dry and brittle and cracked, allowing the filling to leak out. I had much better luck on my second attempt with the almond paste in a tube, although note that it is 7 oz. instead of 8 oz., so you will want to make a smaller rectangle. Also, make sure that your dough for the almond candy is at least ¼"" thick; the first time I tried to bake this, I rolled it too thinly and the filling punched through and leaked all over the pan! (and the pistachio - confectioner's sugar- rosewater filling makes an addictive candy on its own rolled into balls and chilled!)<br /><br />The recipes have been modified somewhat to fit Western home kitchens; ingredients are given in  Imperial and metric measurements, and some substitutions (particularly for cheese) have been made. I wrote the author about the choices of cheeses recommended in the recipes (including mozzarella and cheddar), and she kindly wrote back with the following: ""Regarding Iraqi cheeses, as I mention in my chapter on dairy products, we have three major cheeses...In my recipes I use feta because it is the closest and most available in the US general stores. However, you might find these days some white Mexican cheeses which might also be used, or if you have access to Middle Eastern stores, you can use Halloom cheese or Akkawi. In my recipes I try to use what's most easily available without compromising authenticity as much as possible.""<br /><br />As with any international cookbook, you will be making or using many different spice blends, including baharat and za'tar. Recipes for the spice blends are given in the glossary. Some recipes also call for noomi Basra (dried lime), amba (pickled mango), and tamarind.<br /><br />There is a very thorough list of scholarly works cited, and not one but several indices as well as a name and subject index. The book itself is very high quality, with heavy matte paper, beautiful photography, and a teal blue ribbon to hold your place. At well over 500 pages, it is a large volume, but lays flat neatly, making it easy to cook from any section. You'll also find a wide variety of sample menus for various occasions, including seasonal menus (among them an Iftar menu for Ramadan), ladies' tea parties, and mezze.<br /><br />""Delights from the Garden of Eden"" is truly a journey; you'll learn about table manners, dining protocol, how the etymology of Arabic food words can be traced back to their earlier roots, the culinary riches and ingenious recipes of medieval Iraqi cooks, and how ancient Mesopotamian customs can be traced to the present. It is a labor of love that illuminates the deep connections between food and culture, past and present, and above all, shows us how much we have in common.  Highly recommended; this should be in every cookbook collection if you are interested in Middle Eastern cuisine! If you already own the original first edition, it is WELL worth purchasing the updated and revised second edition.<br /><br />(Uploaded images for this review can be viewed here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/1845534573/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_all)<br /><br />(Many thanks to author Nawal Nasrallah for answering my questions and Equinox for the review copy!)",Positive
"I had the good fortune to spend six months in Central Japan in 2010-2011; during my stay, I took four Japanese cooking classes in three different cities focusing on traditional cooking methods and regional specialties, including a class led by Elizabeth Andoh (author of [[ASIN:1580085199 Washoku: Recipes from the Japanese Home Kitchen]] and [[ASIN:1580089550 Kansha: Celebrating Japan's Vegan and Vegetarian Traditions]]). The act of making and preparing food according to tradition (including the concept of kansha, or appreciation) was a deeply spiritual journey for me.<br /><br />I contacted Nancy Singleton Hachisu through her blog, and she was kind enough to send a review copy of Japanese Farm Food. When I opened it, it was an instant homecoming for me. Memories of prowling the morning markets at Takayama, admiring the kaleidoscope of pickles at Nishiki Market in Kyoto, or learning about the many varieties of sansai (wild mountain vegetables) at an Osaka department store food hall came rushing back.<br /><br />After a compact look at Japanese farmhouse pantry staples and tools and a handy three-page visual dictionary of cutting and cooking techniques, you'll find the Japanese equivalent of munchies: tsumami. These are simple preparations that showcase the freshness of the ingredients, like ikura (salmon roe),  edamame, eggs pickled in soy sauce, fried fish and Okinawan staple goya champuru (stir-fried bitter melon with egg and red pepper). The pecan miso was an absolute revelation; I used [[ASIN:B0019LA7OI SOUTH RIVER ORGANIC 3-YR BARLEY MISO 1 LB]], and the depth of the flavors was superb. The oil from the pecans (ground to a paste) complemented the salty umami hit from the barley miso and would be great as a dip for raw veggies. The soy sauce eggs make a great snack; these are traditional in homemade bento boxes.<br /><br />One of the great pleasures of any Japanese market or department store food hall is browsing the huge assortment of pickles on display. I loved the section on tsukemono (pickles); these are an essential part of Japanese cuisine. There are several main pickling methods used, including massaging with salt, rice bran (nukazuke), or pickling in vinegar. Here you'll find smashed cucumber pickles with garlic, sweet-vinegared daikon and carrots, young ginger pickled in plum vinegar, and zucchini pickled in rice bran (additional pickle recipes can be found throughout the book). There is an extremely useful guide to vegetables by method at the very back that covers most of the common Japanese cooking/pickling methods.<br /><br />Tofu and eggs get their own chapter; there's a straightforward recipe for homemade tofu and several excellent egg dishes including the traditional rolled omelette, egg custard squares with crab and spinach, and egg custard with flowering mustard in sour orange halves. I loved the idea of steaming chawanmushi in an orange shell instead of the traditional chawanmushi pots; it makes for a beautiful presentation, and the slight hint of citrus in the custard is a welcome addition. (For an excellent and easy primer on making your own soymilk and yuba, I recommend [[ASIN:1580089550 Kansha: Celebrating Japan's Vegan and Vegetarian Traditions]].)<br /><br />Comfort foods also make an appearance, including miso-broiled fish, teriyaki, deep-fried ginger chicken, gyudon and yakiniku. There's a primer on homemade udon and ramen, simple sushi and onigiri preparations, and many vegetarian options (the chapter on vegetables offers nearly *thirty* varieties of salads, tempura, stir fries and simmered veggies). Handy tips and sidebars offer additional suggestions and variations. Various staple recipes such as Japanese mustard, Japanese mayonnaise, dashi, ponzu, and several excellent vinaigrettes and dressings are worth the cost of the book alone (walnut-miso, sesame-miso, tofu-miso, etc.).<br /><br />Along the way, the author frequently reminisces about individual dishes or ingredients, her multicultural family, her encounters with local Japanese farmers and traditional methods, and descriptions of local festivals and disappearing food traditions that read like talking to an old friend.<br /><br />The graphic design also deserves a special mention; ai-zome (indigo textiles) are a visual theme throughout the book, including the beautiful fabric binding. The photos are stunning as well; there are gorgeous glimpses into Japanese gardens, local farmers hard at work in their fields and orchards, scenes of rural festivals and rice pounding, traditional kitchen tools, and closeups of farm-fresh produce as well as finished dishes. Unlike many cookbooks these days, the pages are matte, so glare/slippery pages is not an issue.<br /><br />If I had to sum up Japanese Farm Food in two words, they would be ""simple"" and ""fresh."" Inside these pages are dozens of simple, tasty ways to prepare seasonal produce; most recipes include only a handful of ingredients and take mere moments to prepare, but the depth of flavor that is achieved (aided by umami in the form of miso and/or soy sauce) is nothing short of amazing. And one of the best parts is that the author calls for far fewer hard-to-find  Japanese ingredients than many other Japanese homestyle cookbooks; this makes a huge difference for items that are not easily substituted (especially fresh vegetables / herbs). This is an absolutely gorgeous cookbook that nourishes the spirit as well as the body.<br /><br />(Arigatou gozaimasu to Nancy Singleton Hachisu and her publicist for the review copy!)",Positive
"I read the first [[ASIN:030745469X Bruno, Chief of Police: A Novel of the French Countryside]] before a trip to P&eacute;rigord last year, and fell in love with the village of St. Denis, the countryside, the regional gourmet delights, and most of all Bruno himself, a military vet scarred by his time in Bosnia who always has time for a handshake or to hear out a villager's problem.<br /><br />I have not read the other three novels that preceded the Devil's Cave, so I have obviously missed some important backstory from [[ASIN:0307744647 The Crowded Grave: A Mystery of the French Countryside (Vintage)]]) that is referenced throughout the novel, but the rest of the plot was easy enough to follow.<br /><br />A dead woman floating down the river causes quite a stir...not just the fact that she was naked, but that it appeared there were Satanic elements involved in her death. Several of the villagers find this makes for a healthy boost in tourism...much to the chagrin of the mayor, who decidely doesn't want St. Denis known for Satanic rituals. Add in that there is a huge development deal on the table for the village, a hotel compound frequented by defense ministry officials, a mysterious Communist countess, and many other elements that are eventually woven together (some more loosely than others), and it can be quite confusing at times to keep track of it all. Bruno must also deal with some personal drama...his two love interests, the ""mad Englishwoman"" Pamela and the recently wounded policewoman Isabelle, both have commitment issues.<br /><br />The caves of P&eacute;rigord play a starring role here (and this theme is not new to Walker, as evidenced by his earlier [[ASIN:1439181233 The Caves of Perigord: A Novel]]. The countryside of St. Denis is beautiful as usual, but there is so much going on here that there is not much time to leisurely enjoy the town's market days as in [[ASIN:030745469X Bruno, Chief of Police: A Novel of the French Countryside]]. I found the novel's climax to drag on a bit and to test the limits of plausibility. Also, some of the subplots seemed forced and unnecessary and only served to clutter the novel further.<br /><br />Despite these few missteps, I still enjoyed reading of Bruno's adventures and of the reappearance from one of his colleagues from Sarajevo, not to mention the appearance of a new character who quickly stole my heart.",Positive
"Packed with symbolism, Operation Oleander is a riveting read and one that doesn't sugarcoat the realities of deployment and its impact on soldiers, their families, and communities.<br /><br />I'd ordered Operation Oleander just as the recent news story broke a suicide bomber attacking a convoy of US soldiers, diplomats, and DoS civilians who were delivering books to a school in Afghanistan. In Operation  Oleander, Jess Westmark and her friend Meriwether Scott, both of whom have parents deployed to Afghanistan, start a charity to collect money and school supplies for a Kabul orphanage. Their parents and others from their unit are directly involved in delivering donated supplies to the orphanage. But things go horribly wrong when the soldiers' convoy is bombed, killing and wounding several Fort Spencer soldiers and Afghan civilians. Meriwether's mom is killed and Jess's father is seriously wounded in the attack. Suddenly Jess and her Operation Oleander are under fire; did her charity needlessly jeopardize the lives of American soldiers?<br /><br />I found that Jess's narrative really rang true for me; after her mother flies to Germany, she tries to mend her relationship with Meriwether and to soul search about the future of Operation Oleander; she's received a direct order to stand down by the post's commander. She tries to emulate her father in times of crisis: ""Straighten up. Stay calm. Keep order."" Duty, honor, country. Jess has to learn to make her own way and do what she feels is right.<br /><br />The novel introduces many elements of military life: deployment, the PX, base housing, military customs and courtesies, etc. It's great to see these things mentioned in a YA book when there are more than 1 million military kids living this reality every day. Most bases and posts offer some kind of ""deployment camps"" or support groups for younger kids, but for teenagers already going through a lot of changes (the constant reassignment to other posts / bases / schools, not to mention the stress of having a family member deployed, sometimes for several consecutive tours), Operation Oleander may be of some comfort to have a narrator in the same situation.",Positive
"I own both of Michele's [[ASIN:054700303X The Italian Slow Cooker]] and [[ASIN:0547508042 The French Slow Cooker]] books, and they are in frequent rotation in my [[ASIN:B0026A7GRM Hamilton Beach Premiere Cookware 5-1/2-Quart Slow Cooker]] for their winning combination of authentic flavors and relatively easy prep.<br /><br />I preordered her latest, Mediterranean Slow Cooker, and quickly bookmarked several recipes that caught my eye. In the French Slow Cooker, Michele demystified soufflés for the slow cooker. Here, you'll find a variety of egg dishes like spinach and feta omelet, spicy vegetable eggah, Israeli breakfast favorite shakshouka, and a delicate green bean and scallion torta that would all make fantastic brunch options.<br /><br />The poached salmon in court-bouillon was a winner, especially when paired with the suggested tzatziki, and the shrimp with tomatoes and feta (my personal preference was to switch out the white wine in the sauce for red) was also a favorite. The crunchy mustard chicken diable has the ingenious solution of slow-cooking bone-in chicken thighs, then toasting panko on the stove and coating the chicken at the last minute so the topping remains crunchy (this would make a great picnic dish!). And the pork ragu with broken lasagna Maialino-style was an unexpected gem; the simple sauce is served over irregular sheets of lasagna noodles tossed with Parmigiano and arugula. Fans of lamb will find plenty to rejoice over, including numerous Greek recipes like Bandits' Lamb (stuffed with salty Greek cheese) and Middle Eastern lamb and pine nut meatballs.<br /><br />Vegetarians will also find some offerings, such as red lentil soup, winter squash and chickpea soup, polenta with herbs, wheat berry tabbouleh, bulgur and toasted walnut pilaf, and farro with spring vegetables. Like her other slow cooker cookbooks, you'll also find ""out of the pot"" recipes that use precooked beans, etc.; here these offerings include a Greek country chickpea salad, hummus, and Turkish beet and goat cheese dip.<br /><br />For me, the real star of the book was the desserts. The entire section is crammed full of intriguing finds, like several Greek-inspired cakes (sunny orange cake with orange syrup, walnut cake with cinnamon syrup), decadent cheesecakes (the first recipe I tried was the awesome cannoli cheesecake; see above for a photo) including Nutella, several flans, bread puddings, and fruit (blushing pomegranate pears, warm fruit compote with mascarpone sauce).<br /><br />This is a worthy investment if you enjoy Italian, Spanish, and Greek food, and most of the ingredients should be easy to find at your local supermarket. Yes, there is some prep involved in the chopping and sautéing of veggies (and browning of meat) before cooking, but this adds a wealth of flavor to the final dish that is well worth the extra time (and if you have a slow cooker with a metal insert, you can sauté and cook in the same dish). The desserts alone are worth the cost of the book; Michele taught me that I can make showstopping cheesecakes in my slow cooker, a trick I never would have thought to try on my own! (I used [[ASIN:B000237FS0 Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch]] set on a [[ASIN:B005FPD6VA Spice Ratchet 16812 Blossom Multi-Use Silicone Trivet, Black]]).<br /><br />**Update 1/20: In addition to the cannoli cheesecake, I've also made the sunny orange cake with orange syrup (which is basically a revani or basbousa, in this case lightened by folding in whipped egg whites), coffee flan, and the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake (see photos above). Maybe it's just my particular slow cooker, but I found that my cakes baked much more quickly than the suggested times, so check at least 30 minutes before the book times to play it safe.<br /><br />***Update 5/26: I have also tried the roasted beets and beet and goat cheese dip, basic recipe for chickpeas and the country chickpea salad and hummus, and next up is the coconut flan (everybody RAVES about the coffee caramel flan, so I wanted to try the variation!). I have enjoyed every dish I've tried from the Mediterranean Slow Cooker!",Positive
"My city just got our first Trader Joe's last November, and I've been looking for easy, tasty ways to use the many intriguing finds I'd brought home (masala simmer sauce, mango ginger chutney, spice blends, frozen veggies, etc.). As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see that Cooking with Trader Joe's Cookbook: Vegetarian was coming out.<br /><br />This cookbook is compiled from the other cookbooks in the series, including [[ASIN:0979938481 Cooking With All Things Trader Joe's Cookbook]], [[ASIN:0979938430 Cooking With Trader Joe's Cookbook: Dinner's Done!]] and [[ASIN:0979938465 Cooking With Trader Joe's Cookbook: Lighten Up!]]. You'll see many familiar recipes, particularly from the first Cooking with All Things Trader Joe's cookbook, but this is well worth adding to your collection, particularly for vegetarians as all the recipes are in one place (the one recipe I was looking for but missed was the Perfectly Peared Gorgonzola Quesadillas from [[ASIN:0979938481 Cooking With All Things Trader Joe's Cookbook]], which were absent).<br /><br />The book is a high-quality hardcover, with heavy, glossy pages that stand up well to frequent use.  Chapters are arranged by appetizers, soups and salads, main meals, sides, desserts and drinks, and breakfast. Each recipe features a full-color photo, and you'll also find plenty of whimsical illustrations and photos of ingredients throughout. There are green ""tip"" sidebars with helpful suggestions, and you'll also find useful info in the recipe intros themselves. Each recipe contains detailed nutritional info (calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber, sugar, sodium), prep time, hands-off cooking time, number of servings and serving size, which makes this a great tool for those looking to count calories, fat, sugar, etc. Most of my dozens of vegetarian cookbooks are lacking nutritional info, so I was especially grateful to see it here. Recipes that are (or can be made) gluten-free are marked with a red G (the authors also recently released [[ASIN:1938706021 Cooking With Trader Joe's Cookbook: Gluten-Free]]).<br /><br />I tried several of the recipes over the last few weeks, starting with the olive-stuffed bread, chocolate coffee fudge, lemon-basil cake, and the cheese and chutney mini-rolls. I used TJ's refrigerated herb pizza dough and their black olive tapenade for the olive bread, and the resulting loaf had a fabulous flavor and texture. The next time I make it, I would consider making individual rolls; it would be a little less messy for serving a crowd (and you could freeze the rolls and reheat them one at a time).<br /><br />The cheese and chutney mini-rolls made a great appetizer! The recipe recommends using aged sharp cheddar or cave-aged gruyere, but my new favorite find at TJ's is the Cinnamon Toscano, which marries beautifully with the mango and ginger in the chutney. This would also be good served as an open-faced sandwich / crostini, if a little messy!<br /><br />The chocolate coffee fudge was a great twist on a classic recipe; the boost of espresso really enhanced the chocolate, and the fudge stayed fresh and creamy in an airtight container for several days.<br /><br />The lemon-basil cake was a revelation; despite containing ½ cup of finely chopped basil (time to break out those chiffonade skills), the basil adds a subtle complement to the lemon zest. The one addition I made was brushing on a lemon syrup made from 1/3 cup water and ¼ cup sugar brought to a boil, then add the juice of two lemons off the heat and let cool. This way, you end up using all of the lemons; the recipe calls for the zest of two lemons, and if you make the lemon syrup/glaze, there's no waste (plus, the syrup helps the cake to stay moist). The next time I make this, I'm going to bake it in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] for added visual appeal! This would be perfect as a teatime or brunch offering.<br /><br />All of the recipes I tried were tasty and came together quickly. I've bookmarked several others that I want to try in the near future, including the Indian spinach pizza, quiche, balsamic roasted fennel, anytime Mediterranean pasta (the ultimate pantry staple dinner!), and pasta alla checca.<br /><br />Cooking With Trader Joe's Cookbook: Vegetarian is a cookbook I'll find myself coming back to frequently for its combination of interesting recipes (lots of international influences from India, Asia, Mexico, Italy, etc.), quick prep times, nutritional info, and most importantly, tasty results!<br /><br />(A huge thank you to authors Deana Gunn and Wona Minati for the autographed review copy!)",Positive
"I first heard of Robin Robertson from her yuba-wrapped vegetarian haggis in [[ASIN:1558322566 Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker: 200 Recipes for Healthy and Hearty One-Pot Meals That Are Ready When You Are]]. Now Robin has released a slow-cooker book catering to vegans, but you certainly don't have to be vegan (or even vegetarian!) to enjoy it. You'll find many surprising and tasty international influences within, like Vietnamese pho, three-bean cholent, Moroccan tempeh and chickpeas with prunes and apricots, French cassoulets, Greek beans, Latin updates (chimichurri spaghetti squash, layered tamale pie, seitan ropa vieja) and even a touch of soul food.<br /><br />If you're new to slow cookers, you'll find a handy chapter on slow cooker basics, including crockery care caveats (say that three times fast!), slow cooker points and pointers, tips for slow-cooking success, timing factors, and an in-depth look at ingredients (beans, packaged meat alternatives, vegan thickeners, etc.). Recipes are labeled whether there is a gluten- and/or soy-free option; however, no nutritional info is provided.<br /><br />Like her previous slow-cooker book (and those by other authors like Michele Scicolone), you will find many recipes that recommend sauteeing veggies and/or spices in a skillet before adding them to the slow cooker. Yes, this results in extra pots and pans and prep time, but it adds a whole other layer of flavor to the finished dish.<br /><br />I tried several dishes, including the layered tapenade potatoes, slow-cooker pho, and the pi&ntilde;a colada cake (which I baked up in muffin tins instead of cake form).<br /><br />*The layered tapenade potatoes had a great depth of flavor from the combination of the olives (I used kalamata instead of green), sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and capers; this would be good on its own as a dip. I like lots of crunchy topping, so I added extra toasted panko (the recipe only calls for 3 tablespoons).<br /><br />* The pho had a rich, spicy broth made with whole star anise and cloves (I used [[ASIN:B0006SYA3E Bouquet Garni Bags]] for easier removal). I also used a different kind of miso that I had on hand. This would make a great breakfast soup on its own without the rice noodles, much like miso is served in Japan.<br /><br />*Finally, I tried the pi&ntilde;a colada cake, which is rich with three types of coconut (shredded unsweetened, coconut extract, and cream of coconut), a splash of dark rum, and pineapple chunks and juice. These baked up super-moist, and I added additional shredded coconut after applying the glaze.<br /><br />One thing to note: the bean recipes call for precooked beans, either canned or homemade, so make sure you have some form of cooked beans on hand before starting the recipes. One of the few recipes that calls for dried beans is the three-bean cholent, which has a recommended cooking time of 8 to 11.5 hours or overnight.<br /><br />I've already bookmarked many other recipes to try (the ribollita is next on my list). I particularly liked the breakfast and dessert chapters, which feature cakes, bread pudding, and breads. The hot sangria from the hot drinks chapter will also be in frequent rotation, and you'll find plenty of appetizing nibbles to serve with the various punches (spiced rum punch, celebration punch, blushing spiced cider). There is sufficient variety and dishes to suit every taste to keep you happily coming back to Fresh from the Vegan Slow Cooker.",Positive
"The Professional Pastry Chef by Bo Friberg is a must-have reference for all serious bakers / pastry chefs. It appears frequently as part of baking / pastry arts curriculums for good reason: Chef Bo clearly explains techniques and plating suggestions with a healthy (and entertaining) dash of food science along the way. The first of two volumes (the second being [[ASIN:0471359262 The Advanced Professional Pastry Chef]]), this gorgeous (and hefty) tome walks the novice pastry chef through glazes, meringues, basic doughs (short dough, puff pastry, pate a choux, pasta), yeast breads, breakfast breads and pastries, quick breads / pound cakes, sponge cakes, decorated cakes, individual pastries, ice cream, and custard-type desserts. The section on plated desserts is worth the price of the book alone, as you'll find templates for pastry cutouts, piping instructions, etc.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is NOT a book for the average home baker. In most cases, the yields (and quantities, which are given in weights, not volume) are geared towards restaurants  / foodservice, although certain bread recipes are scaled down for smaller yields, such as the small-batch Black Forest bread with cocoa and dried cherries, challah, and Southwestern corn and cheese bread.<br /><br />The included line drawings are enormously helpful to illustrate techniques. The Chef's Tips and sidebars further explain techniques or recipe-specific advice. Several in-depth charts like cookie recipes categorized by texture, production method, and storage capability provide an at-a-glance guide to what would be an otherwise overwhelming number of recipes to juggle.<br /><br />The book particularly excels in its treatment of European (French/Italian/Viennese) pastries. Even the ice cream chapter yields unique flavor surprises, like the macadamia nut ice cream, banana-poppy seed ice cream, and avocado-mango ice cream. You'll find unusual frozen yogurts as well, like black-pepper honey, gingered pineapple, and strawberry-rhubarb frozen yogurt with ginger, that provide a welcome change.<br /><br />The comprehensive appendices cover nearly 150 pages alone, including an extremely thorough glossary of ingredients and tools, precise metric conversions and metric equivalents, metric/US length, weight, and volume equivalents,  and a particularly helpful section on yields, baker's percentages, and Baumé / Brix scale readings.<br /><br />Despite owning several dozen baking books, I find myself coming back time and again to ""The Professional Pastry Chef"" for its clear instructions, charts, and fascinating food science tidbits. Chef Bo makes for a most pleasant and patient instructor, and his thorough explanations of techniques and ingredients will serve you well whether you're an advanced home baker or an experienced pastry chef.<br /><br />(Many thanks to Wiley for the review copy)",Positive
"I discovered Debbie Macomber through her [[ASIN:0373892136 Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove Cookbook]], which was in our small local library in Central Japan. After returning home from six months with no kitchen (and having spent the previous Christmas overseas), I was thrilled to see her Christmas cookbook, and made numerous dishes from it for my first Christmas back home with family and friends, including the three-cheese scalloped potatoes and numerous sweets (triple ginger chocolate chunk cookies, almond joy to the world, cappuccino snickerdoodles with mocha glaze). The only real miss was the scalloped potatoes, which turned out far too watery. The recipe calls for 3 cups whole milk but no flour or other thickener, and the starch from the potatoes wasn't enough to hold it together (the milk is simply heated before being poured over the potatoes and baked).<br /><br />The recipes include traditional favorites alongside international additions like Spanish tortilla, green pea hummus, Provencal tomatoes, and tzatziki dip, so you can mix and match influences if you so desire. Tucked between the recipes you'll find cute, easy decorating ideas and crafts. If you could wrap up the sights, smells, and tastes of everything wonderful about holiday season, it would look a lot like this! ""Debbie Macomber's Christmas"" would make a wonderful gift for family and friends, and it's also a great cookbook to cook from together as a family (some of the simpler recipes would be appropriate for young kitchen helpers).",Positive
"I own several pie-centric cookbooks like [[ASIN:0764576348 Bubby's Homemade Pies]], so I was curious to see what new twists Not-So-Humble Pies would offer. Those updates start in the first chapter, with a pepper jack pastry crust, lemon and lavender short crust pastry, and a cream cheese pastry crust. You'll find new takes on cream, custard, and chiffon pies such as pomegranate cream cheese, cantaloupe cream, orange and dark chocolate cheese, roasted Hatch chilies, apple, and ricotta hand pies, and savory pies such as an apple, brie and bacon tart, lobster pie, and a French-inspired duck confit tart.<br /><br />Unexpected flavor elements like green tea, saffron, rose and wasabi turn up and add a flavor boost. For the more adventurous, you'll find ancho chile, pecan and chocolate toffee pie, habanero passion fruit pie, and strawberry jalapeno pie (many of the exotic pies in particular have a marked Latin influence).<br /><br />The book is surprisingly compact, yet each of its 150 recipes is clearly laid out with a smattering of photos throughout. The font could stand to be a bit larger, and I found the recipe prefaces in blue font to be a bit hard to read from a distance, but overall the layout is pleasing and easy to use.<br /><br />Beginning bakers may find the introduction too perfunctory to effectively coach; there are no illustrations and no glossary / guide to recommended equipment, but if you are already comfortable with the basics of making a pie crust and pie from scratch, you'll find much to enjoy in Not-So-Humble Pies if you're willing to experiment with new flavors and accents.",Positive
"""Inside the Jewish Bakery,"" written by two Jewish veteran bakers, lovingly captures a tantalizing slice of the vanished world of the heyday of Jewish bakeries in the United States. Sprinkled throughout are vintage black-and-white photos from Eastern Europe and 20th century Jewish bakeries in New York. The first section is appropriately titled ""Vanished Worlds,"" and briefly traces the history of Yiddish culture in Europe, setting the stage for the in-depth discussion of Yiddish baked goods to come (please note that the book focuses only on Ashkenazi breads and baked goods; if you're looking for Sephardic recipes, I highly recommend the Spanish-language [[ASIN:8427032374 Dulce lo vivas/ Live Sweet: La Reposteria Sefardi/ the Sefardi Bakery (Spanish Edition)]] or [[ASIN:0684870037 The World Of Jewish Desserts: More Than 400 Delectable Recipes from Jewish Communities]]).<br /><br />The first bread mentioned is perhaps the most symbolic: challah, that golden egg-enriched braided loaf served on Shabbat.  There are five challah recipes in addition to a step-by-step photo guide to challah shapes and braids. ""Jewish rye,"" or at least the mass-produced variety that most of us grew up on, bears little resemblance to the rye that was baked and eaten in Eastern European shtetls (""If challah was the queen of the Shabbes table, rye was the poor but honest yeoman who served during the other six days of the week""). The ""new"" rye breads made in the US featured finely milled rye flour and up to 80 percent wheat flour, whereas their Old Country cousins were about 55 percent rye flour for gebatlt broyt and about 95 percent rye flour for razeve broyt. ""Inside the Jewish Bakery"" offers several variants, starting with a rye sour culture, black bread, rustic pumpernickel, corn rye (kornbroyt), old-school Jewish Deli rye and mild deli rye. You'll also find potato bread, Vienna bread, bagels, pletsl, Kaiser rolls, and bialys.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the pastry offerings, as my Polish grandmother would frequently make yeast coffeecakes, poppy seed rolls, and other Old World desserts that were a pleasant counterpoint to the sickly-sweet supermarket confections that my classmates would bring for birthdays. The book truly shines in its description of the various short doughs, laminated doughs, and fillings, and there is an excellent ""Pastry Quick Reference Chart"" that's worth the price of the book if you're a frequent pastry baker. There are plenty of step-by-step illustrations and photos of techniques along the way, and a centerfold of color photographs submitted by what I assume are the book's test bakers.<br /><br />You'll find strudel, Danishes, bear claws, babka, yeast doughnuts, honey cake, sour cream coffee cake, and cheesecakes, along with a handy troubleshooting guide. Also included are old-fashioned comfort food cookies like rugelach, tayglech, mohn bars and kichelach. I tried the poppy seed cookies, which reminded me of the poppy seed rolls my grandmother used to make. The filling recipe was easy yet vastly superior to the usual Solo canned filling that my grandmother (and I) used, and I chose the sour cream short dough for the base, resulting in a tender, flaky pastry with a sweet, crunchy layer of poppy seeds and strudel. Patience is a virtue with many of these recipes, since the dough requires ample chilling time before use, but the wait is well worth it. The results were as delicious as any my babcia used to make, and a refreshing taste of a vanishing world.<br /><br />Measurements are given in volume, ounces and pounds, metric, and baker's percentages. At this point in time, I'm only giving the book four instead of five stars due to the numerous errata, many of which affect the bread dough recipes (at last count, there were six full pages of errata available as a PDF on the authors' website; see my comment below for the link), so be sure to print off the list and double-check before starting your recipe. Hopefully these errors will be corrected in a second edition. ""Inside the Jewish Bakery"" is obviously a labor of love, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in baking and pastry making, especially if you are interested in Yiddish culture.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Trina Kaye)",Positive
"""Jessica Rules the Dark Side"" picks up where [[ASIN:0547259409 Jessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark Side]] left off (sort of). In the interim between the two novels, author Beth Fantaskey posted online chapters detailing the preparations for Jessica's wedding to Lucius in Romania. Sadly, much of the romantic spark between Lucius and Jessica is absent in the sequel. Jessica is having difficulties adapting to her role as a vampire princess; she struggles with learning Romanian, can't communicate with the kitchen staff, and her parents are conveniently abroad in South America. A high-profile murder in the castle casts suspicion on Lucius, and Jessica is forced to take over in his absence. There are several narrators here in addition to Jessica and Lucius, so the POV switches rather frequently (sometimes jarringly).<br /><br />The original novel was snappy, witty, and engaging. Sadly, this is absent here. Jessica is almost a secondary character; instead, it's Mindy's turn to shine. Mindy's summer fling with Raniero (Lucius's cousin) has her moping her way through most of the book. Raniero makes a poor stand-in for Lucius, although we learn that his history is just as violent, if not more so. His pacifist Buddhist surfer-boy facade is just that, and when he lets it slip, it proves to have terrifying consequences. Granted, Mindy and Raniero do have chemistry, and they provide some comic relief, but the emphasis should have been on Jessica (the title *is* ""Jessica Rules the Dark Side,"" after all...). Instead, she engages in Bella-esque moping (see: [[ASIN:0316075655 New Moon (The Twilight Saga)]]) for much of the novel, feeling sorry for herself and her situation. She fears she's going crazy as she begins to have vivid hallucinations. By the time she finally gets her act together, it's pretty much the end of the book.<br /><br />My biggest issue with ""Jessica Rules the Dark Side"" was that I'd figured out the mystery (if not the villain(s), almost immediately, so it was frustrating to see several characters struggling with adding up two and two. And the missing ""chapters"" in preparation for Jessica's wedding add some insight; it would have been nice if they had been included, or at least the major points, as you feel like you're being dropped into the middle if you haven't read the chapters online.",Positive
"When I first saw [[ASIN:1558327495 The Bonne Femme Cookbook: Simple, Splendid Food That French Women Cook Every Day]] in my Vine newsletter, I was thinking it was somehow related to [[ASIN:0375710515 French Women Don't Get Fat]] (it's not). Much to my pleasant surprise, this charming cookbook is filled with the (simplified) pleasures of dining French-style, including a proper start with jaunty apéritifs and amuse-bouches like flaky green olive and cheese spirals, chutney-ham amuse-bouches, cognac julep, kir, and lemony pear sparkling sangria (there's even a handy guide to setting up your own apéritif dinatoîre). The recipes are a delightful blend of French and international influences, like the North African staples tabbouleh and couscous, or a Spanish-influenced salad with paprika, sherry vinegar, and Cabrales cheese, and many Italian-influenced dishes, like the amazing tagliatelle with blue cheese, walnuts and grapes.<br /><br />Along the way, sidebars contain stories about various aspects of French culture and cuisine from the author's experience as an exchange student and frequent visitor. Each recipe has a complete introduction as well that gives insight into its presentation (there are very useful tips for ordering in French restaurants, like the cheese trolley and dessert tray (hint: no, all those desserts are NOT for you!) and origins. The best part is that most recipes come together fairly quickly using common U.S. supermarket ingredients whenever possible. Sparse but charming illustrations round out the book (sorry, food photo lovers; there are no photographs of completed dishes in this volume!).<br /><br />I love that the recipes are low-maintenance. Consider the Zenlike simplicity of Any-Night Baked Rice: you saute garlic, add the rice to coat with butter, add stock, cover the pot and throw it into the oven for 15 minutes. The blending of classic French flavors is refreshing without being heavy, and captures the various regions of France, like the fingerling potatoes with walnuts and thyme from Périgord. Vegetarians will be pleased with the wide variety of grain-based and vegetable dishes that are complete meals in themselves. The best part is that these recipes can be completed in an hour or less in most cases. And the dishes are perfectly elegant: roast chicken breasts with goat cheese and trois oignons, roast pork with honey-cider vinegar sauce, a rolled French omelet with tapenade verte and sheep's milk cheese. The desserts also warrant special mention, including favorites like clafouti, tarte tatin, and madeleines (including lime pecan!) alongside walnut cake with cognac-brown butter frosting, apricot-pine-nut cakelettes, and a lemon curd crème brûlée that are the perfect sweet finish to your French meal.<br /><br />If you're interested in French cooking but you find Julia Child intimidating, this is the book for you. It perfectly captures the flavors and ambiance of France while making classic recipes accessible to a new generation of cooks with limited time (and access to French supermarkets!). Wini is a most engaging tour guide through the various facets of French cuisine and regional variations, and the recipes are clearly written and not intimidating at all. A list of U.S.-metric conversions for liquid and weight conversions and oven temperature is also provided at the back. Bon appétit!",Positive
"When [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first came out, it revolutionized my bread baking. Before, I would use my Cuisinart bread machine once or twice a month, but with ""Artisan Bread in 5,"" I would bake at least once a week using the book's no-knead method to produce brioche, challah, and caramel pecan rolls that rivaled those from my local bakery. When the sequel [[ASIN:0312545525 Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day: 100 New Recipes Featuring Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, and Gluten-Free Ingredients]] came out, I found fewer recipes that appealed to me; most of the ""whole-grain"" recipes still called for large amounts of refined white flour and added wheat gluten.<br /><br />So when I saw ""Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day,"" I was willing to give it a shot. Normally, I'll just purchase frozen pizza dough, so I was looking forward to making my own using the same method I'd had success with for breads and rolls. Be forewarned: the book is primarily a pizza dough book, with numerous variations on the master dough recipe (""00"" flour, which is what is used in Italy for pizza and pasta), semolina, whole wheat, spelt, cornmeal olive oil) and various international breads like naan (there was a naan recipe in the first ""Artisan Bread in 5,"" but this one includes the tenderizing addition of yogurt), chapati, homemade tortillas (corn and flour), and injera.<br /><br />The pizza sauces are more of an afterthought to the dough; the basic ""tomato topping"" consists of ""four 14.5-ounce or two 28-ounce cans crushed or diced tomatoes: the world's simplest pizza topping."" The homemade barbecue sauce is a winner, though, with its complex flavor profile of orange juice, dark brown sugar, chili powder and paprika in addition to tomatoes, onion, ketchup and vinegar. You'll also find recipes for pesto, bechamel, and tomatillo sauce. The pizza recipes themselves include some interesting combinations like curried sweet potato, lentil and arugula, Brussels sprouts, smoked pancetta and pecorino, and rainbow beet pizza. Instructions for cooking pizza on an outdoor grill are also included. The cheesy breadsticks are easy to throw together and are far superior to most chain restaurants' breadsticks.<br /><br />In addition to the pizzas and flatbreads, there's also a nice assortment of easy-to-make Mediterranean dips, including hummus (their version uses 1/2 cup tahini, which results in a silky-smooth texture), baba ghanoush, the underappreciated ajvar (a Croatian spread made from roasted red peppers), the Greek dips tzatziki and skordalia, Italian caponata, and French tapenade, that are perfect to whip together for an informal get-together. There are a few substantial soups with international flair, including curried lentil soup, Cuban black bean soup, Scandinavian fish soup, and Spanish Galician Potato Soup with Greens and Chorizo. The desserts are kind of an afterthought and definitely one of the weaker points of the book.<br /><br />Like most good baking books, ingredients are measured by volume (U.S.) and U.S. and metric weights. For baking, weighing is more accurate than volume, since flour can absorb moisture (and thus become denser), altering the amount of flour on a dry vs. humid day. My advance reader copy has relatively few black-and-white photos, so I can't comment on the final printing, but what step-by-step photos are provided are helpful.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're new to the 5-minute, no-knead method (this is NOT the same one as [[ASIN:0393066304 My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method]] or [[ASIN:1118169433 Kneadlessly Simple: Fabulous, Fuss-Free, No-Knead Breads]], as you're not baking the bread at very high heat inside a Dutch oven), I recommend picking up [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first, as it's simply more versatile than ""Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day."" If you're looking specifically for practical pizza dough recipes, then this is the book for you!<br /><br />P.S.: It's well worth the investment to purchase a baking stone, pizza peel and [[ASIN:B002PMV77G Cambro RFS6PPSW2190 6-Quart Round Food-Storage Container with Lid, Set of 2]] to help you get started. Good luck!",Positive
"I recently spent three weeks in Northern Italy, including Tuscany (Siena, Volterra, Pisa, and Florence). Along the way, I had the opportunity to sample regional Tuscan specialties at numerous osterias, including several Slow Food restaurants. Upon returning home, I was looking for a cookbook that would capture the magical essence of the Tuscan landscapes, honeyed sunsets, and simple but soulful cooking that I'd enjoyed. When I heard about ""Cucina Povera,"" I contacted the author, who was kind enough to write back almost immediately and send a review copy via her publicist.<br /><br />Pamela Sheldon Johns gives culinary workshops in several regions of Italy, and  is the owner of an agriturismo in Montepulciano that has a 1,250-tree olive farm. A regular visitor to Italy for nearly three decades, she has written sixteen cookbooks, many with distinctly Italian themes ([[ASIN:1580089232 Gelato!: Italian Ice Creams, Sorbetti, and Granite]], [[ASIN:0743226801 The Williams-Sonoma Collection: Risotto]], [[ASIN:B000OV1C5W Prosciutto, Pancetta, Salame]], etc.). Her latest work ""Cucina Povera: Tuscan Peasant Cooking"" focuses on peasant dishes borne of necessity and hardship that are now served in restaurants around the world.<br /><br />Hit particularly hard during and after WWII, many Tuscan families lived on the brink of starvation, forced to forage and hunt. Leftovers were scrupulously reused, particularly unsalted bread. This gave rise to dishes like ribollita (""reboiled"" soup made from vegetables, olive oil, and stale bread) and panzanella (bread salad dressed with tomatoes and olive oil). ""Cucina Povera"" includes several personal stories from elderly Italians who lived through dire poverty, and their memories of special foods that brightened otherwise difficult times. The memoirs provide a historical footnote to the recipes within without overwhelming the main function as cookbook (roughly the first forty pages are taken up by various interviews and introductions to various areas of Tuscany). There are interesting historical tidbits scattered throughout.<br /><br />Recipe titles are given in Italian in a large, flowing font with a smaller English translation underneath (both Italian and English titles are indexed, with the Italian recipe names printed in italics). Ingredients and instructions are straightforward and brief for many recipes. Most ingredients are limited largely to pantry staples and bread, olive oil, herbs, and fresh produce (the notable exception are the recipes calling for chestnut flour).  If you want to speed things along, using canned stock and canned cooked beans will speed up your cooking time.<br /><br />Some of the more unusual recipes that caught my eye were schiacciata all'uva (grape foccacia studded with walnuts), farinata toscana (cornmeal, kale, and bean soup), and pomodori, fagoioli e cipolline (roasted tomatoes, beans and onions). You'll also find simple, comfort food favorites pici (fat rolled noodles), frittatas, polenta (including a chestnut variation), meat and game, and regional sweets like Sienese cantucci, ricciarelli, and brutti ma buoni.<br /><br />I tried making several of the recipes, starting with the roasted tomatoes, beans and onions. The recipe, like many in the book, relies on a few star ingredients, allowing the flavor of each to shine through. I tracked down cipolline onions and fennel to go with the potatoes, tomatoes, and cannellini beans. Perhaps it was the type of potato I used (baby Dutch yellow), but despite baking for the 35 minutes at 400 called for in the recipe, even after an additional hour of roasting, the potatoes remained hard (the other ingredients softened into a buttery sweetness, particularly the cipolline onions and fennel). The next time I make this, I may parboil the potatoes first. The next recipe was the farro soup, which uses a simple base of onion, garlic, carrot and celery to complement the nutty sweetness of the farro. A garnish of parsley adds a dash of bright flavor. Finally, the roasted chicken with vin santo is massaged with aromatic herbs and olive oil, and the pan drippings are then deglazed with marsala (or another fortified wine). The end result was soul-warming comfort food perfect for a blustery fall or winter's day.<br /><br />The cookbook is gorgeous to look at as well, with heavy paper and deckled edges. The photography vividly captures various aspects of the Tuscan landscapes, from medieval skylines to its interviewed elderly residents cooking and preparing local food. There are a number of historic photographs as well as ample photos of finished dishes. The photographs and pages are matte, so there is no issue of glare if using a cookbook holder.  At the back are a list of resources and metric conversions and equivalents.<br /><br />This is a lovely cookbook that captures the flavors and history behind some of Tuscany's well-known dishes, and a beautiful souvenir for those fortunate enough to have visited some of the varied Tuscan provinces highlighted within.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Andrews McMeel Publishing)",Positive
"Debra Samuels, a longtime resident of Japan, demystifies Japanese homestyle cooking in ""My Japanese Table."" Included are such favorites as sushi (including hand-rolled sushi and chirashi-zushi), skewers (grilled mixed veggie and tofu, chicken), donburi (one-dish meat and rice bowls), okonomiyaki (cabbage and egg ""pancakes""), and a whole chapter devoted to bento, ornate Japanese lunchboxes prepared according to a strict balance of colors, flavors, and ingredients. I liked the photos of Debra's chrysanthemum bento box so much that I ordered an identical one from Japan!<br /><br />""My Japanese Table"" is a perfect starting point if you're new to Japanese cooking; it's not as intimidating or complicated as other Japanese cookbooks, and it uses commonplace American supermarket ingredients whenever possible. The vibrant photography and clear font make it especially easy to read and cook with. The thorough intro on Japanese cuisine includes the handy mnemonic device of ""sa shi su se so"" (the Japanese hiragana letters that correspond to sugar, salt, vinegar, soy sauce, and miso, the staples of the Japanese kitchen). And kudos for a particularly helpful section on Japanese ingredients with clearly labeled photos to match. There is also a handy bibliography and list of shopping resources (mostly online).<br /><br />Like Tuttle Publishing's other Asian cookbooks, ""My Japanese Table"" is designed to fit today's busy lifestyle and includes many main-course recipes that take 30 minutes or less to cook using common (U.S.) supermarket ingredients (both the prep times and cooking times are helpfully included at the top of each recipe). Another bonus is that measurements are given both in metric and imperial measurements; no need to convert if you're cooking overseas.<br /><br />I just spent six months working in (and cooking my way across) Japan, so I was really looking forward to testing these recipes. First up were the colorful matcha mochi cupcakes. Mochi are sticky pounded rice cakes (no relation to American ""rice cakes"") traditionally served at New Year's, but variations of mochi are found in many common Japanese desserts. I made the cupcakes as instructed and sprinkled cinnamon on top, but they still needed a little something extra, so I added the matcha frosting from [[ASIN:1584797215 Baked: New Frontiers in Baking]]. This gave the cupcakes an extra boost of grassy green tea flavor (and color) with a touch of sweetness (see attached photos).<br /><br />Next up, I tried several of the vegetarian recipes like the Sweet Simmered Mushrooms, Pumpkin Rounds and Japanese Mushroom Mélange with Butter and Soy. In some cases, I found that I had to adjust the cooking time. In the case of the mushroom mélange, you're instructed to bake 2 pounds of mushrooms for 15 minutes (the cooking time at the top said 20), but I had to bake them for closer to 30 before the mushrooms released their juices. Also, it was difficult to fit two pounds of mushrooms into a 10 x 13 piece of parchment paper as instructed!<br /><br />I was happy to see that some traditional Japanese desserts were included, mostly focused on mochi, anko (sweet red bean paste), and green tea. You'll find favorites like ichigo daifuku (ripe strawberries wrapped in a layer of bean paste and coated in mochi) and matcha and black sesame ice creams. The chapter is rounded out with instructions on how to prepare several kinds of traditional teas (sencha, matcha, and hojicha).<br /><br />Debra is a patient teacher (Tuttle has dubbed her ""The Julia Child of Japanese cooking"") and frequently defers to Japanese colleagues, or includes stories of her life in Japan that makes ""My Japanese Table"" part cookbook and part travelogue. The book could have benefited from a little extra proofreading (there were several typos in addition to mismatches between stated cooking times, conflicting instructions, etc.), but overall ""My Japanese Table"" has something to appeal to everyone, from the meat-and-potatoes crowd to vegetarians to kids (there are several cute bento box suggestions aimed specifically at kids and teens).<br /><br />(Many thanks / arigatou gozaimasu to Tuttle Publishing for generously providing a review copy)",Positive
"Sally Ketchum longs to escape the narrow-minded neighbors of the East Texas dirt farm where she grew up. After the death of her barnstormer boyfriend Tex, Sally decides to apply for the WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilot) program based at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. Just traveling to Sweetwater brings several new adventures for Sally, including the appearance of glamorous model Dixie, a fellow WASP hopeful. The women face discrimination from the male military establishment, from catcalls to more serious incidents of sabotage on planes the WASPs were supposed to be ferrying. But their biggest challenge is that reptilian lawyer Ira Waterman is not only out to disband the WASP program, but he has something deeply personal against Sally as well.<br /><br />Sally's instructors and classmates at Avenger form the bulk of the secondary characters, including crochety Mr. Skinner and Sally's inept instructor pilot, Beau Bayard, and classmates Dixie, Twila, and Geri. Despite the vast differences in the women's personal backgrounds, their love of flying unites them. They're required to complete the same grueling PT and classroom training (including the Link trainer) as their male counterparts, but at a fraction of the pay. In addition, they have to pay their own room and board, buy their own uniforms, and as a civilian outfit, they weren't even granted a military funeral if a WASP died in the line of duty (their families would have to pay to have their remains transported home for burial). The novel touches upon many of the real-life issues that WASP faced, and it's obvious that the author did extensive homework into reading firsthand accounts of real WASP.<br /><br />""Wings"" includes loads of technical details on WWII airframes that will thrill aviation buffs, but incorporates the information seamlessly into Sally's top-notch piloting skills and classroom experience at Avenger. I felt as though I were soaring along with Sally as she put the PT-19 through its paces. The story seemed to hit some turbulence towards the climax (it stretched the realm of credibility several times), but overall ""Wings"" is an engaging read that WASP and aviation buffs will no doubt enjoy. The WASP are finally starting to get the recognition they so rightfully deserve; 175 surviving WASP were granted the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. ""Wings"" paints a realistic picture of the grueling training and substandard flying conditions interspersed with the sheer thrill of flight and a wealth of historical details.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of McBooks Press)",Positive
"This is the sixth book in the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series.  This time, however, Gamache is not in the quaint village of Three Pines but rather in Quebec City, where he has gone to try and recover from an horrific incident in his recent past.  Louise Penny's description of Old Quebec in winter paints a perfect picture of the city's charm and beauty.  For those of us who have been there and  know and love the ""Old World "" city, the author perfectly captures the sights, sounds and even tastes and smells of Quebec City.  The characters in ""Bury Your Dead"" are also well realized and believable thanks to Ms. Penny's talent for character development.  The character of Armand Gamache continues to grow; ""Bury Your Dead"" explores his weaknesses as well as his strengths.<br /><br />There are actually three separate story lines that unfold simultaneously (one in flash backs) in this book: a murder in Quebec City, where the Chief Inspector has no jurisdiction but agrees to assist with the investigation; the reinvestigation of a murder in Three Pines by Gamache's trusted colleague Jean Guy Beauvoir; and a sinister plot involving domestic terrorism.  The complexity and layers of the book are demanding of the reader, but in the end the effort is worth it.",Positive
"Bakery owners Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito's dream was simple: they wanted to create a classic American bakery. Their flagship Baked store opened in Red Hook, Brooklyn in 2005, and the second opened in Charleston in 2009. In their first cookbook [[ASIN:1584797215 Baked: New Frontiers in Baking]], Matt and Renato focused on recreating classic American desserts like cobbler, red velvet cake, apple and pecan pies, and diner-style desserts tempered with more modern touches like matcha (green tea powder), chipotle, and generous sprinklings of fleur de sel. Chocolate stout milkshakes and green tea smoothies rubbed elbows with espresso martinis. It was main street diner meets Dean and DeLuca's, and added numerous crowd-pleasers to my repertoire, including the classic Baked brownie and the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.<br /><br />In their second cookbook ""Baked Explorations,"" Matt and Renato focus on comfort foods rather than innovation; there's a much more retro feel in the photography and recipe selection, one that pays tribute to grandma's kitchen and heirloom recipes in general. It's like a culinary time capsule: the PB&J bars taste like grade school lunches, the no-bake peanut butter cookies bring back memories of time spent ""cooking"" with Mom in the kitchen, while the orange Creamsicle tart will take you back to childhood summers spent drinking orange soda (pop, Coke) on the front steps. Classic shortbread cookies, thumbprint cookies, and grasshopper bars (my grandmother used to make a very similar confection) conjure up memories of ""high tea"" with grandma and her neighborhood friends. That's not to say that you won't find any surprising combinations in here; there's always the chocolate salt-`n'-pepper sandwich cookies, tomato soup cupcakes with mascarpone frosting, or rosemary apricot squares.<br /><br />The breakfast section features the lion's share of recipes, with guest appearances by monkey bubble bread, pumpkin cheddar muffins, farm stand buttermilk doughnuts, Nutella scones, malted waffles, crumb cake, baked French toast, and baked cheese grits. For those who prefer their breakfasts to induce sugar comas, you'll find oatmeal chocolate chip cake with cream cheese frosting and the sinfully decadent double-chocolate loaf with peanut butter cream cheese spread. Imagine biting into a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for breakfast, and you've got the general idea, although this is gussied up with Valhrona cocoa powder and Ghirardelli bittersweet chips. I found that the included amount of sugar for the peanut butter cream cheese spread was a tad too much for me (1/3 cup for 5 oz. cream cheese), so you may want to start with ¼ cup of sugar and sweeten to taste.<br /><br />Regional desserts, especially those rescued from the musty depths of community cookbooks, are featured prominently, including offerings from the Northeast (Maine's Joe Froggers, NYC's black and white cookie), buckeyes and heartland turtle bars from the Midwest, and strawberry Jell-o salad (even before I became a vegetarian, gelatin and I were on dubious footing). Southern cuisine gets a definite nod, with honey corn muffins, buttermilk pie, cowboy cookies, pudding bars, lady praline chiffon cake, and burnt sugar Bundt cake with caramel rum frosting. To appease the various factions of mud pie purists, there are two different versions of Mississippi Mud Pie; the first is a chocolate-drenched, bourbon-laced coffee ice cream tart, while the second, Muddy Mississippi Cake, is a flourless chocolate cake ""inside a cookie crust topped with a layer of silky chocolate pudding and whipped cream."" Both are good enough to make you jump up and witness.<br /><br />As with their previous cookbook, ""Baked Explorations"" is beautifully laid out on high-quality paper. The endpapers are printed in a gorgeous gold-accented design that brought to mind Lomonosov porcelain. The eye-catching photography by Tina Rupp really pops, and this time around there are staged vignettes featuring antique china, vintage books, weathered bakeware, and various antiques scattered about. Reading each recipe's introduction is part of the fun; ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out and broken into manageable steps, while Baked notes and variations are also featured. You'll find a handy metric conversion chart and list of sources at the back, while helpful hints on ingredients, preparation, and storage can be found throughout. One note of warning: Matt and Renato don't believe on skimping on quality ingredients, so you'll see recommendations for Valrhona cocoa and other premium items. Use the best you can afford (or find), and your recipes will turn out memorably.<br /><br />This is one cookbook that more than lives up to the high expectations of its predecessor, and will make the perfect gift for any foodie on your list.<br /><br />(Review copy generously provided by Abrams)",Positive
"""Intertwined"" tells the story of Haden Stone, a young man with an unusual problem: he has four human souls trapped inside his head. Each of these souls possesses a unique talent: Julian raises the dead, Elijah tells the future, Eve can time travel, and Caleb is the brash, impulsive one who can possess other humans. Aden is constantly bombarded by all four yelling at him, which has led a diagnosis of schizophrenia, numerous mental institutions and juvie, from foster home to unhappy foster home.<br /><br />At his latest ""home,"" outside the D&M Ranch (think: home for troubled boys), Aden is off fighting off zombies when he experiences something he's never felt before: total, blissful silence. The voices in his head are silent, and it's because of a girl. He's desperate to find out *how* she can stop the voices. As Aden and Mary Ann learn more about each other, more supernaturals enter the picture. Mary Ann's new best friend is a large black wolf that follows her to and from school, and Aden becomes involved with a Romanian princess.<br /><br />Their stories intertwine into the complex plot; the various characters seek to resolve questions of their origins, several romances develop, all while trying to battle the twin horrors of high school and supernatural enemies. However, there were so many secondary characters and plot developments to keep track of that the plot sometimes felt spread too thinly, even though the book clocks in at almost 400 pages. At least one of the resolutions felt too conveniently ""Hallmark""y, while the violent ending took the story in an entirely new direction. I feel that it would have been a more effective story if more of the secondary characters and plots had either been trimmed, or worked into future novels. It can be overwhelming at times, and I found myself losing focus more than once.<br /><br />The supernatural elements are handled well, if too briefly at times (such as the fairies, witches, and goblins introduced late in the novel), the four souls trapped in Aden's head reminded me of the Robert Downey Jr. film [[ASIN:0783230079 Heart and Souls]], and several supernaturals have names that conveniently overlap with [[ASIN:031608736X Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)]]: the vampire Victoria and her bodyguard Riley come to mind. ""Intertwined"" will strongly appeal to fans of supernatural and paranormal romance. If you loved [[ASIN:0385736827 The Forest of Hands and Teeth]], [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]], and vampires, ""Intertwined"" is for you.",Positive
"""Immortal"" is a contemporary Gothic novel that, well, tries too hard to be a Gothic novel by throwing in just about every convention in the genre (gloomy setting, Gothic architecture, omens, supernatural events, evil, controlling villains, check). Evie Johnson is sent to Wyldcliffe Abbey School after her grandmother suffers a stroke (Evie's mother died, and her father is a military officer stationed overseas). At sixteen, Evie has led a sheltered life growing up by the sea. Her first impression of Wyldcliffe isn't a promising one; forced to walk to the abbey in the rain after the cab driver refuses to take her to ""that cursed place,"" she's nearly run over by a mysterious, handsome, apparently consumptive man on a black horse.<br /><br />When she arrives, Evie discovers that she's a charity case (I kept having flashbacks to ""A Little Princess""). After an icy welcome from the school's queen bee, she finds out that she's expected to sleep in the bed of a dead girl. She's not allowed to have cell phones, iPods, or other electronics. The building is apparently haunted. Her only escape comes from her nighttime visits to the mysterious stranger, but fellow charity student Helen seems determined to keep Evie away from him, going as far as to earn her demerits (three demerits equals one very unpleasant punishment, which becomes more clear as the novel progresses).<br /><br />The novel switches between Evie's first-person narration and that of Agnes's diary. I liked the idea of the diary, only it lessened the dramatic impact of the ""revelation"" dropped on page 268, which I'd figured out early into the story thanks to the foreshadowing. I did like how Evie's language in the present mirrored Agnes's diary entries, though, establishing a bond between them.  Wicca plays a large role, and I found the magic elements more engrossing than the ""romance"" between Evie and Sebastian. The descriptions of the various rituals and ingredients are described in detail. Dark magic and blood rituals are also explored towards the end of the novel, and I felt that those secondary characters involved in these activities were two-dimensional. The last third of the book, and the ending in particular, felt like it could have benefitted from more development; after long, slow passages, everything felt rushed.<br /><br />Overall, a fairly quick read, but it seems geared towards a younger audience. Shields manages to evoke a creepy atmosphere full of secret societies and ghosts wandering the moors. Fans of magic, paranormal romance and Gothic novels will enjoy Immortal. The sequel, Betrayal, picks up where Immortal leaves off.",Positive
"""Good Housekeeping Family Vegetarian Cooking: 225 Recipes Everyone Will Love"" will appeal to a wide audience, from transitioning vegetarians (Chapter Nine is devoted to ""the Flexible Vegetarian"") to vegans (vegan recipes are clearly marked with a ""v"", and many recipes include sidebars on how to make a given recipe vegan).** One of my main problems as a vegetarian is how to make meals exciting; ""Family Vegetarian Cooking"" spices up meals with additions such as Macaroni and Cheese Deluxe, studded with peas, blue cheese, cherry tomatoes and toasted walnuts, or the Wheat-Berry Pilaf with Green Beans and Cranberries, rich with carrots, celery, onion, green beans and a dash of orange peel. There are loads of ethnic-inspired recipes like Vegetarian Souvlaki, Gingery Spinach-Lentil Stew, Vegetable Curry, Farro Risotto with Butternut Squash, Nacho Casserole, and Grilled Eggplant Caponata Salad to add zest to your meals. In addition to fresh fruits and veggies, you'll find a wealth of grains, including farro, wheat berries, barley, quinoa, and bulgur cleverly worked into salads, veggie burgers, pilafs and casseroles. If you're still of the mindset that ""vegetarian"" equals ""sprouts and avocados,"" you'll find that as well, but with so many surprising (and mostly healthy) flavor combos, why not try something new tonight?<br /><br />Inside, you'll find breakfast options, soups, salads, and sandwiches, stir fries and saut&eacute;s, casseroles, a chapter on grilling veggies and the aforementioned ""flexitarian"" chapter that caters to everyone (you use half meat and half tofu). There are many flexitarian Asian recipes in particular, including several stir fries, miso soup, and coconut curry soup. However, for those who are allergic to (or choose to avoid) soy products, the only veggie option given in the flexitarian chapter is tofu (processed soy is largely absent from the rest of the book, except for the occasional recipe calling for tempeh or soy sausage). I would have liked to see high-protein non-soy options such as seitan (wheat gluten) included. Desserts are largely fruit-based (Peach Hand Pies, Peach-Raspberry Galette, Summer Salsa with Sweet Tortilla Chips), and there are a few vegan options such as Vegan Chocolate Chip-Walnut Brownies, Deep Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes, and Vegan Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies that are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth.<br /><br />The recipes come together quickly by taking advantage of supermarket shortcuts such as canned beans and frozen veggies; you can speed up prep even more by purchasing prechopped veggies (onions, garlic, peppers) at your supermarket's salad bar or produce section. Most, if not all, of the ingredients are probably already in your pantry or at your local supermarket. Handy sidebars (""It's So Good!"") extol the nutritional virtues of the various fruits and veggies featured in recipes. Nutritional info is provided for each recipe, but one caveat: just because a recipe is vegetarian or vegan doesn't automatically make it low-fat; the vegan roasted vegetable pizza with soy sausage and soy mozzarella clocks in at 678 calories and 23 g fat. Many of the sandwiches and main-course meals have 300 calories or more; Whole-Wheat Pita Pizzas with Vegetables = 510 calories, Syrupy Banana-Nut Overnight French Toast = 570 calories and 20 g fat (11 g saturated), Stir-Fried Broccoli with Pasta = 690 calories and 30 g total fat. However, by tweaking the recipes, you can lower the fat and calorie content if desired. You can scale back on olive oil and use smaller portions of full-fat, flavorful cheeses; low-fat cheeses lack taste, texture, and meltability. Also, try serving smaller pasta portions; Americans tend to eat drastically larger pasta portions than in Italy, where pasta is simply a first-course dish out of many. For example, the broccoli and pasta dish calls for 12 ounces dried pasta for four people; if you read pasta labels, one pound is actually eight servings. Round out your meal with a green salad, and you'll save calories and add more veggies at the same time.<br /><br />Verdict: the easy preparation and unusual flavor combinations (as well as new ideas for old standbys) make weeknight meal prep fairly painless, and the vibrant full-color photos of ingredients and final dishes are dramatic and visually appealing. This would be a good choice for your first vegetarian cookbook. Like all of Good Housekeeping's recipes, all 225 have been triple-tested with a variety of substitutions and kitchen equipment to make sure that they'll work in your kitchen. A handy metric equivalent chart is also provided at the back. Overall, this is a welcome addition that will be sure to appeal to flexitarians, vegetarians, and everyone in between.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Hearst Books)<br /><br />**A note regarding the vegan recipes: I found at least two ""vegan"" recipes that include honey as an ingredient (Lower-Fat Granola on page 22 and the Health Club Sandwiches on page 52). Also, in the introduction, the book describes vegans as ""someone who eliminates all animal food products from their diet - no meat or dairy products, poultry or eggs, or fish and shellfish."" True enough, but vegans also abstain from animal-based products including honey (you can substitute agave syrup), refined cane sugar (which is frequently filtered through bone char), and gelatin (made from boiling bones and hides).",Positive
"Avery Hood's parents were brutally murdered in the woods outside their house, and the only thing she remembers seeing is inhuman flashes of silver. Homeschooled and raised in the forest surrounding her ramshackle house, Avery is sent to live with Renee, her paternal grandmother. The two have been estranged for many years, and it's an awkward living arrangement at best.<br /><br />Avery struggles to cope with soul-rending grief as everything she's ever loved is taken away from her, especially her deep connection to the forest. When mysterious new boy Ben Dusic appears at school, Avery is intrigued and soon discovers that Ben is more than he appears...his silver eyes hint at his supernatural heritage.  Strange omens seem to plague her (after subsequent murders, her hair turns blood red), and someone is determined to kill her...it's up to Avery to solve the mystery that lurks deep in the heart of the forest.<br /><br />The writing itself was generally smooth and enjoyable, with vivid descriptions that bring the magic of the woods to life. These verdant images contrast sharply with the rivers of blood that haunt Avery's dreams. (sensitive readers beware; there are several scenes involving graphic violence). The supernatural element could have been explored in greater detail. Also, I wanted more details about Avery's connection to the forest...there are hints that other members of her family share this ability. Where does it come from, and what does it mean for her future relationship with Ben?<br /><br />Unintentional or not, there are several references that point to [[ASIN:0316038377 Twilight (The Twilight Saga)]]: when Avery steps into the school office to pick up her schedule on the first day, the mysterious, beautiful new guy rushes in, refuses to look at her as she takes in his freaky silver eyes, and disappears just as quickly. Later, when she asks Ben his age, he replies ""Seventeen,"" to which Avery asks, ""Seventeen for how long?"" as her voice shakes.<br /><br />The biggest flaw for me was the villain; after developing a complex universe centered around the woods and its supernatural / spiritual heritage and infusing the story with a palpable sense of suspense and lurking evil, the final confrontation felt like a letdown. I had the urge to laugh at the absurdity of it all. The ""villain,"" once finally revealed, projects none of the sense of foreboding that shadows Avery  and her family throughout much of the novel, perhaps because his character  is mentioned so fleetingly (it seemed far likelier that another secondary character would  be the villain based on his description).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fast-paced, well-written read that beautifully describes the process of grieving and recovery in the aftermath of a brutal attack, of finding love in unexpected places, and embracing the unknown.",Positive
"Fighter pilot Robin Olds was born with flying in his blood. His father Robert Olds was a captain in the Army Air Corps, and houseguests included the likes of Hap Arnold, Tooey Spaatz, Fiorello La Guardia, and other WWI pilots. When Robin's mother died when he was four, he asked his father if she was in heaven with all the other airplanes. He went on his first flight at age eight. Robin entered West Point in 1940, where he combined his love of flying with football. On June 1, 1943, Robin graduated West Point and entered pilot training in the P-38 Lightning, later transitioning to the P-51 Mustang. Stationed at RAF Wattisham, he became a major and squadron commander at age 22.<br /><br />Post-war, after a brief stint as a football coach at West Point, Robin returned to flying as part of an aerobatic jet demonstration team. He missed out on the Korean War (in part due to the string-pulling by his wife, Hollywood actress Ella Raines) and was assigned to the Pentagon during the Cold War.  He finally got his chance to plunge back into aerial combat in Vietnam, where he led the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing in Ubon, Thailand. And it's here that his leadership truly shone; he combined his WWII dogfighting experience with the lessons learned over two decades of active duty in the Air Force: know your mission. Know your people: what their job entails, and their role in the organization. Ask questions. Get your hands dirty (Robin learned aircraft maintenance from his crew chief Glen Wold at Wattisham). Recognize accomplishment. Accept ultimate responsibility. Foster unit spirit, but not at the expense of others.<br /><br />Robin's command at 8th TAC marked a turnaround; unlike his predecessor, who'd only flown 12 missions in 10 months, Robin added himself to the flight schedule as a rookie, challenging his more combat-experienced pilots to train him in the F-4C Phantom. On January 2, 1967, Robin and his men launched Operation Bolo, an attempt to engage MiG-21's by masquerading as F-105s. They shot down seven MiGs that day (Olds himself claimed one). To keep himself from getting rotated out after his 100 missions in Vietnam, he'd secretly erase missions from the board, leaving his ""official"" tally just short of 100 (he actually flew 152 combat missions over Vietnam). Despite his wishes, Robin was eventually sent Stateside, where he briefed LBJ and encountered hippies and anti-war protesters for the first time. He was promoted to Brigadier General in 1968 and relocated to Colorado Springs as commandant of the Air Force Academy. His last post was director of aerospace safety at Norton AFB, and he retired on June 1, 1973 after 30 years of service.<br /><br />Told in the first person, ""Fighter Pilot"" was completed after Robin's death in 2007 by his daughter Christina and author Ed Rasimus ([[ASIN:031294876X Palace Cobra: A Fighter Pilot in the Vietnam Air War]]). Far from ghost writing, Robin's gruff voice takes the lead, including plenty of colorful language and intense combat descriptions. But Robin has his share of all-too-human moments; his disintegrating marriage is a recurring theme that makes his homecomings uncomfortable (Ella refused to live on base or have her daughters attend base schools). True, there are some awkward transitions, such as when Robin loses close friends in combat or air accidents, only to be merrily moving along in the next paragraph, but overall, this reads like a conversation to a close friend (I can almost picture a group of fighter pilot aces sitting around in a bar swapping stories). It's worth the price alone for the fantastic descriptions of life in wartime England and Robin's first-hand account of D-Day.<br /><br />There are some black-and-white photos of Robin's family, his early years during WWII, numerous photos from his time at Ubon, and a few from his later years. Included is a spectacular lithograph by Robert Taylor of Robin's F-4 low-level bombing of the Thai Nguyen steel mill (although it would have had greater impact in color). However, I would have liked to see photos of the caricatures that Robin mentions several times. The thorough index also includes all squadrons, bases, and divisions mentioned in the book in addition to definitions, events, and people referenced.<br /><br />""Fighter Pilot"" is a rollicking read that expounds on the beautiful combination of man and machine (""You are something more than earthbound man. You are augmented and expanded by the miracle of the machine"") contrasted against the horrors of war. Robin was the true embodiment of Air Force leadership: service before self. Not just an ace pilot, he was a born leader and wasn't afraid to speak his mind in defense of his men. A must-have for military and aviation buffs and a must-read for anyone in the Air Force; I hope this becomes required reading and shows up on next year's CSAF Reading List.",Positive
"Jennifer Lynn Barnes' ""Raised by Wolves"" is a fast-paced look at Were pack life from the view of an outsider. Bronwyn Alessia St. Vincent Clare (Bryn for short) is a tough-as-nails teenager raised by a pack of werewolves. Unlike them, she's fully human, but alpha male Callum has Marked her as his and taken her under his wing. Like any teenager, she chafes against many of Callum's restrictions (tough physical training, curfews, keeping up good grades) and just wants to be left alone to work on her artwork. Bryn carefully shields herself from the Pack's shared thoughts and feral urges, especially during the full moon, and generally doesn't intervene in Pack matters, but when an outside threat tears open old wounds, Bryn must examine her allegiances to the Pack and the definition of ""family."" She's obsessed with Chase, a fellow Were attack survivor, and will do anything to spend time with him, even if it risks her standing in the Pack.<br /><br />Much of the first half of the book focuses on Pack hierarchy and Pack mentality (the Weres are able to tune into each other's thoughts collectively both as Wolf and human). Bryn's best friend Devon comes off a bit like a token character from Glee...he's a meticulously-groomed Were who lives for movie musicals and belting out showtunes. Bryn's other friend Lake Mitchell lives out-of-state on the periphery of Callum's territory and is a frontier gunslinger. She has the unpleasant distinction of being one of only a handful of female Weres...and the author alludes to some past sexual trauma related to this. The second half focuses on Bryn's hunt for a rogue Were, and the pace picks up considerably.<br /><br />Barnes' writing style vaults between human thoughts and werewolf ones (generally disjointed, in brief bursts of ideas). There are also numerous episodes of graphic violence related to the central plot; it's definitely gorier than a lot of other YA werewolf fiction I've read. Curiously enough, despite the intensely physical nature of Weres, most of the story is asexual. The author definitely treads into some New Age territory with psychic mind melding and being able to see the future, and I would have liked more physical descriptions of the Change (an area that [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]] fleshed out nicely) that Weres undergo.  Also, the final 30 pages felt a bit anticlimactic and like a setup for an obligatory sequel.<br /><br />Overall, this is an engrossing read that fans of werewolf lore will enjoy.",Positive
"Virginia Willis's Bon Appetit, Y'All is a magical blend of Southern charm and French cuisine. Virginia compiles three generations of Southern recipes from her grandmother Meme, her mama, and herself (trained at culinary schools in France, Virginia's recipes reflect traditional French cuisine in gratins, souffl&eacute;s, confits, sprinklings of tarragon and pots de cr&egrave;me). Frequently, recipes will be paired with their counterparts; cheese straws are next to cheesy gougeres, pot roast and brisket cozy up to boeuf bourignonne, and fried chicken and gravy share court with tarragon chicken salad and coq au vin.<br /><br />In addition to beef, pork, lamb and poultry, there are numerous seafood recipes for shrimp and grits, crawfish, gumbo, oysters and crab. The recipes call for seasonal ingredients whenever possible, and despite the meat-heavy connotations of Southern (and French) cuisine, there are numerous veggie-based dishes (cold salads, numerous preparations of okra, vegetable succotash, green beans, squash, smoky collard greens and more), particularly where tomatoes are concerned, that will take advantage of your garden or local farmer's market.<br /><br />The recipes are very clearly laid out, each with a formidable note regarding the origins of a certain recipe, oftentimes family reminiscences of her grandmother's cooking and hand-me-down kitchen utensils (the fatback recipe was fascinating; essentially skillet-fried lard, this was served as a country dinner in the past). There are frequent sidebars containing useful information on ingredients and kitchen tools and techniques for a given recipe. Beautiful photographs capture the feel of the dishes, along with country artwork and luscious produce.<br /><br />A wonderful taste of the South fused with French cuisine (shades of Julia, here), Bon Appetit, Y'All is sure to delight home cooks and cookbook collectors alike. The recipes are straightforward enough to be doable (the squeamish / accident-prone may want to skip the primer on cutting up a whole chicken, however), and the end results are well worth the time invested.",Positive
"Rebecca Skloot tells the fascinating, tragic story of Henrietta Lacks, who contributed to some of science's biggest advancements in the 20th century, including the polio vaccine and cancer and AIDS research. Her stored cancer cells, known as HeLa cells, are used daily around the world in various fields of medical research. Henrietta herself never knew that her cells were collected and distributed; despite the millions of dollars generated by HeLa sales (depending on the variety, some labs charge as much as $10,000 per vial), her surviving children and grandchildren never received a penny or a formal apology from Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />Lacks was descended from slaves and sharecroppers, and lived her short life working in Virginia's tobacco fields and raising her five children. She started having children with her first cousin David as a teenager, and her youngest daughter Elsie was born retarded and epileptic, quite possibly from syphilis passed on to Henrietta by her husband. Elsie was institutionalized and died at fifteen. A year before Henrietta finally went to the colored ward at Johns Hopkins, she felt a lump in her cervix. She shared her fears with her girl cousins, but never went to the doctor. Soon after, she became pregnant with Joe, her fifth child. The lump was put aside until months after Joe's birth, when more pressing symptoms presented themselves. Howard Jones, the gyncecologist on duty, had never seen a tumor quite like Henrietta's: it was shiny and purple ""like Grape Jello"" and bled at the slightest touch.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Henrietta, Jones and his boss, Richard Wesley TeLinde, were involved in a national debate on cervical cancer. TeLinde used patients from the public wards for research, including Henrietta. Before inserting radium to treat her tumor, Jones removed two dime-sized pieces of cervical tissue: one healthy, one cancerous. He took the samples to George Gey's lab, where scientists had been trying and failing to grow cell samples. But Henrietta's cancer cells didn't die; they multiplied at an astonishing rate, doubling every 24 hours.<br /><br />When Henrietta came back for radiation treatment, it initially appeared that her cancer was cured; doctors found no new masses, despite Henrietta's complaints of pain. Doctors dismissed her claims on several other occasions, until she ended up in the hospital with a large inoperable tumor that blocked her urethra. Henrietta declined rapidly, and her abdomen was scorched black from the radiation treatments. This didn't stop the spread of the tumors, which seemed to appear daily on nearly every surface. Henrietta was in excruciating pain during her two-month hospitalization; it was so acute that she was strapped to her bed to keep her from thrashing onto the floor. She died at age 31 on October 4, 1951 from acute uremia; because doctors were not able to pass a catheter into her bladder, the toxins in her urine built up in her bloodstream. During the autopsy, her body was so riddled with tumors that it appeared that she had ropes of pearls inside her abdominal cavity.<br /><br />Her four children were shuttled between relatives, where they were subjected to verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Two of them would later be involved in murder and substance abuse; all suffered from health problems and didn't have adequate insurance. When Rebecca Skloot tried to meet with them in order to conduct research, she was faced with fierce initial resistance. The surviving Lackses were deeply angry, frightened and confused about the theft of their mother's cells and the enormous profits that they generated for biotech companies (however, the initial samples taken by Jones and cultivated by Gey were given away to other researchers without profit); they'd also been hit by a con man claiming to help them research their mother's hospitalization and treatment at Hopkins. But Rebecca is finally admitted into their inner circle, and tells their story largely in their own words recreated from numerous interviews and visits. She takes the time to truly help them understand the impact of their mother's legacy (they had limited formal education), and to set up a Henrietta Lacks Foundation to be used as scholarship money for Henrietta's grandchildren.<br /><br />The chapters shuttle between Henrietta's final months in 1951 and the development of the HeLa line throughout the 1950s to today, as well as Rebecca's meetings with the family in 1999-2001.  Each chapter heading has a timeline graphic clearly showing the timeframe, which helps to follow along. Henrietta's enormous contribution is discussed in detail, as is the emerging field of bioethics and cloning. Several tabloid-style articles referring to HeLa merged with plant and animal cells conjure nightmarish sci-fi images of giant mice men and human plants (there are references to Jurassic Park). I was deeply interested in biology and anatomy / physiology in high school, so I had no problem following the scientific aspects of the story.<br /><br />There are numerous vintage photographs of Henrietta and her young family, the town of Clover, VA, and more recent family photos. A fairly comprehensive notes section is also included.  I couldn't put the book down; Henrietta's story is gripping; not just for her contribution to science, but as a vibrant portrait of a loving mother whose children never get to know her, and the deep hurts that Rebecca tries to heal.",Positive
"Martha Hall Foose's ""Screen Doors and Sweet Tea"" is a lovely look at Southern culture and its cuisine. Many of the recipes are linked to Mississippi and Louisiana, but most are common across the South (okra, fried chicken, cheese straws, pot likker greens, cornbread). Each recipe is prefaced by a short story about its origins, full of reminiscences and funny stories. There are also helpful notes along the margins regarding possible variations and alternate ingredients.<br /><br />The appetizer section ""Mailbox Happy Hour"" includes some lovely cool summer drink ideas (McCarty Pottery Juleps, Mailbox Cocktail, Milk Punch, Cantaloupe Daiquiris) along with nonalcoholic counterparts (Blackberry Limeade, Cherry-Vanilla Cream Soda) and munchies (Roasted Pecans, Buttermilk Bacon Pralines, Yazoo Cheese Straws, Sold My Soul to the Devil-ed Eggs). In addition to old-time favorites like pimiento cheese, you'll also find ethnic-inspired gems like the Apricot Rice Salad and Tabbouleh that are directly linked to Lebanese and Syrian immigration to the South.<br /><br />There are also several variations on gumbo, various chicken dishes (fried, chicken pot pie, chicken and dumplings), pork (chops, glazed ham, Chinese Grocery Pork), beef (Country-Fried Steak, Midnight Brisket, Chile Lime Skirt Steak), and seafood, rounded out with tasty vegetable sides. Breads and rolls merit a chapter, and desserts include Sweet Tea Pie, Banana Pudding, Dewberry Dumplings, cobbler, fudge squares, and several cakes.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are easy to follow and clearly laid out. There are numerous gorgeous photographs of finished recipes, but no nutritional info. This is a lovely addition to any cookbook collection, particularly those who enjoy collecting regional cookbooks, and the recipes will take you back to a simpler, more genteel era.",Positive
"When I was in elementary school, we would drive 800 miles to Colonial Williamsburg for spring break every year. I fell in love with the 18th-century costumes, architecture, ornate silverwork, and Baroque music. We dined at several of Colonial Williamsburg's taverns: Shields, King's Arms, and Christiana Campbell's.<br /><br />My mom has a first-edition copy of [[ASIN:091041291X The Williamsburg Cookbook: Traditional and Contemporary Recipes]] from the 1970s, which I would pore over for hours, soaking up the line art and gross-sounding recipes (turtle soup! calf's head!). The only recipe she ever made regularly was the Bourbon Balls (although she had also tried the cream of peanut soup and the chicken and dumplings).<br /><br />So when I saw that there was a new edition, ""The Colonial Williamsburg Tavern Cookbook,"" I was interested to see how the book stacked up against its predecessor. The first (and most obvious) difference is the color photos, both of finished dishes and of Colonial Williamsburg itself (the original Colonial Williamsburg cookbook was sorely lacking in photographs, and was illustrated with line art).<br /><br />The book opens with a brief discussion of colonial dining habits and ""Tavern of Colonial Williamsburg Today"" (circa 2001) before launching into appetizers, many of which prominently feature Virginia ham (melon balls, biscuits) and seafood (smoked trout, crabmeat, shrimp). Similarly, ""Soups"" also owes a debt to seafood, including chowders, crayfish soup, crab soup, and oyster bisque, with the occasional peanut, bean, or pea soup. The Kings Arms Tavern Cream of Peanut Soup was also featured in the original cookbook and in a flyer handed out in Colonial Williamsburg; it was one of my family's favorites during our visits to Williamsburg, and the home version tastes every bit as good as the original. The texture is almost like a thick gravy, made by softening vegetables in stock, then straining the mixture and mixing in smooth peanut butter and cream over low heat.<br /><br />In fact, many of the recipes in the Colonial Williamsburg Tavern Cookbook are taken verbatim from the first edition, right down to the sidebars. Many of the dishes are identical: King's Arms Tavern chicken pot pie, Chowning's Tavern Brunswick stew, Sally Lunn bread, and tenderloin of beef stuffed with oysters, for example. Others have been updated for the better: the bourbon balls now call for melted chocolate in place of cocoa, and have doubled the bourbon (the original called for a scant ¼ cup). The Shields Tavern carrot pudding spiced with cardamom has swapped cardamom for the original nutmeg, ditched the cream sherry and halved the sugar.<br /><br />The most striking addition to this new version is the number of vegetarian-friendly vegetable and egg dishes, including grilled polenta, carrots glazed with two gingers, bean and corn succotash, mushrooms in cream sauce, and spinach pie. Southern staples such as grits and pickled watermelon rind also make appearances. The most noticeable absence is the lack of any nutritional information about the included recipes; no statistics on calories, fat, sugar or sodium are to be found. Like their forebears, these recipes are quite generous with butter, cream and shortening at times. Also, some of the ingredients may not be readily available in your area (fresh rabbit, scuppernong wine, chutney, cardamom, arrowroot).<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthy souvenir for those who have dined at one of Colonial Williamsburg's taverns, or for those who enjoy collecting cookbooks. The beautiful photography adds to the experience, although not all photographs are labeled. The historical notes make for interesting reading, and the recipes themselves are fairly straightforward and easy to follow. However, if you already own the original ""The Williamsburg Cookbook,"" be aware that many of the recipes here are direct copies, with few if any tweaks or adjustments.",Positive
"Melody Gardot's impressive jazz debut Worrisome Heart channels the retro piano jazz of Diana Krall and Holly Cole while remaining uniquely original. I loved the album, but wasn't sure how the sheet music would translate.<br /><br />Published by Alfred Music, Worrisome Heart features nine of the ten album tracks (the album closer Goodnite was more of a sonic unwinding than a song) in the same sequence, beginning with Worrisome Heart. The song translates well to a piano-only medium, retaining its bluesy vibe (the piano picks up the bass part along with the piano melody). The acoustic guitar melody of All That I Need Is Love translates to the right-hand melody, while the Norah Jonesesque acoustic guitar of Sweet Memory is again picked up by the piano to impressive effect. The chilling cascade of notes opening Love Me Like A River Does is preserved, closing with the playful Goodnite. The left hand has some tricky rhythmic sections that mark time, so you may have to resort to a metronome to capture the exact timing that gives the songs their jazzy flavor.<br /><br />Overall, the piano transcription retains all the original character of the recorded tracks, with the right hand picking up the various melody lines of the acoustic guitar. The piano-only versions are impressively complete (complete with clearly marked tempos and bluesy grace notes) and blissfully easy to master (I would rate this as intermediate). Lyrics and guitar tabs are also included (there are also violin and other solos marked on several songs). There's not a lot of artwork other than some black-and-white photos of Melody in the endpieces, putting the focus squarely on the music.",Positive
"Cat Connelly lives a perfectly safe - if boring - existence. The daughter of an Irish father and an Italian mother, she's spent her life being who she thought others wanted her to be: organized, responsible, and always there to cook, clean, or dole out money in a bind.  She works at a New York accounting firm for the money and health benefits, but her true love is digital photography. She has serious issues due to her mother's lengthy absence during her adolescence, and at thirty-five, she's still single and has serious commitment issues. She hasn't taken a vacation in years, but after a very public humiliation by her senile Irish grandmother, Cat ends up in Rome, a city she last visited as an exchange student thirteen years ago.<br /><br />Once in Rome, Cat struggles to understand what's keeping her in the Eternal City after a series of unplanned disasters derail her plans. It's certainly not Francesco, her former flame. The handsome Marco has the annoying habit of calling Cat ""Princess Ann"" and making constant references to Roman Holiday even though she's never seen the movie (Cat's grandparents were extras, and even named her mother Audrey Hepburn Verdicchio), but there's little action on the romantic front. And Cat's afraid to contact her Roman family, whom she hasn't heard from since her mother's death nearly two decades ago.<br /><br />Over the course of four weeks, Cat makes peace with the ghosts that haunt her. At the same time, she rediscovers the timeless charms of everyday life in Rome, dodging Italian stallions and eating like a princess, capturing slices of everyday life through the lens of her [[ASIN:B000GHVZQ0 Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)]]. Harmel turns the narrative into a glowing travelogue, a sort of off-the-beaten-path Rome that's enchanting and refreshing. The descriptions of Karina's cooking are mouthwatering, and several recipes mentioned in the book are included: cheese fondue, rice-stuffed tomatoes, Margherita pizza, creamy risotto, and panzanella salad. Most are vegetarian (the risotto calls for chicken broth, but vegetable broth could easily be substituted), all are easy to prepare and perfect for a light summer meal on the patio (or piazza).<br /><br />Some of the plot twists were a bit too convenient for my tastes, but overall this is a light summer read that's a perfect escape from daily life full of the sights, sounds, and smells of Italy. Much of the story centers on [[ASIN:B00003CXCD Roman Holiday (Special Collector's Edition)]], right down to the cover photo of an attractive brunette with an Audreyesque bob on the back of a Vespa, so if you haven't seen the film, it's the perfect accompaniment, along with a glass of Prosecco. There are romantic elements, but the real story is on Cat's self-discovery and the mystery of her mother.  The title is a bit misleading, though; Cat doesn't speak Italian and doesn't really make an attempt to learn to do so.",Positive
"Kitty Pangborn, shamus's assistant to Dex Theroux ([[ASIN:0312377703 Death Was the Other Woman: A Mystery]]), gets to meet the man of her silver screen dreams while on a case: Hollywood leading man Laird Wyndham is accused of murder, and it's up to Kitty, Dex, and Mustard (their driver and ""procurement"" specialist) to get to the bottom of the accusations. Kitty finds it hard to distance herself professionally; she's terminally star-struck at meeting Laird in person, so much so that she forgets to take notes (she's seen every film he starred in). But Kitty and Dex quickly dig up some unsavory truths on Laird's offscreen persona; an estranged wife, a jilted lover and several employees paint a less-than-glowing picture of a man with a hot temper and lusty appetites that know no boundaries.<br /><br />The behind-the-scenes views of the 1930s-era film studios (and Production Code politics) are fascinating, and there's a moment of sheer comedic genius as Kitty goes undercover as an extra in a futuristic sci-fi film. Depression- and Prohibition-era LA play less of a starring role in ""Death Was In The Picture,"" although architecture is still described in detail, and there are frequent mentions of Okies and the down-and-out. Kitty's own domestic life is largely absent, other than Marjorie's attempts to create dishes out of unappetizing substitutes when cash is low. She has her moment to shine in a designer Jean Patou silk beaded dress at a swank party, and does a lot of detective work trying to sniff out the truth behind Laird Wyndham and the sinister Xander Dean. Richards' novel is full of film noir touches and 1930s jargon that make it a pleasure to read.

"Hyder Ali, a retired clerk, is driving his patient wife crazy with his post-retirement boredom. They are a Muslim couple living in Visakhapatnam (Vizag), a coastal city in Andhra Pradesh in eastern India. His only son, Rehman, is a political activist dedicated to helping India's exploited, which gets him into trouble with the police (and his father). Mr. Ali decides to start a marriage bureau to earn extra income, and in doing so, finds unexpected happiness and reconciliation.<br /><br />Mr. Ali, aided by his shrewd wife, quickly gains numerous clients seeking arranged marriages. Farahad Zama does a great job of easing Western readers into India's complicated caste system, along with its many restrictions, without departing from the story and events at hand. Some of the families insist on the unobtainable (the perfect wife: beautiful, pale complexion, English-speaking, rich, matching caste, or a software engineer husband in California), but Mr. Ali is able to match several successfully.<br /><br />The two main foci are the situation with Mr. Ali's son Rehman, who is arrested for participating in a political protest, and the unfortunate situation of Mr. Ali's young secretary Aruna, who was forced to drop out of graduate school due to her father's prolonged illness and their precarious economic situation. The narratives weave together seamlessly, along with the fruits of Mr. and Mrs. Ali's matchmaking prowess.<br /><br />Indian culture is the real star here: the contrast between ancient traditions and modernity. We're given a taste of how Vizag's Christians, Muslims, and Hindus live side by side, of the intricacies of Muslim and Hindu weddings, and the sprawling Indian bureaucracy. There are numerous culinary delights, from rooh afza to idli, coconut chutney, and prasaadam. The author thoughtfully includes several cultural primers masquerading as Mrs. Ali's English ""essays"" that give the reader a background into Vizag, the caste system and Urdu and Telugu words for extended family. It reminded me of the recent excellent Vine selection [[ASIN:1416583688 The Case of the Missing Servant: A Vish Puri Mystery]], another novel set in India that also dealt with Indian arranged marriages and Indian culture and customs.<br /><br />A delightful, sparkling read that is full of moments of humor and unexpected tenderness, ""The Marriage Bureau for Rich People"" showcases both the good and bad of modern India: corruption and poverty tempered by quiet generosity and strong communities. Romantic and light without being cloying, this is a perfect summer read that fans of Indian culture will be sure to enjoy.",Positive
"The Farm Chicks are best friends Teri Edwards and Serena Thompson, who besides being busy stay-at-home moms also stage an annual antique show. Their self-described style is ""farm girl meets Fifth Avenue,"" a blend of retro country-inspired chic and simple yet delicious cooking. Their story has been featured in Country Living, and the book's foreword is by Nancy Soriano, the editor-in-chief of Country Living (the cookbook also comes with a free year's subscription to Country Living). The book's introduction includes Teri and Serena's stories and their inspirations in the kitchen and beyond.<br /><br />Beginning with breakfast, the Farm Chicks offer up simple yet tasty renditions of favorites such as cinnamon rolls, Nancy's nutmeg coffee cake (it's best served warm, as the bottom crust becomes very crunchy when cool), the delightfully exotic cardamom griddle cakes with maple cardamom cream, maple oat scones, and the guilty pleasure of a golden potato bake jazzed up with sharp cheddar. Craft ideas in this section include a scone cozy made out of terrycloth and a paint-by-numbers tray.<br /><br />Appetizers include some upscale ideas such as parmesan rice-stuffed mushrooms, sweet onion tartlets, and grilled cumin chicken with apricot dipping sauce. For lunch, the girls serve up roasted chicken and pesto hoagies, tortellini and Italian sausage soup, and more exotic offerings such as Asian quinoa salad and spinach, feta, and beet salad.<br /><br />Vegetarians like myself will also find many options, such as veggie pitas, pesto pasta salad, 'mater sandwiches, tangy cucumber cups, and sour cream and onion zucchini cakes. Other non-veg recipes can easily be tweaked to become vegetarian (replace chicken broth with veggie broth in the parmesan rice-stuffed mushrooms, cheesy potato soup, savory sweet potato soup, and Asian quinoa salad).<br /><br />Desserts round out the savory offerings with a sweet finale, and this is where the cookbook shines. Such gems as dark chocolate butter cake, emboldened with cinnamon, espresso, and Dutch cocoa powder, and a large section on pies (including primers on baked pie shells, dough, and how to create a perfect piecrust) make piemaking approachable for new home cooks and old hands alike. Nutritional info (including protein, fat, carbs, fiber, sodium, cholesterol, and calorie info) is included for each recipe, and the Farm Chicks encourage you to write your own notes in the book regarding substitutions.<br /><br />The included recipes and crafts are simple and straightforward, making them approachable for working and stay-at-home moms (or dads!) alike. The craft ideas are cute and affordable, many using items that you may already have around the house: making aprons out of old sheets, cookbook jackets out of unused shower curtains or vinyl tablecloths, and a countertop utensil holder using a vintage glass jar wrapped in colorful oilcloth. The book also includes a reusable stencil of the Farm Chicks' signature polka-dotted apron and a one-year subscription to Country Living, making this a great gift idea.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Sterling Publishing)",Positive
"I first saw the Vera Bradley: Cooking with Friends cookbook on vacation in Michigan last year, and recently snapped up a copy at our local Vera Bradley store. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased additional copies as gifts. A collection of recipes from company founders, employees, and family friends, ""Cooking With Friends"" is a treasure trove of elegant yet fairly simple recipes that are perfect for any occasion. Arranged by season, there are suggestions for themed dining (Easter brunch, Mother's Day, Cinco de Mayo, bridal luncheon, seaside dinner, tree trimming party, etc.) and beautifully staged photographs that feature Vera Bradley linens and accessories (but not distractingly so).<br /><br />The wide range of recipes will appeal to all tastes, from comfort food such as chicken enchiladas and divine mac and cheese to elegant appetizers made with caviar and creative (alcoholic) drinks. The recipes themselves are clearly written, and many include insights into the creators or origins. There are delightful twists, such as the guacamole and feta cheese dip (page 21), summer coconut mojito (page 51), salsa-baked goat cheese (page 65), green tea soda with fresh fruit (page 97), Lake Gage chili (page 107), and smoky chipotle hummus with garlic bagel chips (page 166). Most of the ingredients should already be in your pantry or fridge, making it a breeze to throw these delightful gems together for a quick get-together. There's also a wine selection guide, recipes by category, and a handy substitution guide that includes healthy (lower-fat) substitutions.<br /><br />Printed in England on heavy, high gloss paper, this will become a treasured addition to your cookbook collection and makes a beautiful gift.",Positive
"Mahbod Seraji's haunting ""Rooftops of Tehran"" is set in 1973 Tehran, in an exotic world where families gather on carpeted rooftops to escape the heat and humidity of the day, weaving stories and poems late into the starry nights. Seventeen-year-old Pasha Shahed is a bookworm who harbors a secret crush on his beautiful neighbor Zari. At first, he keeps this forbidden desire locked firmly away since Zari is engaged to Doctor, a university student with dangerously Marxist political leanings. But when Doctor is forced to go on the run after catching the eye of SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, Pasha finds himself drawn to Zari like a moth to a flame.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the novel unfolds several years before the Revolution, the political atmosphere is charged, with thousands imprisoned, tortured and killed for suspected subversive political activities and affiliations. The SAVAK are everywhere. Pasha and Zari are caught up in this tempest with devastating effects for all involved; during the Shah's birthday motorcade, a single defiant statement by Zari shatters Pasha's world.<br /><br />Pasha must recover from both the physical and psychological scars in the aftermath, and his only hope of escape is studying in the United States. He and his parents struggle to make sense of the violence and palpable fear that has crept into their lives, of nighttime raids and friends that disappear forever. Pasha's friendship with Ahmed becomes a lifeline as Pasha struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts in the wake of his many personal losses.<br /><br />Seraji's Tehran is beautifully described, and threads of Iranian culture are woven throughout; Iranian poets, celebrations (No Ruz), and traditions  create a rich cultural tapestry that provides vibrant color to Pasha's tale. Pasha makes an engaging narrator, and touches of humor lighten otherwise dark moments ( Pasha's mother's  disgusting herbal ""tonics"" that are supposed to cure him of his introverted nature,  ""Professor"" Ahmed's ""scholarly"" treatise on the dangers of self-pleasure). This is a must-read by a fresh new voice, and particularly insightful given the current political situation in Iran thirty years after the Revolution.  A short interview with the author and a reader's guide are also included.",Positive
"In [[ASIN:0061284440 Evernight]], Claudia Gray introduced Bianca, an almost-vampire who attends the spooky Evernight Academy, home to preppy vampires trying to fit in with 21st-century life. There, she met and fell in love with Lucas, a teenage vampire hunter and member of the feared Black Cross, as well as the handsome Balthazar, a fellow vampire who her parents feel is more ""appropriate"" for a young vampire.<br /><br />In ""Stargazer,"" Gray continues these various narrative threads, along with a chilling tale of hauntings that seemed aimed squarely at Bianca. Lucas, no longer undercover at Evernight, is out of reach on various missions, and after numerous obstacles in their relationship, Bianca feels herself attracted to Balthazar in his absence. Day by day, she inches closer to becoming a full-blooded vampire, from her newfound thirst for human blood to her increased powers to her discomfort at crossing moving water. A shadowy figure from Balthazar's past threatens to destroy Bianca and everyone she loves, and the climactic final battle paves the way for the next book in the series, ""Hourglass.""<br /><br />In some ways, ""Stargazer"" is superior to its predecessor: the pacing is more even, the romance hotter and heavier, and the chills chillier. It's also more violent; there are scenes implying rape and graphic murder, so if you're sensitive to such things, consider yourself warned. This is a treat that fans of [[ASIN:0316015849 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] and Melissa De La Cruz's [[ASIN:142310126X Blue Bloods (Blue Bloods, Book 1)]] will enjoy.",Positive
"In Alex Flinn's ""Beastly,"" we're treated to a modern-day update of the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. Here, the spoiled prince is Kyle Kinsgbury, son of a famous newscaster in New York. Kyle is rich, handsome, and cruel, and delights in mocking less popular students, but one day he picks the wrong target: a witch disguised as a Goth. In punishment for his cruelty, he is transformed into a beast for two years. If he can find a girl who loves him in spite of his appearance, the spell is broken. If not, he's cursed to live as a beast forever.<br /><br />Flinn uses IM-style chats to introduce BeastNYC (Kyle) and other fairy tale characters that are trapped by spells: the frog prince, Little Mermaid and others. These chat room sequences really make the novel feel current before cutting away to the action.<br /><br />Kyle, who changes his name to Adrian after his transformation, gives up all hope of finding a girl who will love him, fur and all. His father ships him off to a separate isolated brownstone where he can't embarrass him. But fate (and the witch who cursed him) has a few tricks in store, and the once-arrogant Kyle undergoes a metamorphosis into the new sensitive, intelligent Adrian, who's actually interested in people's welfare.<br /><br />Tenderly told, with elements of action, romance and high school drama, ""Beastly"" is a worthy update to the genre and a fine counterpoint to other retellings such as [[ASIN:0689870051 Beast]] and [[ASIN:0060753102 Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast]].",Positive
"In ""Evernight,"" Bianca desperately wants to escape Evernight Academy, the Gothic prep school populated by rich, snobby high schoolers who are used to jetsetting around the globe. Bianca saw no reason why she had to give up her old high school and friends in order to move to the secluded academy, which doesn't have cell phone reception, wireless, or even a cafeteria. Seeing as both her parents are teachers, she has little choice but to stick it out.<br /><br />The novel opens with a foreshadowing of the climactic showdown, much like Stephenie Meyer's [[ASIN:0316015849 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]], then to Bianca's attempt at escape that introduces her to Lucas, a prickly outsider who doesn't want to be at Evernight any more than she does. The rest of ""Evernight"" focuses on the school year and of Bianca's uncovering of dark deeds around the creepy school. Other characters include the timid Raquel, who's suffered abuse in the past, and Vic, a happy-go-lucky goofball who happens to be Lucas's roommate.<br /><br />But I have to say that ""Evernight"" dropped the biggest bombshell of any YA vampire lit I've read; page 142 was such a wake-up call in tone that I had to reread the previous chapter to make sure that I hadn't missed something (the narrator suddenly opens up about a whole lot of backstory that had previously been lacking).<br /><br />There's plenty of dark twists in ""Evernight""; violent stalkers, murders, and angry mobs are tempered by the on-again, off-again romance between Biana and Lucas and Bianca's attraction to Balthazar, the most handsome student at school. Fans of Twilight should enjoy this update of the genre, and the novel is clearly left open for the sequel [[ASIN:0061284408 Stargazer (Evernight Novels (Hardback))]].",Positive
"Set shortly after WWII, ""What I Saw and How I Lied"" is the dramatic coming-of-age of fifteen-year-old Evie Spooner. She and her friend Margie ""smoke"" candy cigarettes and long to be treated as young women rather than girls; Evie's mother dresses her in childish pinafores and forbids her to wear makeup. Her stepfather Joe has become a successful appliance salesman after coming home from the war, and when he suggests a sudden trip to Florida, Evie views it as an adventure. Evie experiences her first real crush on Peter, an ex-GI who served with Joe in Europe. But dark secrets chase Evie and her family until a dramatic climax forces Evie to grow up quickly and painfully.<br /><br />The grueling car trip to Flordia (no air conditioning in the car or hotel) brought to life a time when interstate travel was not so smooth or glamorous; most of the hotels in Palm Beach are boarded up. Florida was still segregated; Evie notes the White and Colored drinking fountains, and local hotels are anti-Semitic as well. Evie and her mother spend aimless days at the pool while her normally even-tempered stepfather becomes increasingly crankier (and more alcoholic) as the summer wears on.<br /><br />Judy Blundell has done a fabulous job of capturing the feel of 1947 postwar America, a place where Victory Gardens are still a very recent memory, and luxuries like nylons, gas, sugar and creamy sweet butter are new and unfamiliar after years of wartime rationing. Evie and her friend Margie swoon to a young Sinatra (""All or Nothing at All"" makes an appearance) and songbook standards like ""I""ll Be Seeing You,"" and follow the latest in postwar fashion (long skirts and fluffy tulle are in after fabric rationing), while her relatives listen to radio dramas. Evie's glamorous mother smokes in bed.  After being in such a rush to grow up (stealing her mother's bra and padding it with tissues, experimenting with kissing), Evie discovers that her mother's apparently glamorous ""female wisdom"" comes with a high cost that may not be worth the ultimate price. The central dilemma over what Evie saw and how she lied forces her to choose sides between her love for her parents and her love for Peter, and Evie goes from being a naïve preteen to a heartbroken adult all too believably as her eyes are opened to various adult truths. ""What I Saw and How I Lied"" is a  wonderfully atmospheric young adult novel that explores first love, loyalty, and the price of sacrifice in an engaging (and engrossing) pageturner that will keep you hooked until the final page.",Positive
"My Sister Sif by Ruth Park ([[ASIN:1903015111 Playing Beatie Bow]]) tells the tale of Rikoriko and her sister Sif. Orphaned after their father died, the girls are sent to live with their aunt in Australia. After growing up on the tropical paradise of Rongo, their new home Sydney, with its mad rush and choking pollution, is absolute torture, and Riko (known as Erika in the city) hatches a plot to escape.<br /><br />Riko's idyllic summer on Rongo turns sour with the arrival of an American scientist, Henry Jacka, who's falling in love with Sif. Riko is bitter and upset, lashing out at those closest to her. She escapes up into the hills to vent to her friend Pig, a ground-dwelling Stone Age dwarf with an intense fear of fire.<br /><br />The book inserts a dizzying blend of science fiction (telepathy, space age materials, mermaids, dwarves) and heavy-handed environmental warnings (mankind will destroy the earth!) into a relatively slim story; the main focus is on Riko's intense jealousy of Henry attempting to take Sif away from her. The climax felt forced and the sacrifice trivial; the ending fared better. This was originally written in 1986, and its age clearly shows in the descriptions of the ""near future"": rather than space-age technology, we get environmental disasters such as underwater dead zones, active volcanoes, tornadoes and floods, resulting in the death of butterflies (not quite yet!) and bees (much closer to reality). It's still an engaging read, especially for fans of mermaid- and dolphin-centered novels such as [[ASIN:0312379358 A Ring of Endless Light: The Austin Family Chronicles, Book 4]] and [[ASIN:0763640603 Emily Windsnap: Three Swishy Mermaid Tales: Books 1-3]], but is much more serious in tone than other books in this genre.",Positive
"As the cover illustration of a lumpy dressmaker's doll suggests, Truly Plaice was born larger than life; where her delicate younger sister Serena Jane has pixie-like proportions and is enchantingly feminine even as a toddler, Truly is more like a boulder: large, round, and most importantly, solid. After Truly's mother dies in childbirth, their bewildered father gives up, having no idea how to raise two girls, and turns to drinking and gambling instead. Serena Jane is taken in by the minister's wife, but the large, fierce Truly is cast off to live with the Dyersons, group of poverty-stricken social outcasts. These arrangements end up working out for her: she learns to care for the farm, the run-down horses, and to befriend Amelia, who has a speech impediment. Under her tutelage and offers of friendship, Amelia comes out of her shell around Truly.<br /><br />As Truly matures, she continues to rapidly expand in size, choosing to wear men's clothes, and later, shapeless dresses to disguise her bulk. As part of the Dyerson clan, Truly has never seen a doctor about her mysterious medical condition that is causing her to continue growing even after puberty.  She painfully makes her way through school at the one-room schoolhouse, and Marcus, a geeky brainiac who struck me as an Aspie (Asperger's Syndrome, with his narrow focus and constant monotonous recitation of facts that no one else is interested in), takes an interest in her, exchanging Valentines every year.<br /><br />But even life in a small New York town goes on: Marcus and many of his classmates end up going to Vietnam. The town's doctor, one in a long line of Morgans, retires, and his arrogant son Bob Bob takes over his practice. Bob Bob has lusted after Serena Jane for years, until the fateful outcome of his infatuation shapes the destiny of several people. Truly leaves the Dyersons after a tragedy and becomes Bob Bob's live-in housekeeper.<br /><br />Always an outcast because of her size, Truly becomes obsessed with discovering the truth about Tabitha, the long-ago wife of the town's first Dr. Morgan, a  Civil War deserter. Tabitha was rumored to be a witch, and several Morgans have attempted in vain to find her shadow book, but it is Truly who discovers the truth about something that's been hiding under their noses for generations. Truly deciphers Tabitha's guide to herbal medicines and begins concocting herbal cures for illnesses and skin rashes, and treads carefully among the most powerful of those herbs, hemlock and nightshade. Along the way, several dark family secrets are aired that will alter friendships.<br /><br />A bewitching blend of magic, fate, and the reflection on the power that our decisions have on the lives of others, the Little Giant of Aberdeen County is a rare, magical read that fans of novels such as [[ASIN:0553590324 Garden Spells (Bantam Discovery)]] and [[ASIN:014100018X Chocolat]] will enjoy.",Positive
"Over the years, I've had several friends with special needs children, including one with a severely autistic son, another with a wheelchair-bound daughter with lissencephaly who  couldn't sit up, roll over, or talk and was debilitated by dozens of seizures a day, and another with genetic birth defects and mild retardation. From these friends and their children, I learned a great deal about the ordeals that parents of kids with special needs go through on a regular basis, from grueling visits to Social Security offices to being placed on years-long respite care waiting lists to finding doctors and dentists willing to work with special needs patients. I've seen friends worn down by being the sole caregivers for their special needs kids after the system failed for one reason or another; the waiting list was too long, or money was too tight to afford to hire a helper, so I was looking forward to hearing about Terrell Harris Dougan's experiences.<br /><br />Her sparkling memoir ""That Went Well"" describes the impact that her mentally retarded younger sister Irene had on her family's life in 1950s Utah. Born on the same night that a ferocious storm halved the majestic willow tree in the yard, Irene seems normal enough at first, although her eyes are crossed and she's slow to reach milestones. Terrell's description of a young Irene's verbal inability to express herself is at once familiar and heartwrenching.<br /><br />Irene's IQ is estimated in the high 50s (she will never read or write), and she frequently throws massive tantrums and causes self-injury through biting and headbanging to manipulate her parents and caregivers into giving her what she wants: mainly attention, candy, and shopping trips just for her. Terrell's loving parents refuse to send Irene off to be institutionalized, and her father makes the unheard-of step of starting a support group for parents with retarded children. This is the 1950s; there was a sense of shame at having a retarded child, who was either institutionalized or kept out of the public's eye at home. But after Terrell's father places an ad in the local newspaper looking to start a daycare for retarded children, he's flooded with a deluge of calls from weeping, grateful parents, and from this beginning Terrell and her family were actively involved with championing retarded citizens' rights at the highest levels.<br /><br />Also woven throughout are memories from Terrell's childhood (her attachment to her childhood home, her rocky adolescence, and college experiences at Stanford), an eye-opening family vacation to Europe (including Irene, grandma Bammy, and her parents), and Irene's many ups and downs as she's placed in a Devereaux School (which eventually expelled her), in several apartments with helpers (again, expelled due to her tantrums and destructive rages), and Terrell's constant fretting as she watches Irene's health deteriorate due to rapid weight gain and diabetes. Through all this, she's struggling to raise her own family and to further her writing career, and in addition must help care for her ill, aging parents.<br /><br />Although some of Irene's placements are humiliating (her teenage ""helpers"" don't prepare nutritional meals other than pizza and takeout, refuse to clean the apartment and won't attend to Irene's absent personal hygiene), Irene is never presented as someone to be pitied. Irene is described as funny, brave, and clever; indeed, several passages question the ""normality"" of the rest of us as we all show some of the same behaviors as Irene, whether it's large collections of dolls, to overindulging in candy, to being totally open and unguarded with strangers.<br /><br />Terrell writes with a grace and wit that bring these memories to vivid life, from her starstruck mother who literally lives from one Broadway performance or play to the next, to her talented ad exec father, who used Terrell as his child star in the earliest days of TV advertising, and Terrell's own experiences as a mother and grandmother as she reflects on how we seem to become our parents for better or worse.  Her frustrations over the sometimes-failing system of support for retarded adults and her exhaustion as primary caregiver will ring true for anyone with a special needs child or family member, but the warmth and tenderness with which she describes her family and their wholehearted inclusion of Irene in every moment will enchant everyone.",Positive
"James Howe, better known as the author of [[ASIN:1400094720 The Bunnicula Collection: Books 1-3: #1: Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery; #2: Howliday Inn; #3: The Celery Stalks at Midnight]], has created a moving tale of friendship and acceptance in ""A Night Without Stars."" Published in 1985, there are some segments that date the book (comparing Maria's older brother to a young John Travolta from [[ASIN:B000SQFC0Y Saturday Night Fever (30th Anniversary Special Collector's Edition)]]), but the overall story is a timeless one. There are touches of humor and solid observances on adolescence.<br /><br />Eleven-year-old Maria Tirone lives with her brothers, her baby sister Anna, and her parents in a house in Queens. Her loud, loving Italian-American family rallies around her when she must go to the hospital for open-heart surgery to fix a ventricular septal defect: a hole in her heart. She's always had heart problems, but lately she's excluded from roller skating and other activities she took for granted, like running or jumping up the stairs two at a time.<br /><br />Her friends Tina, Joni and know-it-all Marlene (their authority on everything since Marlene wears a bra) don't do much in the way of comforting Maria before she's admitted to the hospital; Marlene tells her that she'll be getting a heart transplant from a potential murderer, or ""somebody who isn't Catholic,"" heaven forbid.<br /><br />Maria tries to put on a brave front, particularly in front of her older brother Carlo, who promises that the two of them will buy a car and escape for drives after her surgery. But once her family has left, Maria's on her own at the hospital, where she meets Linda, a frequent patient, and Bonnie. The two tell her about some of the other nurses and patients, particularly about one boy called ""Monster Man."" From what the other girls have told her, he's mean, disagreeable, and ugly as the result of a house fire. Maria's first face-to-face meeting with Donald goes less than stellar; he bitterly advises her to ""take a picture, it'll last longer.""<br /><br />But something magical happens: Maria, frightened about her first surgery and without her family, finds solace during a midnight heart-to-heart with Donald, who has suffered through multiple skin grafts. Raised by foster parents, Donald is still scared of dying and doesn't trust the doctors and nurses who operate on him. But he uses his love of poetry to tell her what to expect during the anesthesia: ""You don't dream. There are no colors, only space. Night. But not a night with light and noises.  A night without stars. No stars. Just black, black, blackness. And it holds you. And becomes your only friend.""<br /><br />After their surgeries, Maria and Donald cement their blossoming friendship. Maria learns to look past Donald's severe scarring, and tries to heal his emotional scars as well by offering her friendship. Donald opens up slowly by sharing his very personal poetry. But Maria's stay at the hospital is over far too soon. She's heartbroken at his suffering and taunts that the other children throw at him, at the unfairness of it, and she chooses Donald over Linda, Bonnie, and even her old friends. The ending is touching without being overdone, and a perfect close to this short but sweet tale of acceptance and friendship.",Positive
"Based on history, The Miracles of Prato tells the tale of Lucrezia Buti, who is unexpectedly forced to join the Convent Santa Margherita in 1456 after her silkmaker father's sudden death and the loss of their family fortune. Both Lucrezia and her sister Spinetta are cloistered, but for Lucrezia it comes as a bit of a shock, since she was already betrothed (her pious younger sister had been raised for convent life all along). She chafes against its renouncement of all worldly pleasures and relentless hard work from dawn til dusk, punctuated by prayer. The Chaplain of Santa Margherita, Fra Filippo Lippi, is one of the foremost religious painters in Italy, and when he sees Lucrezia for the first time, he knows that it is her divine face that he will use for the face of the Madonna in a commissioned work. Lucrezia is warned to avoid Fra Filippo and his love of earthly passions. He convinces the Prioress to allow Lucrezia (with her sister Spinetta as chaperone) to model for him, even as he falls madly in love with her. It is her face that superstitious locals associate with the Madonna, and it's rumored that she has mystical healing powers.<br /><br />The novel is based on fact; Fra Filippo did indeed have a relationship with Lucrezia Buti, who proved to be his muse, lover, and mother of his son Filippino, who would also become a famed painter. The authors paint a vivid, richly painted Renaissance Tuscany and the claustrophobic world of the cloister, with its narrow cells, aged nuns, and lack of comforts. Lucrezia's sole escape is tending to the convent gardens, which are the source of medicinal herbs used in the infirmary (there are many fascinating sidenotes on Renaissance herbal cures and their preparations) and also the source of some of the colors used by Fra Filippo; as Lucrezia is a silkmaker's daughter, she is intimately familiar with the natural sources of pigments, and is eager to impress Fra Filippo with her knowledge. The authors also include several detailed discussions on Renaissance methods of grinding and mixing pigments and on painting schools and techniques, along with the rich fabrics and clothing styles of the nobility.<br /><br />The story is at heart a historical romance decorated with the delicate, elegant trappings of Renaissance religious art and a portrait of the vast power and wealth (and its abuse) by Italy's Catholic clerics. The novel begins with a crucial event, then tells the remainder of the story in flashback before returning to the fateful moment referenced. The climax was a delightful twist that gave several vile characters their ""divine"" comeuppance, and the final chapter brought the story full circle. Richly detailed and lushly drawn, The Miracles of Prato will appeal to fans of historical art fiction and Renaissance Italy.",Positive
"""The Housekeeper and the Professor"" by Yoko Ogawa is a tale of friendship between three unlikely people: the nameless Housekeeper (a young single mother), her ten-year-old son, and a brilliant mathematics professor with a head injury. The Housekeeper shows up for work on the first day just as she has for other employers; she's used to odd requests and finicky housewives, but the Professor is another story entirely. A promising mathematician who was educated at Cambridge, he was injured in a car accident in 1975 that resulted in him losing his job at the university and in the debilitating condition of total short-term memory loss after eighty minutes. This means that every day, he must greet the housekeeper and her son as if for the first time. In order to aid him, his three suits are covered in dozens of scrawled notes and drawings. He never leaves the house, hates crowds, and only wants to be left alone with his only friends: numbers.<br /><br />But the housekeeper and her son, nicknamed Root by the professor for his flat head, become friends with the withdrawn, fragile professor; they are entranced by the beauty of his world of numbers, and he eloquently explains various theorems and relationships that have a lasting impact on both mother and son, particularly on Root. Ogawa's elegant mathematical prose reminded me strongly of Daniel Tammet's [[ASIN:1416549013 Born On A Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant]]; both narrators describe lonely childhoods with numbers as their sole friends, and both Daniel ( a real-life mathematic and linguistic savant with Asperger's Syndrome) and the Professor describe their thought processes regarding language and numbers in sensory rather than abstract terms that are utterly fascinating. Perhaps it's a side effect of his head injury, but the Professor exhibits several behaviors that are typical of those on the autistic spectrum (many mathematicians and scientists have Asperger's Syndrome, including autistic savants Kim Peek and Daniel Tammet), including withdrawing into his world of numbers when uncomfortable or nervous, dislike of large crowds and unfamiliar situations, resistance to changes in routine, and talking at length about his two great loves, math and baseball.<br /><br />Ogawa's sparse prose gives exactly enough description while focusing primarily on the developing relationship between the three. The novel's central discussion of the fragile workings of the human mind, the nature of genius, and the ways in which we view our world are gripping and sensitively drawn, and the included reading group discussion questions offer several good launching points for a deeper discussion of symbols and culture as presented in the novel. Those who enjoyed [[ASIN:B0000C7GFA A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash]] and [[ASIN:1416549013 Born On A Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant]] will find much to enjoy in ""The Housekeeper and the Professor.""",Positive
"Jenna Blum's ""Those Who Save Us"" chronicles the Holocaust-era journey of Anna Schlemmer, beginning in 1939, as she navigates the treacherous waters of everyday life in the Third Reich and makes difficult choices in order to survive, choices that will haunt her fifty years later even after she escapes Germany as a war bride in 1945 and settles in Minnesota.<br /><br />Anna's daughter Gertrude, Trudy for short, is a tenured professor of history specializing in German women's roles during WWII. Aloof and obsessively clean, Trudy begins a German Project to try and interview immigrant Germans who lived through WWII, to capture the experience of ordinary German civilians even as her colleague Ruth records the memories of Holocaust survivors with the same grant money. Trudy must also care for her aging mother after her father's death; Anna is silent about the war, and Trudy's only clues come from twisted dreams and shards of memories of her early years in Germany, and a single forbidden photograph of a young Trudy, Anna, and an unknown SS officer. She searches desperately for the key to unlock Anna's silence about the SS officer that Trudy remembers as Saint Nicholas.<br /><br />The story alternates between Anna's wartime experiences from 1939 to 1945 and Trudy, circa 1997, as she struggles to uncover the truth behind her mother's unending silence, to unearth Anna's sacrifices to ensure her survival even as German civilians were starving to death towards the end of the war. Trudy has inherited her mother's sense of distance, her cold detachment, and is utterly alone, unable to freely love. The narrative device works well, and the two women bear threads of similarity in their personalities although their narrative voices are distinct.<br /><br />Poignantly told, ""Those Who Save Us"" gently examines seemingly small choices that haunt us decades after their perpetration, probes the depths of human depravity, and untangles the threads that connect us to our past. The novel is filled with evocative smells; Anna worked in a bakery, and the pages are dusted with flour and the cloying sweetness of marzipan and chocolate as Anna bakes furiously to exorcise the ghosts of her past. Blum does an admirable job of simply painting the stage; she allows the story to speak for itself. We are shown both sides of the Holocaust, from snippets of the Resistance and prisoner networks to the coldhearted SS elite that perpetrate unspeakable crimes and those ordinary German citizens who aided them if only to delay their own deaths. Anna's own harsh judgment of her wartime choices is far more punishing than the shunning the superstitious citizens of her new adopted town can mete out. Evocative and haunting, I couldn't put ""Those Who Save Us"" down until the final climactic truths had spilled out and the final pieces had slid into place.",Positive
"Early in my undergraduate career, I became fascinated by tales of immigrants' children caught between two worlds: modern America and the Puerto Rico or Mexico of their parents' and grandparents' dreams. I read several books on the topic, including Cool Salsa and An Island Like You. Also, I've taught dozens of Puerto Rican students, and I feel a great love for Puerto Rican culture, customs, and food despite the fact that I've never had the chance to visit. The icing on the pastel was the fact that it was a bargain book.<br /><br />Emily is a regular Jewish teenager from the suburbs of New York. Her mother, a college professor, is originally from Puerto Rico, although she hasn't gone back in decades. Her father is a successful lawyer. Emily and her brother grew up in an affluent suburb, and the closest connection she has with her Puerto Rican family is through high school Spanish classes. That all changes when her Puerto Rican grandmother dies, and the whole Goldberg family flies down to Puerto Rico for the funeral. Emily feels totally out of place in this sea of unknown relatives; she can't speak Spanish, and has little in common with her cousins. As Emily says, ""This is not the Puerto Rico of getaway brochures."" She notices the crumbling blacktop, weeds, and run-down strip malls.<br /><br />She's horrified when her in-control mother falls apart at being back in Puerto Rico, and at her father's request that she stay with her mom until she's ready to return to New York. Emily's a fish out of water; not only does she not speak Spanish, but all of her relatives are Catholic and expect her to attend church. Her two best friends are taking a cross-country road trip without her. And she meets a boy that she's attracted to even as her New York boyfriend Noah seems to be drifting away from her.<br /><br />But every cloud has a silver lining, and Emily becomes more comfortable with her newfound family, more familiar with Spanish, and more at home with Puerto Rican culture and cuisine (kosher it is not!). What first seemed like a prison sentence blossoms into a newfound sense of responsibility and independence. The author, Nicol Ostow, is, like Emily, half Jewish / half Puerto Rican, making Emily's predicament utterly believeable. The sprinklings of Spanish throughout the book helped add to the authenticity. Emily Goldberg Learns to Salsa is a heartwarming read that teenage girls will identify with for its blend of high school melodrama, dating, and self-discovery.",Positive
"The Gifted Gabaldon Sisters by Lorraine Lopez follows the lives of four sisters named for classic movie beauties: Loretta Young, Rita Hayworth, Bette Davis, Sophia Lauren, and their brother Cary Grant Gabaldon, and their mysterious connection to their Indian maid Fermina, whose hidden letters and notes contain shocking revelations about the Gabaldon sisters. Motherless, the girls increasingly resent their father and rely on each other to get through Catholic school and beyond.<br /><br />Fermina, it was rumored, hung out with friends who dabbled in magic. The girls believe that Fermina left each one a magical gift unique to her, including telling believeable lies, healing animals, making others laugh, and the power to curse people to die. Along the way, they struggle through abusive relationships, childbirth, and heartbreak. Each chapter is narrated by a different sister, and interspersed between these are WPA archives of interviews with Fermina that gradually reveal the girls' lineage piece by piece.<br /><br />The ""magic"" is largely psychological, but Lopez captures the cultural nuances of two decades that seem to pass in the blink of an eye, from the mid-1960s to the 1980s, and paints a lush, loving portrait of a chaotic family bound by secrets and tradition. Hispanic culture permeates the pages with hints of chile and hot buttered corn tortillas dripping with butter and a drizzle of lime, with the smoky incense of churches, and in the Spanglish spoken by family and relatives. Each of the girls must make her own way into the world, each fighting a personal demon: alcoholism, drug abuse, absent husbands, sexual orientation. They find strength in their shared memories and secrets, and return two decades later to fulfill a long-delayed journey to discover the real gift that Fermina left for them.<br /><br />Lopez's style is familiar and engaging; each sister has a unique voice and worldview, from the cynical and emotionally scarred Bette (who swears constantly and drops acid on her wedding day) to Rita, whose quick temper curses people to horrible fates (she ends up silent for most of her school years in order to avoid cursing people inadvertently). The four narrators are effective, although the flashbacks provided in the supposed WPA interviews felt disjointed. The writing style wouldn't have been permitted in actual reports; the supposed ""narratives"" are written in a highly ornamented style that the uneducated subject being interviewed wouldn't have been capable of expressing.<br /><br />But other than a few small missteps, this is a rewarding novel that reminded me of Joanne Harris's [[ASIN:0060559136 Holy Fools: A Novel (P.S.)]] and [[ASIN:006143163X The Girl with No Shadow: A Novel (P.S.)]]. Just a word of warning; there is a great deal of profanity, sexual abuse towards children, rape, and drug use, so if any of these offend you, you'll want to steer clear. A helpful reading guide is also provided.",Positive
"Francesca ""Cesca"" Marinelli is a tour guide with a ghost tour company in St. Augustine. In her spare time, she loves all-night shopping at Wal-Mart, learning how to salsa and surf, and studying design. So far, so good, right? Except for the fact that Cesca's a vampire who hates the smell of blood (it literally makes her sick), goes out during the daytime if the sun's not too strong, doesn't use her vamp powers, and she's on the prowl for Mr. Right. After being buried for most of her (undead) life, she's determined to live her life to the fullest. As a vampire, she's required to wear a tracking chip and to have a human sponsor, but other than these small inconveniences, her life is pretty normal. Like Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire novels, there is a violent anti-vampire group, the Covenant, that seeks to find and destroy vamps.<br /><br />Cesca is a refreshing narrator; a psychic, her take-no-prisoners attitude is tested when she's involved in a murder investigation; special investigator Deke Saber rubs her the wrong way. Cesca's never been romantically involved, and Deke starts to get on her nerves in other ways that she didn't expect. Cesca starts to resent all the happy couples that surround her and fears that she'll be single forever, but fate has other plans.<br /><br />Things get weirder for Cesca as the same tourists appear for repeat ghost tours (and yes, ghosts do make appearances), and a mysterious magical cat follows her around. As the evidence piles up, so does the danger facing Cesca and her friends. There was enough suspense without being overly gory, and enough twists and turns that I was left guessing until the end. A fun, fast-paced blend of romance, suspense, and magic, La Vida Vampire was a rockin' read and I can't wait for more of Cesca's adventures in [[ASIN:0425227545 Last Vampire Standing]].",Positive
"In Ironside, the sequel to [[ASIN:0689867042 Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale]], world-weary Kaye, who's discovered that she's actually a pixie and not a human teen, pursues her love of Roibin, faerie king of the Unseelie court. Roibin, recently crowned king of the dark beings after seizing the throne by force, sends her on an impossible quest: find a faerie who can lie.<br /><br />Kaye is still struggling with her newfound magical nature as a pixie, while her friend Corny, still grieving over the death of his sister, falls hard for Luis, the human they enlist to help them negotiage with the faeries. Kaye is the only one to know Roibin's full name, giving her complete power over him. The only problem is that his former lover Silarial, queen of Seelie, also wants to use Roibin as a pawn to control both courts.<br /><br />Ironside contains much more graphic violence as the war between the faerie factions kicks into deadly high gear. The Seelie and Unseelie courts are locked in fierce battle, with high casualties on both sides, and Kaye may hold the key to preventing the death of those she loves.<br /><br />An enchanting sequel, Ironside gave a much deeper look at Roibin's horrific past and the physical and emotional scars he bears. As with Tithe, there is a great deal of swearing, drinking / drug use, and violence, so sensitive readers beware. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Kaye and Roibin.",Positive
"Patty Pinner, author of the recent Sweety [[ASIN:1561588482 Sweety Pies: An Uncommon Collection of Womanish Observations, with Pie]], revisits the sweet desserts of her childhood in her first book Sweets, along with memories of growing up in Saginaw and of her family from Mississippi. The book is graced with vintage black-and-white snapshots of the author and her family (she has the most captivating, confident smile as a little girl) that illustrate the many down-home, Southern soul food staples: puddings, cobblers, pies, rich cakes, homemade candy, cookies, and ice cream. But the stories nearly upstage the desserts: tales of fanatically clean relatives, childhood birthday parties, the mysterious lives of grownups, and the lives of various family members intertwine with the comforting desserts of a Southern legacy (pecans, molasses, coconut and brown sugar all have starring roles).<br /><br />Some of the more unusual offerings include a Dr. Pepper cake (there's Dr. Pepper in both the cake and the frosting; it adds moistness, similar to a Coca-Cola cake), a sweet potato cheesecake, a lemon rum cake, and recipes born from thrift, such as butter bean pie, mashed potato and bean fudges, and little of nothing pie (milk, sugar, flour, vanilla, butter and cinnamon).<br /><br />The ingredients are items that are probably sitting in your pantry or cabinets right now, so there's no reason not to give some of these wonderful heirloom recipes a try; why not sample some old-fashioned walnut-raisin pie, black walnut brittle, old-fashioned sweet potato pone, or a slice of walnut wonder cake? If you like homemade candy, there are many recipes for nut brittles (black walnut, cashew, peanut), peanut butter candy, and pralines. Ditto on homemade ice cream: you'll find soothing favorites such as banana, an intense lemon, peach, strawberry, and vanilla ice creams, along with some tantalizing sauces (rum sauce, caramel wine syrup).<br /><br />Honestly, even if you never try a single recipe, this is a beautiful tribute to family, soul food, and a snapshot of Saginaw in the 1950s-60s. Pinner's writing style is engaging and friendly, and you'll find yourself happily crowded around her family's dinner table swapping gossip with her various female relatives as you try to decide which dessert to sample first.",Positive
"In Brown Sugar: Soul Food Desserts from Family and Friends, Joyce White, author of [[ASIN:0060187166 Soul Food: Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches]], turns her attention to sweet endings. Brown Sugar gathers traditional Southern comfort desserts such as lacy wafer cookies, pecan sand tarts, gingersnaps, chocolate spice cake, a fluffy coconut peach cake, pineapple iced cake, cobblers and pies (including sweet potato and spicy molasses pecan), puddings and custards, candies and homemade ice creams. In terms of repertoire, it's similar to Patty Pinner's [[ASIN:1580087981 Sweets: Soul Food Desserts & Memories]], but White includes numerous helpful hints for presentation and how-to's.<br /><br />There are no photographs, but the recipes include introductions that explain the origin of the recipes and handy sidebars. There are also numerous substitutions and variations suggested if you're looking to branch out, or perhaps to experiment with a more adventurous flavor combination (like substituting cardamom for cinnamon in a coffee cake). There's a chapter devoted to fruits, so if you're looking for a lighter finale, you'll find numerous baked fruits and compotes. These foolproof gems are a wonderful way to slow down and reconnect with a simpler time, and the delicious smells that will be coming out of your kitchen are sure to attract friends and neighbors, who might then sit down for a well-deserved chat over a slice of freshly baked cake or pie.",Positive
"Patty Pinner, author of the phenomenal [[ASIN:1580087981 Sweets: Soul Food Desserts & Memories]], grew up in a large African-American family that had relocated to Michigan from the South. In Sweety Pies, she collects 70 recipes for various kinds of pies, including fruit, nut, cereal, cream and custard, sweet vegetable, and meringue. Like any good cook, she begins with the basics: an in-depth primer on basic pie crusts with step-by-step instructions for single and double pie crusts, sweet tart crust, how to prebake your pie crust, and a detailed guide (complete with photographs) on decorative crimped edges (flagged edge, pinched, rope, scalloped, lattice top) and finishing your pie (polished top and pie toppers).<br /><br />But Patty's heartwarming stories of the lives behind the pie recipes nearly upstages the cookbook function; lavishly illustrated with vintage black-and-white photos, the sassy, classy women in Patty's young life growing up in Saginaw dominate the pages with a take-no-nonsense attitude, from a jilted wife who one-ups her man by attracting interest from other men until her husband begs to come home, to the glamorous lives of some of her neighbors like Miss Dezarae in her diamonds and mink coats, to her Mama's own quiet strength and legendary talent in the kitchen. The pie recipes are almost an afterthought from the depths of these snapshots in time.<br /><br />The pie recipes are simple and clearly explained, although the recipe format is a little unorthodox since the memoirs take center stage (the recipes wrap along the bottom of the memoirs). Sure, there are common recipes such as strawberry rhubarb, apple pie, pecan pie, and sweet potato, but there are some fascinating recipes born of thriftiness, such as Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes pies, white potato pie (basically, mashed potatoes), Orange Tang pie, and a navy bean custard pie. There are also some divine and unexpected pairings such as the coconut pumpkin, apple meringue, and peanut butter cream that are revelations.<br /><br />The recipes call for simple, normal household ingredients, so you won't find yourself running off to specialty stores or health food stores trying to track down rarities as with some cookbooks. This is soul food at its best: a warm, sugary blend of fruit, sugar, gossip, and most of all, love, that is a heartwarming gift for any young woman in your life, especially those who are starting out in their own kitchens and looking for a little friendly guidance.",Positive
"Taken from the time-honored [[ASIN:0743246268 Joy of Cooking: 75th Anniversary Edition - 2006]], All About Vegetarian Cooking is a lovely introduction to eating vegetarian and includes an informative intro about various kinds of vegetarians (lacto, ovo, macrobiotic, vegan), the advantages of eating organic veggies, nutrition for vegetarians, serving sizes (based on the 1995 guidelines), dietary essentials, and menu planning based around a variety of ethnic favorites such as Italian, Middle Eastern, Asian, Indian, and more.<br /><br />The included recipes are fairly standard versions of those you'll find elsewhere. The bonus here is the numerous photographs of prep and informative footnotes sprinkled throughout. For example, the soups chapter starts with the basics of making homemade stock. There are numerous delicious whole-grain recipes calling for wheat/rye/spelt berries mixed into hot and cold salads, grilled veggie sandwiches with homemade focaccia and tapenade, falafel, hummus, and baba ganoush, curries and Moroccan stews, pilafs and risottos, and a chapter devoted to eggs (frittatas, souffles, timbales).<br /><br />In all honesty, I own over a dozen vegetarian cookbooks, and there's a lot of overlap with other volumes such as [[ASIN:1594862346 Mediterranean Harvest: Vegetarian Recipes from the World's Healthiest Cuisine]] and [[ASIN:1557883599 The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen]], but if you're new to vegetarian cuisine, this is a very serviceable introduction to some of the varied, tasty possibilities.",Positive
"In This Dame for Hire, Faye Quick becomes an ersatz private eye when all able-bodied men have been drafted by Uncle Sam. 1943 New York can be a rough place: Claudette West, a student at NYU, is brutally murdered on a cold, snowy night, and Faye is the one who literally stumbles across her body.<br /><br />Filling in for her boss Woody Mason, Faye and her trusty secretary Birdie are hot on the trail of Claudette's killer, but the case quickly becomes more than the open-and-shut case expected. Claudette was having affairs with a number of men, including a lecherous literature professor, a sinister, controlling actor with a disreputable side profession, and other, more shadowy suspects. Claudette's upper-crust family insists that Claudette's most recent boyfriend, Richard Cotten, killed her in order to grab a share of her family's money, but the evidence (and Faye's gut instinct) leads her elsewhere across the city.<br /><br />Faye's WWII New York is filled with popular WWII standards, automats, and vintage slang that really give life to the setting. The supporting cast includes a group of gamblers, Faye's spunky Yiddish-spouting neighbor Dolores, with her crazy outfits and changing wigs, and Anne the psychic. She also strikes up a relationship with the handsome detective Johnny Lake, and the two share information on the case.<br /><br />There are several delicious twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. The numerous red herrings add to the sense of mystery as Faye tracks down every possible lead, only to find that most of her tips fizzle out, and that the father of the murdered girl is trying to sabotage her investigation by trailing her and reinterrogating her suspects.<br /><br />A delightful read that felt right at home with a strong cup o' joe and some Frankie tunes on the radio, This Dame for Hire will delight fans of film noir and WWII pop culture.",Positive
"Much like her charming debut novel [[ASIN:0553590324 Garden Spells (Bantam Discovery)]], Sarah Addison Allen's Sugar Queen is a blend of food and magic. Josey Cirrini is fast approaching thirty. She's a plump, painfully shy recluse who hides in her closet stuffing herself with junk food and reading romance novels to find solace from her overbearing mother (the two live together). While her mother Margaret was a classic Southern belle, Josey is mousy and timid, with no friends, no love life, and no dreams. She's expected to stay and care for her mother.<br /><br />But Josey's dull, predictable life is turned upside-down when bad girl Della Lee mysteriously appears in her closet, smack-dab in the middle of her stash of moonpies, pecan rolls, and Little Debbie snacks. Della Lee is Josey's opposite: she lives fast and hard, has been arrested for solicitation, and seems to be on the run from someone. The only problem is that she refuses to leave the closet.<br /><br />Desperate to be rid of her, Josey agrees to do several favors for Della Lee, which starts her on a journey of self-discovery regarding her family's past. Della Lee becomes a sort of fairy godmother responsible for giving Josey a newfound sense of confidence, and encouraging her to pursue her infatuation with hunky, injured mailman Adam, who's hiding out from his own secret.<br /><br />Allen cleverly themes each chapter title around Josey's love of sweets, with the candy names reflecting various plot points: SweeTarts, Sno Caps, Sugar Daddy, Mellowcreme Pumpkins, Candy Hearts, and Mr. Goodbar all make guest appearances. Her talent lies in the clever interplay of characters and fate, with a strong Southern sensibility.<br /><br />I could identify with the cowed Josey slowly coming out of her shell as she creeps out from under her mother's shadow; but Allen deftly paints Margaret as more than a cardboard caricature of an ice queen. We discover why she is so bitter, and while it doesn't make her likeable, it does make her a more believable character. Likewise, the supporting cast (including the North Carolina ski resort setting) is equally well-drawn.<br /><br />As I mentioned in a review of Allen's Garden Spells, she possesses that unique brand of magic found in Joanne Harris's [[ASIN:014100018X Chocolat]] and Laura Esquivel's [[ASIN:038542017X Like Water for Chocolate: A Novel in Monthly Installments with Recipes, Romances, and Home Remedies]], blending sensuality, food, and little sprinkles of magic to create a luscious read.",Positive
"Marisa Montes's A Circle of Time is a magical tale that blends time travel, fate, and romance. Fourteen-year-old Allison Blair lives in the 1990s, but after a horrific bike accident that results in her being thrown down the side of a ledge (minus helmet), she ends up hovering between life and death in a coma. A mysterious young girl named Becky Lee Thompson begs her for help, telling Allison that she helped save her life, and expects the same in return.<br /><br />Allison is sent back to 1906 California days before the massive earthquake, and must relive Becky's footsteps to discover how she can help change the course of history. She's terrified of Becky's abusive mother and entranced by Joshua, the sweet young boy who has a chaste crush on Becky. Most of all, Allison-as-Becky feels horribly confused, since Becky's not giving her any guidance. Allison does reveal some future inventions to Joshua, but the most annoying modern insertion that grated on my nerves was the section where Allison is preaching about feminism to 1906 Californian men and expecting them to change instantly; it felt false and out of place.<br /><br />At times, she's pulled back to the present, where she can hear her mother but can't respond. As precious minutes tick by and Allison develops a dangerous brain bleed in the present, her time to save Becky in the past runs dangerously low. After a disastrous first attempt, she has the opportunity to start over (it feels a bit like [[ASIN:B000Z8GZYW Groundhog Day - 15th Anniversary Edition]] for a brief minute).<br /><br />Montes brings the settings to vivid life, particularly the forest where healer Magda lives, and the elegant estate where the Cardona Pomales, immigrants from Spain, live. The descriptions of vineyards reminded me of the glorious setting of [[ASIN:B00006ZXSI A Walk in the Clouds]]. The plot unwinds gradually, with plenty of twists and turns in store, including several mysteries that have an impact on the finale. The ending was sweet without being overdone, and was the perfect finish to this bewitching blend of romance.",Positive
"I'm obsessive-compulsive, and one of my most consuming love affairs was with Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. I first saw Phantom on my first trip to Toronto in 1992, and proceeded to see it three more times at the Pantages Theatre in the coming years. I would listen to the CDs endlessly, memorized the libretto, and bought any Phantom-related merchandise I could get my hands on, including the sheet music. At the time, I was a beginning piano student, so I purchased the Easy Piano edition, but soon after purchased the regular piano sheet music.<br /><br />Nine songs from the musical are featured: Think of Me, Angel of Music, The Phantom of the Opera, Music of the Night, Prima Donna, All I Ask of You, Masquerade, Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, and The Point of No Return. There are also an extensive series of stage photographs (some color, some black and white) sprinkled throughout, as well as brief bios on Lloyd Webber (composer), Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe (lyrics).<br /><br />Many have argued the merit (or lack) of Lloyd Webber's composing abilities, so I'll not get into that here. The nine arrangements are piano solos (unlike some transcriptions, where the piano is relegated to the role of accompanist) of intermediate difficulty that are faithful to the stage and recorded versions, with sweeping hints of strings captured in the fluid, expressive left-hand ornaments and a foreboding sense of dread in the pounding octave baseline introduced in Angel of Music that provides a nice segue into Phantom of the Opera. Generally, the fingering is not difficult, although there's a sticky chord progression at the beginning of Phantom of the Opera that took me some practice to hammer out.<br /><br />Showstopper Music of the Night is given a gentle, lullaby-like quality with a low-key arrangement for left hand, letting the melody shine. The enchanting, music-box-like Prima Donna is transformed into a slow waltz that echoes the haunting minor chord progression from Phantom of the Opera. The other standout is Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, a fragile, bell-like minor melody that blooms into an impassioned chorus and an ending that hauntingly fades away.<br /><br />The learning curve is generally short, with the exception of some tricky chord progressions on Phantom, Prima Donna, and Point of No Return, and intermediate to advanced piano students should feel right at home. Note that this arrangement is piano and voice; there are no guitar tabs provided, only chords. A perfect give for your phavorite Phantom phan.",Positive
"Ever since living in Spain in 2005 and having the opportunity to visit the fabulous Art Nouveau museum Casa Lis in Salamanca and visiting Barcelona's Palau de la Musica Catalana, I've been in love with Art Nouveau, and I was looking for a way to translate that love into my favorite medium, counted cross stitch.<br /><br />I was specifically looking for designs by Art Nouveau powerhouse Alphonse Mucha, but Art Nouveau Cross Stitch also offers designs by Louis Comfort Tiffany, Wiliam de Morgan, Gustav Klimt, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and others. Whether you're looking for feminine florals, bold Mackintosh roses, a stunning stained glass lake landscape (the same image featured on the recent Tiffany US postage stamp), or a brilliantly blue taste of Persia, you'll find numerous project ideas here from table mats to runners, pillows, clocks, and small motifs specially designed for napkins, greeting cards, book covers, coasters, pincushions and more. There's also a handy selection of Art Nouveau decorative borders for customizing your own projects.<br /><br />The charts are in color, are very clear and it's easy to read the legends. Larger designs are presented in sections. There's also finishing instructions, and Hammet thoughtfully includes a section on basic techniques (fabrics, needles, general accessories). Many designs feature color photographs of the artwork that inspired them, and Hammet includes tidbits on various artists and on the Art Nouveau movement. Even if you're not a cross-stitcher, this is a beautiful book that offers plenty for art lovers as well as crafters.",Positive
"Gretchen Moran Laskas's The Miner's Daughter is a haunting story of poverty set in a Depression-era mining town in West Virginia. Willa Lowell and her large, loving family are trapped in a mining ghost town with no chance for work, meaning no food other than meager rations of soup beans and thin cornbread. Willa's mother has just completed a difficult, dangerous pregnancy, and as the eldest daughter, Willa is responsible for household chores and for watching the other children while her mother recovers.<br /><br />The other mining families are just as hard-hit by the Depression, especially those who are foreign-born like the Olivettis, immigrants from Italy. Willa is sensitive and intelligent, and loves to read, so when a missionary comes offering a large library of pristine books, Willa devours them in-between chores, beginning with classics such as Little Women and working her way into more difficult poetry by Poe and Whitman.<br /><br />When Willa's father and half-brother Ves leave to search for work at Hawk's Nest, Willa is left to hold down the precarious fort. As her mother's too weak to work, and the next-oldest is only ten years old, Willa must masquerade as a boy in order to pick in the fields; otherwise, the family would starve. She meets Johnny Settle, a boy around her own age who is smitten by her intelligence and courage, and the two begin a bashful courtship.<br /><br />The remainder of the novel chronicles Roosevelt's projects as part of the New Deal, including a personal visit to the Riley Mines by Mrs. Roosevelt that has a huge impact on the Lowells' lives. The author includes brief notes as to actual New Deal settlements created by the Roosevelts, as well as several websites that give further information about real places and events in the story.<br /><br />Miner's Daughter is written with great sensitivity towards the harsh realities of poverty, including poignant contrasts between the haves and the have-nots in a nearby town. This is a book that is just as pertinent today in a time of recession, inflation, and rising unemployment, and a book that speaks volumes on the warmth and love of family and the need for all of us to realize our dreams.",Positive
"Fourteen-year-old Belle longs for summer; it's when she's free to leave Detroit and return to her family's cottage on Lake Huron. Every summer, she and her siblings participate in the timeless rituals of childhood summers: swimming, fishing, reading, and playing cards in the comfortable cottage they share with their grandparents, sipping lemonade and watching sunsets from the porch. However, the summer of 1942 is different: Belle's cousin Carrie is sent to stay with them. Despite several mentions of pertinent military developments, the story didn't feel dated as WWII (unlike other period novels such as [[ASIN:0345487540 Dream When You're Feeling Blue: A Novel]], the 1940s takes a backseat here).<br /><br />Carrie's arrival upsets the delicate family balance. Raised in France and used to getting her own way, Carrie appears spoiled and obsessed with fashion and society. She looks down on Belle's grandmother's cooking and is horrified to discover that there isn't even a movie theater nearby (Belle's is the only cottage on the island). Carrie rebels against the rules that the rest of the family had followed without questioning, until a tragedy forces her to reevaluate.<br /><br />As with other books by Gloria Whelan ([[ASIN:1882376447 The Pathless Woods: Ernest Hemingway's Sixteenth Summer in Northern Michigan (Ernest Hemingway's Great Lakes Connection)]], [[ASIN:0064406199 Once on This Island (Ramos, Eugenio (Illustrator)]]), Northern Michigan plays a starring role. There are detailed descriptions of wildlife, particularly birds, and of wildflowers, of channel currents and nautical knowledge. You can practically feel the scorching August sand beneath your toes and hear the echoes of thunder as storms roll over the island. Summer of the War is a delightful read that captures the lazy days of summer despite a changing world.",Positive
"I just bought Anyone Can Cook for a recently-retired family member who's as unfamiliar around the kitchen as I am in an auto shop. I wanted something with a solid foundation and ample descriptions of basics such as choosing, storing, and prepping fruits and veggies (a step which is often overlooked in ""regular"" cookbooks), a primer on kitchen tools (knives, utensils, appliances), and step-by-step guidance in addition to easy-to-prepare recipes. The first hundred pages or so are devoted to the differences between produce and tool tips (red, yellow or white onions? Cremini, enoki, button, morel, or portabello mushrooms? Springform or cake pan?). Also, recipes are ranked according to skill level, with 1 being easiest and 3 being easy.<br /><br />Enter Better Homes and Gardens: Anyone Can Cook. Like millions of other housewives, I grew up using the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook, and have several reincarnations, so I had no reservations about investing in Anyone Can Cook. Its organization is similar to the traditional BHG cookbook; i.e., appetizers, soups, salads, meats (including detailed charts of the various cuts), poultry, veggies, desserts, breakfast and more. However, many of the recipes are simplified and rely heavily on store-bought shortcuts such as refrigerated dough and precooked meats (in that respect, it reminded me of [[ASIN:047199796X Betty Crocker Quick and Easy Cookbook: 30 minutes or less to dinner (Betty Crocker Books)]], so if you're put off by the idea of using so many processed foods in your recipes, you might want to invest in the original BHG cookbook. Of course, once you have a little more experience, you can whip up your own pasta sauce or use leftover roast to achieve the same effect with fewer preservatives.<br /><br />The layout is stuffed with step-by-step photos and can be visually overwhelming at times, especially with the choice of bright colors. I noticed that several of the recipes are carryovers from other BHG publications such as [[ASIN:0696213451 Vegetarian Cooking (Better Homes & Gardens)]]. Also, many of the recipes are ethnically influenced, including many with a Latin/Asian flair. If ""exotic"" doesn't appeal to you, you might want to steer clear.<br /><br />For everyone else, this is a perfect, step-by-step introduction to the kitchen, including some simple baked goods, that will allow you to graduate to more difficult standard recipes once you've mastered the basics.",Positive
"Yiddish, the Germanic language of Eastern European Jews that was imported to the US during waves of Jewish immigration, was once a thriving language that fueled vaudeville, newspapers such as the Forverts, Yiddish comedians, radio dramas, and a rich literary tradition. Sadly, few speakers or vestiges of Yiddish's cultural beacon survive in the US. Numerous Yiddish words such as bagel, chutzpah, glitch, klutz, maven, and schlep have made their way into American vocabularies (for an excellent discussion on Yiddish and its influence, read [[ASIN:0061132179 Born to Kvetch: Yiddish Language and Culture in All of Its Moods (P.S.)]] by Michael Wex).<br /><br />Originally broadcast on NPR, the Yiddish Radio Project was the brainchild of musician/historian Henry Sapoznik. He discovered few dozen acetate-coated aluminum discs at a rummage sale, then spent the next 17 years rescuing surviving discs. Some had been melted down for WWII scrap metal drives, others tossed or disintegrated, but the rare surviving copies opened the door to a long-lost glimpse of Jewish immigrant culture in the mid-twentieth century. We hear bilingual advertisements for Barbasol, Manischewitz, and Hebrew National Meats among others, Yiddish swing, and fascinating Yiddish radio dramas (the soundtrack is available as a standalone CD, [[ASIN:B000060P7J Music from the Yiddish Radio Project]],  featuring highlights of commercials and swing melodies).<br /><br />Narration is by Scott Simon, and translations are provided by Carl Reiner and Eli Wallach. The two-CD tribute includes segments on Yiddish commercials, radio dramas, and rabbinical radio courts, filled out by snippets of tantalizing products long gone, such as Brillo Kosher Soap: ""the Star of David is worked right through the soap, it never disappears""! This is a treasure of those of you who grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household, or who might want to reconnect with the culture of our immigrant grandparents.",Positive
"I consider myself a die-hard Celine Dion fan ever since hearing her French-language [[ASIN:B000007U0Q Incognito]] (1987) album. I own all of her French-language recordings (including out-of-print LPs and singles from 1981-1988), have watched her early French music videos and numerous French-language biographies and TV specials, and have read her official [[ASIN:0007104081 MY STORY, MY DREAM.]] biography several times.<br /><br />When I saw Celine Dion: For Keeps, I bought it to round out my collection, erroneously thinking that when it came to Celine's early years in Quebec, I'd seen / heard it all. Not so.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />Similar to [[ASIN:B000IAZP16 The Sinatra Treasures: Intimate Photos, Mementos, and Music from the Sinatra Family Collection]], Celine Dion: For Keeps features rare photos and removable reproductions of important documents from Celine's career and personal life, such as an early Quebecois report card, the handwritten sheet music to her audition song Ce n'etait qu'un reve (written by her mother), tour schedules, Grammy nomination letters, and even a copy of Celine's ultrasound (translations are provided for all French documents).<br /><br />There are recollections that I'd never heard before, such as Celine touring the mall circuit in Quebec during her earliest years as a fledgling artist, and many remembrances from acquaintances, fellow celebrities, and music personalities. This combined the appeal of a text-only biography with multimedia; my only wish would have been for a CD with rare / unreleased performances as was done with the Sinatra Treasures collection.",Positive
"All too often, I find myself throwing almond milk on my cereal or microwaving a bowl of oatmeal and running out the door, but on weekends, I enjoy baking quick breads, muffins, scones, and pancakes. I picked up Country Living: The Breakfast Cookbook as a bargain book, but it would have been worth the full price for its collections of muffins (cranberry and almond, coffee praline, rich lemon, spring rhubarb), scones (ginger, quick currant), pancakes (cinnamon pumpkin, raspberry sourdough), and pastries. I use baking as a way to relax, and generally end up giving away my baked goods to family and friends. All of the recipes that I've tried from The Breakfast Cookbook received rave reviews from coworkers and family.<br /><br />Appropriately enough, for a publication associated with Country Living, there are Southern staples such as buttermilk biscuits, ham and grits loaf, creamy eggs and grits, German pancake, and country ham with redeye gravy. There are also international influences such as a Finnish coffee braid, scrapple, oliebollen, and Irish soda bread. Some healthier updates are also included (zucchini whole wheat muffins, whole wheat raisin loaves, bran muffins).<br /><br />To round out your breakfast menu, beverage recipes (alcoholic and non) are included, as are jams and preserves and homemade cream cheese.",Positive
"Rose Reisman has authored several good books on low-fat cooking, including Enlightened Home Cooking. This particular volume's profits go to the National Breast Cancer Fund, and a foreward from the chairman of the National Breast Cancer Fund. It has been scientifically proven that a diet high in animal (saturated) fat and processed meats results in a higher risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer and colorectal cancers, so lowering your saturated (and trans) fat intake is a win-win proposition.<br /><br />Rose begins by recommending tips on family nutrition, including assessing whether a low-fat diet is appropriate for young children, equipment to reduce fat (nonstick cookware, cooking spray, minimizing salt in favor of other spices and herbs), and low fat dairy. If you're taking your first steps towards a low-fat diet, this is a good place to begin. If you already eat a low-fat diet or are looking for something more drastic, check out Dean Ornish's very-low-fat vegetarian diet [[ASIN:B0002IM29W Eat More, Weigh Less: Dr. Dean Ornish's Life Choice Program for Losing Weight Safely While Eating Abundantly]] that's proven to reverse heart disease (the Ornish diet disallows all full-fat dairy and meats, oils, butter, nuts and anything with more than a few grams of fat).<br /><br />The book is arranged in a fairly straightforward arrangement beginning with appetizers and finishing with desserts. There's even a chapter geared towards children's favorites. Each recipe includes an in-depth nutritional analysis, tips, and make-ahead suggestions perfect for hectic school nights.<br /><br />Although I'm a vegetarian, there were plenty of veggie-friendly recipes that appealed to me, including mashed white and sweet potato casserole, sweet potato fries, pasta dishes, and egg dishes. Also included were several low-fat cheesecakes that I haven't had the chance to try, but which looked interesting.",Positive
"Ghirardelli chocolate was originally founded by an Italian immigrant, Domingo Ghirardelli, in San Francisco in 1849. Since then, it's been bought and sold several times, having survived the Gold Rush, Great Fire of 1851, and two world wars. The cookbook features an informative introduction into the company's early years, including reproductions of vintage posters. A handy chocolate primer tells how to effectively store chocolate (think: cool, dry place, low humidity), how to garnish pastries with chocolate, candy making, and chocolate substitutions (using only Ghirardelli products, naturally). There's even a snobby little guide on how to appreciate a good chocolate (much like wine tasting, minus the swishing). Looking to host a choc-tail party? That's in here too.<br /><br />Once you hit the cookbook section, recipes are arranged straightforwardly by type, beginning with cookies (chocolate chip, lemon, sugar, shortbread, peanut butter, macaroons, biscotti), chocolate brownies and bars (the peppermint brownies are worth the price of the book; I've made them four times, and they just keep getting better!), chocolate cakes, cupcakes, tortes, pies, tarts, candies and bonbons, and chocolate breads and breakfast.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to follow, although the font is a little small, and the photos are beautiful. One of the problems I ran into was the fact that some recipes called for Ghirardelli products that were not readily available at the first few stores I tried (such as the ground chocolate and cocoa powder, although a substitution is listed in front).<br /><br />I decided on the Ghirardelli cookbook after looking at several chocolate cookbooks from Scharffen Berger ([[ASIN:1401302386 Essence of Chocolate: Recipes for Baking and Cooking with Fine Chocolate]]) and Marcel Desaulniers ([[ASIN:0847825574 Death by Chocolate: The Last Word on a Consuming Passion]]). The Ghirardelli Chocoalte Cookbook had the highest ratio of recipes that a) appealed to me and b) actually looked doable by an intermediate baker. I was right on both counts, and everything I bake is a smash hit.",Positive
"For those not in the know, my title is from ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" in which John Corbett plays Ian Miller, a vegetarian high school teacher. His fiancee Toula's Greek family doesn't understand the meat-free concept. Thankfully, Diane Kochilas, author of several definitive cookbooks on Greek cuisine, does.<br /><br />Although your first impression of Greek food might be the flaming cheese appetizer saganaki or greasy lamb or chicken gyros, many Greek recipes were meatless, particularly those that coincided with the fasting required by the Greek Orthodox calendar (48 days before Easter, 40 days before Christmas, and lesser fasting periods throughout the year in which meat and animal products were not allowed). The Lenten dishes in particular, called Lathera (""oiled""), consist of hearty bean stews, stewed eggplants, and other braised dishes with loads of olive oil as flavoring agent.<br /><br />In addition to a brief cultural and culinary history of the Greek Islands, Kochilas also provides primers on various varieties of Greek olives (kalamata, conservolia, halkidiki, megaritiki, thrubolea), cheeses (feta, teleme, sfela, batsos, touloumotiri, galotiri, kopanisti, kasseri, graviera, kefalotiri, etc.), and a section devoted to bread (after such luscious descriptions of Greek bread, the book is noticeably lacking in bread recipes; a sore oversight). Greek flavor combinations of lemon, dill, olive oil, eggs, oregano and garlic, tomatoes and cinnamon, and others are also discussed in the introduction.<br /><br />The book is dominated by vegetable and grain dishes, including a simple variation on the ubiquitous Greek salad. The recipes open with meze, or Greek appetizers similar to tapas. Some of the more unusual offerings include eggplant puree with walnuts, potato-garlic dip with walnuts, harvest pumpkin-chestnut puree, and spicy lentil and wild rice salad.<br /><br />Main dishes are usually a grain-veggie combo, including numerous recipes for orzo (a rice-shaped pasta), bulgur, rice pilafs, and polenta. Soups include potatoes stewed with kalamata olives, tomato and rice, and artichokes stewed with potatoes, tomatoes, and mint. There is an entire chapter devoted to stuffed vegetables, and another to savory pies and homemade phyllo dough, including spanakopita, savory pumpkin pie in a phyllo coil, and onion pie with raisins, dill, and nutmeg.<br /><br />The final chapter covers egg dishes perfect for a light brunch, including a baked omelet with chestnuts and feta, asparagus frittata, and scrambled eggs with fresh tomato and parsley.<br /><br />This is a wonderful addition to any kitchen, particularly vegetarian / vegan ones, as many recipes are meat-and-cheese free. A classic variant of the much-touted Mediterranean diet, it places great emphasis on seasonal produce, whole grains (bulgur, wild rice) and dried beans, and olive oil (if you're watching your fat intake, you'll want to drastically decrease the oil called for in recipes, which many times can be 1/2 cup or more). The recipes are clearly written, and each chapter offers the cook a background on traditional Greek cuisine and regional cooking.<br /><br />The only downside is that it may be difficult to locate the myriad of Greek cheeses (and olives) that Kochilas lovingly describes, particularly if you live in a small town that's not close to a Greektown. Also, I generally stick to a very-low-fat diet with no added oils, so I scaled back on the 1/2 cup or more of olive oil called for, but that's more a matter of personal taste (I recently read where Greeks have the highest per capita consumption of olive oil at 26 *liters* a year!!).",Positive
"I discovered An Ellis Island Christmas while trying to research my own family's journey from Poland in 1917. Growing up, I remember my babcia (grandmother) storing her sewing supplies in a small wicker hamper with a cloth lining. This was the same container that brought my grandmother and great-grandmother's possessions from Zamosc, Poland. When I flipped through An Ellis Island Christmas and saw that beautiful watercolor of a Polish willow hamper that matched my own heirloom, it was an emotional moment.<br /><br />The picture book tells the story of Krysia, a six-year-old Polish girl whose father has already left for America (as was frequently the case). Now, Krysia and her mother and brothers are boarding a steamship that will take them to Ellis Island. Their journey is a tiring one, first having to walk on foot to reach their point of departure, then facing seasickness and storms at sea before arriving at their destination. Because this is a book aimed at ages 5 and up, there are brief hints of immigrants deported for illnesses and the threat of WWI, but the story does not dwell or linger on these darker moments, instead focusing on Krysia's wonder at the journey, her friend and shipmate Zanya, and her dolls.<br /><br />Christmas Eve at Ellis Island is a wondrous experience for Krysia, who discovers that Father Christmas has made the journey all the way from Poland. She also discovers bananas and electric lights for the first time.<br /><br />The beautiful watercolor / colored pencil graphics truly bring Krysia's experience to vibrant life; the haunting image of the Statue of Liberty must have been exactly as my grandmother saw it when she was a little girl. The sepia-toned illustrations of a rustic Polish cottage and the imposing Ellis Island hallways are softened by the melancholy Krysia, until she smiles at last when being reunited with her papa.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book to introduce younger readers to the Ellis Island immigrant experience, and it's even more meaningful for those of us who had a grandparent who immigrated in recent memory . I was lucky enough to finally track down the original ship manifests and Ellis Island documents for my Polish grandparents (who immigrated at roughly the same time as Krysia), and my personal experiences as a second-generation Polish-American made An Ellis Island Christmas even more meaningful.",Positive
"Terry Trueman's Stuck In Neutral was inspired by his son Sheehan, who has cerebral palsy, is not able to communicate, and has been labeled profoundly developmentally disabled. Trueman recently penned [[ASIN:1425762549 Sheehan: Heartbreak and Redemption]], about his own personal struggle with his son's severe cerebral palsy that inspired Stuck in Neutral. Trueman's protagonist Shawn McDaniel is in much the same boat; he's unable to communicate or control any of his muscles, including his eyes, and even his family has chalked him up as profoundly retarded.<br /><br />But Stuck in Neutral, told from Shawn's point of view, reveals a witty narrator with a photographic memory and a zest for life, even if he's not able to communicate it to his family. There's not a trace of self-pity, even though he's at the mercy of family and caretakers for everything from feeding to bathrooming, and he's in a class of profoundly retarded classmates. The plot revolves around the suspicion that Shawn's father is planning to kill him out of ""mercy"" for Shawn's suffering and his ever-present seizures.<br /><br />The binding link that weaves throughout the story centers on his father's poem about young Shawn that won numerous awards including the Pulitzer. Now his father, who deserted the family years ago, is a celebrity for his poem that presents Shawn as a helpless, pitiable object, not the funny, smart teenager that he's become, if only in his head, and his father seems inspired by a recent ""mercy killing"" of another handicapped child.<br /><br />Trueman does a masterful job of leaving the ending open (he penned a novel written from Shawn's brother Paul's perspective, [[ASIN:B000B5RXWC Cruise Control]], that explores Paul's feelings towards his brother and his situation, which is also open-ended in its final decision), and Shawn is an utterly hip, real narrator that shows us how easy (and dangerous) it is to judge someone based on appearances.",Positive
"Although there are numerous young adult novels that deal with WWII, I've run across few that deal with the horrors of WWI in such intimate detail. Thirteen-year-old Annie's father is a doctor, and she's waiting for him at the train station when she sees wounded soldiers being unloaded from the train: victims of mustard gas, shrapnel wounds, and other war injuries. This reality brings the war home for her in a way that simply reading about it in the papers couldn't.<br /><br />Soon, Annie begins to spend time with the wounded soldiers at the veteran's hospital where her father works. Anne befriends a soldier wounded in a mustard gas attack and experiences the first stirrings of romance and adult responsibilities. Her initial revulsion at the wounded soldiers' appearances is believable as she has been sheltered from the realities of war by her mother, and her gradual infatuation with Andrew tenderly unfolds.<br /><br />Overall, this was an inspiring novel that explored heroism, the meaning of sacrifice, and the high cost of war on all involved. I read this numerous times as a teenager, and recently purchased a copy in order to reacquaint myself with Annie's courage and the moving descriptions of patriotism and heroism.",Positive
"Veganomicon, by Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero ([[ASIN:1569242739 Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World: 75 Dairy-Free Recipes for Cupcakes that Rule]], [[ASIN:1569243581 Vegan with a Vengeance : Over 150 Delicious, Cheap, Animal-Free Recipes That Rock]]) may be the perfect all-purpose vegan cookbook: not only does it contain a wide selection of vegan comfort foods (hummus, numerous baked, marinated, and curried tofu and seitan recipes, mac and cheeze), but it also incorporates many low-fat, soy-free, and gluten-free vegan recipes (great for those of us like me who are allergic to soy, avoid gluten, and are on a low-fat diet).<br /><br />If you're looking to move beyond bland tofu, Veganomicon offers international recipes from the Middle East (curried carrot dip, Mediterranean-style cashew-cucumber dip, lentil salad, chickpea-quinoa pilaf, lentils and rice with caramelized onions and spiced pita crisps), India (saag, samosa, red lentil cauliflower curry), Italy (risottos, polenta, pastas), Greek (moussaka, phyllo pie, baked lima beans), Asian (nori rolls, stir fries), and Latin recipes(mole, chili, quinoa salad with black beans and mango). To round out the list, there are numerous breakfast ideas, breads, desserts, dressings, sauces, and even sample menus to get you started.<br /><br />The writing style is hip, funny, down to earth, and most importantly, easy to follow. There are several great guides to varieties of grains, legumes, and veggies, cooking instructions, and cooking and prepping guides. There is a liberal sprinkling of Jewish humor throughout, which I appreciated. In addition, there are numerous updates of Jewish comfort foods such as cholent, tzimmes kugel, latkes, blintzes, borscht, and kasha (trust me, finding dependable, delicious updates of vegan Jewish recipes is not always easy; try Rabbi Gil Marks' [[ASIN:0764544136 Olive Trees and Honey: A Treasury of Vegetarian Recipes from Jewish Communities Around the World]] if you're looking for a year's worth of Jewish vegetarian delights from around the globe).<br /><br />My only gripe would be that there is no nutritional info, and the ""low-fat"" flag is based on a recipe containing two tablespoons of oil or less. However, for anyone following a very-low-fat diet such as the [[ASIN:B0002IM29W Eat More, Weigh Less: Dr. Dean Ornish's Life Choice Program for Losing Weight Safely While Eating Abundantly]] (10% of calories from fat, no oils, nuts, olives or avocados), two tablespoons is two too much, but it's a minor observation.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great addition to your kitchen, especially if you're new to veganism and are longing to move beyond the blah processed vegan foods out there. Many of the recipes are time-consuming, but the end result justifies the means. Also, the authors have thoughtfully flagged recipes that call for hard-to-find items.",Positive
"Rachael Ray Veggie Meals: Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meals is actually one of her oldest books, from 2001. At $14.95 (list price) for a book that only clocks in at 127 pages, it leans toward the more expensive side compared with her more recent 30-minute meal paperbacks that are much larger for the same price. This would be a great first book for a transitioning vegetarian (especially for students going off to college), but there are better, more comprehensive vegetarian cookbooks such as [[ASIN:1594862346 Mediterranean Harvest: Vegetarian Recipes from the World's Healthiest Cuisine]], Diane Kochilas' [[ASIN:0312200765 The Greek Vegetarian: More Than 100 Recipes Inspired by the Traditional Dishes and Flavors of Greece]] and [[ASIN:0764544136 Olive Trees and Honey: A Treasury of Vegetarian Recipes from Jewish Communities Around the World]] that do greater justice to the myriad of Mediterranean flavors and cuisines.<br /><br />The book is divided into suggested menus, soups, salads, risotto, pasta, and Italian vegetable entrees, Make Your Own Asian Take-Out (Chinese and Thai-style veggie dinners), and Snack Suppers (stuffed potatoes, sandwiches, dips, and spreads).<br /><br />The ""menu"" suggestions are quite sparse due to the small number of recipes available; many times, the ""menu"" consists of a salad and side, albeit themed (Italian, Middle Eastern, Southwestern/ Mexican).<br /><br />Soups opens with the prerequisite Chili for Veg-Heads, with three kinds of beans (black, kidney, and spicy vegetarian refried), Tabasco and chili powder, and crushed tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and beer (!). Red Beans and Rice Soup was a nice nod to Cajun cuisine and a pleasant alternative to Caribbean-style rice and beans. Three Bean Soup is more of a minestrone, as it contains red-skinned potatoes, carrots, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, and fresh green beans (no pasta, though). There are several variations on minestrone, including Chick Pea and Cannellini Minestrone. Gazpacho with Gusto is the perfect starter for hot summer evenings. Ray's Pumpkin and Black Bean soup is a wondrous update on classic black bean paired with pumpkin puree, butter, oil, heavy cream, and curry (NOT for those on a low-fat veggie diet!). Quick Red Cabbage Soup was a fascinating alternative to German red cabbage, and similarly contains apples, pickling spice, veggie broth and optional liquid smoke flavoring. Mashed Potato Soup is the ultimate comfort food: potatoes, milk, sour cream, heavy cream, and sharp cheddar.<br /><br />The Salads include Greek-style grilled vegetable platters, a super-easy (and yummo) White Bean Salad, Middle Eastern flair with Lentil Salad and Tabouleh Salad, Italian faves such as Panzanellas and Caprese, elegant spinach salads (one with pears and walnuts, the other with blue cheese and scallion).<br /><br />If you're looking for easy entree ideas, look no further than Rachael's risottos (porcini, artichoke, asparagus, and zucchini), pestos, pastas, green gnocchi, eggplant parmigiano, Vegetable Barley, and Polentas.<br /><br />The brief Asian section includes stir-fries, Cashew Vegetables, spicy veggies (curries, ginger, pepper). Finally, the recipes are rounded out by Snack Suppers, including baked potatoes, pita pizzas, melts (Eggplant and Mozzarella, Open-Faced Eggplant and Tomato), Portobello Pizza Burgers, Spinach Calzones, burritos and quesadillas, and luxurious spreads (bruschetta, tapenade, spinach artichoke dip, white bean dip, tomato spread, hummus). Many are kid-friendly and make perfect munchies for sports nights.<br /><br />Although short and on the pricey side, Ray's choices take classic Mediterranean dishes and make them accessible to harried cooks who need to get dinner on the table in a hurry. Chopping up the fresh herbs and veggies is the most time-consuming step, since the recipes generally come together beautifully once your ingredients are prepped and assembled. Many recipes make use of shortcuts such as canned beans and canned vegetables. There are no nutritional analyses, but many recipes use 2 or less tablespoons of oil (usually olive), and many that call for dairy mention low-fat options. If you want to cut more fat, use nonstick cooking spray to coat your pan before searing or sauteeing veggies instead of oil.",Positive
"Spain's ancient fascination with bulls can be seen in the Celtiberian bull sculptures in Guisando, Avila, which are thought to be made in the second century BCE. Practiced by many ancient cultures, bullfighting became an integral part of Iberian culture, and was immortalized to Western audiences by Ernest Hemingway ([[ASIN:068485922X Death in the Afternoon]] and [[ASIN:0684837897 The DANGEROUS SUMMER]]).<br /><br />Polish author Maia Wojciechowska held numerous fascinating jobs including an undercover detective, a motorcycle racer, a translator for Radio Free Europe, and finally, as a female bullfighter, and Hemingway said that Maia knew more about bullfighting than any other woman, so she is amply qualified to take on the immense task of making Spain's bullfighting culture and history accessible to a younger audience.<br /><br />In Shadow of a Bull, originally written in 1964, Manolo Olivar is the young son of the famous torero Juan Olivar, who was fatally gored by a bull. Juan was the most famous matador in Spain, bringing glory to the small town of Arcangel, and now everyone expects Manolo to fill his shoes by becoming an equally talented bullfighter. The book has aged well, and minus any references to computers or cell phones, could take place today.<br /><br />Except Manolo has a major problem: he's a coward and hates the very idea of bullfights. This would actually be funny, if it wasn't such a serious matter in 1960s Spain. A man's honor was of utmost importance, and to be labeled a coward when you're the son of Spain's most famous matador...<br /><br />Manolo secretly wishes to study medicine, but is forced into digesting hours of bullfighting history and technique and practicing bullfighting moves with young bulls in secret (it's illegal to practice on bulls before they enter the ring for the first time). He's so traumatized by this that he wakes up screaming at night, but he knows that he can't disappoint the entire town by bowing out of his first corrida.<br /><br />Shadow of a Bull is about bullfighting; not the gore, perhaps, but the skill, the delicate moves of a talented matador, the history behind its traditions and the large role it plays in traditional Spanish culture. Wojciechowska makes these numerous small details fly by without becoming bogged down in technicalities or minutia, even for someone like myself who has no experience with bullfighting (as a vegetarian, I refused to attend bullfights, either in person or televised, the two times I lived in Spain). A glossary of bullfighting terms is also included as a handy reference, and the text has a sprinkling of Spanish expressions.<br /><br />Manolo's story is a common enough one of an adolescent struggling to find his place, to live up to his father's reputation, and to discover his path. He is a likeable enough protagonist, although more aggressive boys who read this will likely label him a sissy (or worse).<br /><br />More importantly, Shadow of a Bull is a priceless travelogue on 1960s Andalucia, of the quirks of small-town life in rural Southern Spain (the endless gossiping of old men who do everything together), of flamenco and fiestas and dry, hot summers punctuated by bullfights. This was still the period when Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, and the town's poverty is a testament to those lean years (for maximum historical value, read Shadow of a Bull at the same time as James Michener's [[ASIN:0449207331 Iberia]], also written in the 1960s, for a comprehensive overview of life in Spain under Franco).<br /><br />Fans of bullfighting and Spain will enjoy this book, although it is more about the moves and pomp and circumstance rather than action inside the bullring. Wojciechowska draws a riveting portrait of a typical Andalucian town captured in time, and of one boy's struggle with who he is expected to be and who he is that still speaks to modern readers.",Positive
"Garrison Keillor, best known for his long-running radio saga A Prairie Home Companion, has created another memorable portrait of the Midwest in Pontoon. His fictitious farming town of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota is populated by Scandinavian descendants whose lives revolve around church services and gossip, not necessarily in that order. The town's two religious beacons are the Catholic parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility and the Lake Wobegon Lutheran Church. The residents are proud of their Scandinavian heritage, including the town statue of the Unknown Norwegian and omnipresent lutefisk at church functions.<br /><br />I grew up listening to Garrison on A Prairie Home Companion and attempted (unsuccessfully) to watch the recent Robert Altman film adaptation, so when I saw Pontoon, I snapped it up. Part of my love affair with Lake Wobegon stems from my own immigrant background; my grandmother immigrated from Poland in 1913, and my youth was spent at Polish masses and social gatherings (in Polish, of course!) filled with pierogi and gossip, much like Lake Wobegonians (minus the lutefisk, thankfully). I also grew up in a small Midwest town, so I could appreciate Garrison's good-natured ribbing at the monotony of life in small towns.<br /><br />Garrison's characters are exquisitely drawn, and you can easily imagine them to be your next-door neighbors, full of idiosyncrasies and hidden wisdom. In Pontoon, the central character is Evelyn, an octogenarian with a passion for life who enjoys shocking the quieter Wobegonians with her forward ideas. Evelyn's sudden death wreaks havoc on her family, particularly on her alcoholic daughter Barbara, since her scandalous final wish is to be cremated and dumped into Lake Wobegon in a green bowling ball. Needless to say, this is unacceptable behavior in a conservative Midwestern town.<br /><br />As the novel unfolds in hilariously unexpected twists and turns, a number of Wobegonians' lives intersect. Exiled Debbie Detmer returns from California a millionaire for a ""ceremony of commitment."" No weddings for this New Age guru, thankyouverymuch, but a hot air balloon and parachuting Elvis impersonator share the bill with imported French cheese, champagne, and world-class chefs flown in from California. Meanwhile, Barbara's son Kyle is thinking about ditching his girlfriend and dropping out of college to start a business involving sprinkling loved ones' ashes from a parasail. Pastor Inqvist is playing host to two dozen renegade Danish Lutheran pastors. At the hysterical climax, these and other stories intertwine in the blink of an eye during Evelyn's fateful memorial service on Lake Wobegon.<br /><br />The writing is crisp and snappy, and I particularly loved the flashbacks to 1941 as Evelyn's secret lifelong romance with Raoul was revealed. Spunky Evelyn has many lessons to teach all of us about regret, seizing opportunity, and how to enjoy life to its fullest right until the end. By turns tender, philosophical, and laugh-out-loud funny, Pontoon is a must-read. Be sure to check out the detailed map of Lake Wobegon on the dust jacket!",Positive
"Tempe Brennan's back in her tenth mystery. For those not in the know, Dr. Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who divides her time between Qu&eacute;bec and North Carolina. No stranger to personal trouble, she's an ex-alcoholic and single mother assigned to gruesome, personally dangerous cold cases. This time, Tempe's on the trail of her vanished childhood friend &Eacute;vang&eacute;line Landry, a young Acadian who summered at Pawleys Island back when Tempe was a child. Tempe and &Eacute;vang&eacute;line would spend the summers creating poetry and staging dramas as &Eacute;vang&eacute;line shared her love of Longfellow's epic namesake poem (his &Eacute;vang&eacute;line included a romanticized account of the Acadian deportation and its aftermath). One day, &Eacute;vang&eacute;line Landry vanished without a trace, and for thirty years Tempe has longed to know what happened to her.<br /><br />One of Tempe's coworkers in Qu&eacute;bec wants her to look at a skeleton uncovered in New Brunswick, and Tempe starts to put together pieces that point to &Eacute;vang&eacute;line. She is consumed with uncovering the truth behind her friend's disappearance at her own personal risk. As with previous novels, Reichs does her homework well. Acadia was an area of Eastern Canada originally settled by the French, who were later forcefully evicted by the British. Many exiled Acadians fled to Louisiana, where the name ""Acadian"" shortened to ""Cajun."" Next to Qu&eacute;bec, New Brunswick has the largest percentage of Francophones in Canada (35% of the province is French-speaking).<br /><br />Tempe's quest takes her to the small town of Tracadie-Sheila, New Brunswick. I admit, I was curious in Reichs' choice of town, because one of my favorite Francophone pop artists, Jean-François Breau, ([[ASIN:B000DZJHSI Expose]]) is from Tracadie-Sheila, as is Star Acad&eacute;mie winner [[ASIN:B0000E6EIY Wilfred Bouthillier]]. One reason I love Reichs' books is because I lived in Qu&eacute;bec and majored in Qu&eacute;bec Studies, and she effortlessly manages to work in in-the-know elements of modern Quebecois culture. No mention of Breau or Wilfred, but Garou's [[ASIN:B0000501CN Seul]] makes an appearance (in the first Temperance Brennan novel D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead, it was Roch Voisine's [[ASIN:B000NJM4M0 Helene]]).<br /><br />Tempe's on-again, off-again romance with Detective Ryan is definitely off-again here. Ryan has his hands full with cold cases and personal problems, and although the two consult each other, there's precious little romantic involvement this time around. However, the vibrant cast of supporting characters fills the void.<br /><br />As usual, there are dark subject matters here that may offend some, including post mortems and torture, exploitation and rape of minors, so consider yourself warned. The dialogue is witty and balanced, the pacing generally impeccable, although the ending seemed a tad rushed. Unlike some of the past few Tempe novels, I felt that this was an excellent effort that was truer in spirit to some of the first few Reichs novels. It generally doesn't stray from the realm of believability, and Reichs' expertise as a forensic anthropologist and her experiences living in Qu&eacute;bec lend Tempe an unshakable credibility.",Positive
"In recent years, I've been growing more and more disheartened at the inevitability of escaping ""Made In China"" labels. I've launched my own sort of Chinese boycott in recent years, and gladly pay more for American- and European-made goods if it means avoiding China's far-reaching economic grasp. When I heard about ""A Year Without Made In China"" and saw Sara Bongiorni interviewed on CNN, I ran out to pick up a copy to see if her observations on buying Chinese-free meshed with my own.<br /><br />Sara Bongiorni's family spent one year in a boycott of Chinese-made goods, and ""A Year Without Made In China"" chronicles the author's eye-opening journey into the Chinese incursions on American manufacturing and investment. She already expects that certain items such as shoes, electronics, and small appliances come from China, but so do birthday candles, printer cartridges, humane mouse traps, plastic bags at the grocery store, lamp switches, hardware, craft supplies, and holiday decorations. The book includes a nifty index if you want to see the extent of China's influence looming over our daily lives.<br /><br />It is especially salient in light of the recent numbers of toxic Chinese products that have been recalled: children's toys full of lead paint and dangerous magnets (80% of toys in the US are made in China), flammable and poisonous clothing (a recent report in New Zealand found formaldehyde present at 900 times the ""safe"" level), toxic toothpaste and counterfeit medicines, and poisoned pet food responsible for the death of thousands of cats and dogs. Bongiorni's book does not address the issue of Chinese recalls; this would make an excellent follow-up investigative report, along with a topic she briefly touches on: Chinese food in our grocery stores (Sara was horrified at her weekly purchases of Mandarin oranges when she realized where they came from). Because most foods do not tell where individual ingredients come from, Chinese-made ingredients are virtually impossible to identify (take the recent Veggie Booty recall using salmonella-tainted seasoning powder from China).<br /><br />Bongiorni makes it clear from the start that she's not out to ""get"" China; in fact, she has a distant Chinese ancestor, Mr. Chang, who immigrated to Germany. Nor does her boycott have anything to do with ""Free Tibet"" politics, or as a commentary on how the Chinese government treats workers in its sweatshop factories. It is not pointing a finger at the environmental rape, industrial pollution, and global warming that China is contributing to. Instead, Sara and her family (husband Kevin and two young children) want to see if it is even possible to live without bringing China into their home as a simple economic experiment.<br /><br />The boycott hits hardest for Sara's two young children, toddlers Wes and Sophie. She finds it impossible to explain the boycott to four-year-old Wes, who is constantly asking for green plastic light swords, robots, and ""mote katrol"" (remote control) trucks. She also has a gargantuan task in finding non-Chinese toys for Wes to take to birthday parties, and Christmas shopping is similarly fraught with Chinese toy peril. Sara spends hundreds of dollars on a German dollhouse family that seems woefully inadequate to modern kid sensibilities.<br /><br />At the end of the experiment, Sara finds that her husband Kevin, the one she's dubbed The Weakest Link for smuggling Chinese contraband into their China-free house, is in favor of continuing the boycott. They eventually discard this as impractical, since it would leave them with no way to repair broken appliances, but it did make the Bongiorni family much more thoughtful as to where their merchandise came from.<br /><br />Yes, it's still possible to find non-Chinese goods, but it requires diligent label reading, spending more money (Sara's husband Kevin is surprised to discover that France's tourist trade is becoming as Chinese as the US), and many annoyed salespeople (her conversations with catalog customer service are priceless). In light of the dozens of hazardous recalls of Chinese products, maybe everyone should read (and try!) ""A Year Without Made In China.""",Positive
"I first heard about Barbara Kingsolver's (author of [[ASIN:0060786507 The Poisonwood Bible: A Novel (Perennial Classics)]]) Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life on NPR, where it had been selected as a summer must-read. As someone who shops organic at local farmer markets, this book struck a chord with me on many levels and reinforced why I chose a vegetarian lifestyle. Although I'm not currently in a position to have my own garden, I support local organic Texas produce as much as possible and strive to eat in season. I've been vegetarian for years, and Animal, Vegetable, Miracle was like sitting down for a chat with a good friend over a cup of tea.<br /><br />Due to modern ""convenience"", many of us have forgotten what real produce tastes like. Americans are notorious for not eating our vegetables (unless you count French fries and ketchup). We expect to be able to find any fruit or vegetable at any time of the year in our local grocery stores, but how many of us calculate the cost in carbon credits, pesticides, loss of habitat and deforestation that comes with it? It is such a simple gesture to buy locally from a farmers market or organic grocery store, and you're not just benefiting yourself, but helping to support the gargantuan efforts of small organic farms in your community.<br /><br />Barbara and her family (husband Steven and daughters Camille and Lily) move from Tucson to rural Virginia, where their odyssey of producing all of their food begins. The family makes a vow not to buy any out-of-season, conventional produce at the grocery store. Adios, South American bananas. Farewell, raisins. The Kingsolvers will be responsible stewards of the earth, growing most of their food needs in their garden. This includes not only in-season vegetables, herbs, and fruits, but also eggs and poultry.  The few things that they are unable to produce (organic grain, fair trade coffee, olive oil, spices), they attempt to buy organically, as close to home as possible. Barbara flips lustfully through seed catalogs the way some treat Victoria Secret; she makes notes on alluring new seeds and exotic varieties of produce to try (Australian blue pumpkins and ratlike French fingerling potatoes among them).<br /><br />She encourages her two daughters to take part in the cooking and storing of mountains of tomatoes, zucchini, and herbs in order to store them for the long winter. Everyone pitches in at dinnertime and during holiday menus. Barbara's youngest daughter Lily becomes an entrepreneur saving up for a horse. Her product: organic eggs. She chooses various varieties of chickens to produce a rainbow of eggshell colors, as well as chickens that lay in cold weather. Her cartons of eggs go for $2.50. Barbara's husband is the bread baker, responsible for daily creations that incorporate various flours and healthful additions such as flaxseed. Family mealtime, that great vanished American ritual, has found a new home in the Kingsolvers.<br /><br />Along the way, Barbara divulges fascinating insider's tips on turkey sex life, dispatching poultry from barnyard to table, locking cars to avoid unwanted zucchini deposits from neighbors, and rediscovers the spiritual joy of working the land and living off of her labors.<br /><br />The book also includes numerous excellent recipes for in-season produce and impressive lists of resources, references, and organizations for further research.<br /><br />My only hope is that millions of Americans read this and discover the urgency of preserving our vanishing heirloom vegetables, fruits, and livestock, and the desperate need to economically support local organic farmers.",Positive
"Native Texan Rebecca Rather decided to move her Austin bakery to the delightful Hill Country town of Fredericksburg, and local legend Rather Sweet was born. A self-taught pastry chef, Rebecca baked her way through childhood and adolescence, decided that she had to find a ""real"" (non-food) job after college, eventually went into the catering business (where she burned out two Thermador ovens in her home kitchen), was an executive pastry chef for Tony Vallone in Houston, and found her greatest happiness having her own bakery.<br /><br />Rather Sweet serves a full gamut of baked goods, from sweet and savory kolaches, giant Texas muffins, and scones at breakfast to hearty entrees such as All-Sold-Out Chicken Pot Pie, sandwiches and quesadillas. The Pastry Queen captures all of these Texas-influenced recipes in their down-home goodness, lovingly captured in mouthwatering photographs and atmospheric pictures taken at the Rather Sweet Bakery and Caf�. Each recipe is personalized with an introduction by Rebecca about the origins of the recipe, possible substitutions, or a favorite memory attached to the dish.<br /><br />Many of the breakfast recipes for quick breads and muffins also give conversions for muffins (both regular and Texas-size). Several of the cakes do as well, which is perfect for birthdays and coworkers (it's less messy to bring in individually frosted cupcakes than fuss with cutting and serving a frosted cake!).<br /><br />If you're a scone lover, prepare to be delighted. Rather includes standards such as Peach Jam scones and Chocolate Chip Scones, but also includes savory options such as Apple-Smoked Bacon and Cheddar. Muffin lovers will rejoice at the Essence of Orange and Whole Lemon muffins, and the Eddie's Autumn Pumpkin Bread and Fresh Ginger-Pear Quick Bread will wake up your taste buds in a flash!<br /><br />Rather has also written [[ASIN:1580087906 The Pastry Queen Christmas: Big-hearted Holiday Entertaining, Texas Style]], but there are plenty of seasonal recipes perfect for your next Thanksgiving celebration, such as the Autumn Pumpkin Quick Bread, Bourbon Pumpkin Tart with Streusel Topping, Cream-Filled Pumpkin Roll, and Larger-Than-Life Praline Cheesecake.<br /><br />Texan cuisine also make an appearance, including Hill Country Peach Cobbler, Peach Queen Cake with Dulce De Leche Buttercream Frosting, Buttermilk Pecan Pie, Southern Comfort Apple Pie, Texas Tortilla Soup, Brie and Brisket Quesadillas, Gorditas, and Nuevo Texas Waldorf Salad.<br /><br />Tex-Mex and Mexican influences abound in the divine Mexican Chocolate Fudge-Pecan Cake rich with cinnamon and vanilla, Dulce de Leche Arborio Rice Pudding, Muchas Leches Cake with Sugared Almonds, and Dulce de Leche Macaroons.<br /><br />If you're looking for more traditional fare, there's Espresso Creme Brulee, Tiramisu with Homemade Ladyfingers, Mars Pies and Grasshopper Pie, but with the Texas-sized bounty of creative desserts, why not try something new?<br /><br />The recipes are clearly laid out and easy to follow. Helpful tips are sprinkled throughout, along with ideas for presentation. There are some truly spectacular desserts here (sky-high meringues, Tuxedo Cake, etc.), but all are manageable for novice cooks.<br /><br />Be warned: this is not a book for those thinking about going on a diet! The recipes are loaded with butter, cream, sugar, and other indulgences; in Rebecca's own words, ""I don't do low-fat desserts. If I am going to eat dessert, I want it to be really, really sinful.""",Positive
"Minutemeals has created a winner in Minutemeals Vegetarian. It has compiled 80 vegetarian (NOT vegan) menus that can be put together in 20 minutes, perfect for the hectic weeknight cook.<br /><br />You prepare the entree with the help of store-bought convenience foods such as hard-boiled eggs from the salad bar, pre-sliced veggies, and pre-washed salad greens, and round out the meal with other convenience foods -- store-bought bread, cookies, etc.<br /><br />The book is divided into five chapters: sandwich and pizza menus, soup and stew menus, main-dish salad menus, egg and vegetable menus, and pasta and grain menus.<br /><br />A sample menu is Warm pita pockets with mushroom and zucchini frittata, tomato, feta, and basil salad, and chocolate pudding with pecans. You assemble the frittata, and while it is cooking, you make the salad. For dessert, you simply spoon the refrigerated chocolate pudding into bowls and top with pecans. What could be easier? (Healthier, definitely. Easier? Not by much.)<br /><br />I loved the inclusion of ethnic vegetarian menus such as white gazpacho from Spain, avoglemono stew from Greece, and Indian-inspired curried rice and vegetables. There are also numerous Middle Eastern-inspired recipes such as Lentil salad with goat cheese, olives, and oranges, and Bulghur with currants, chickpeas, and zucchini.<br /><br />The ingredients are clearly listed and divided into two categories: ""shopping list,"" and ""from your pantry."" ""From your pantry"" includes staples like butter, eggs, salt and pepper, herbs, and olive oil. If an item is to be pre-sliced, it tells you what area of the store to find it in (""Presliced button mushrooms from the produce department""). At the top of each recipe (each is conveniently spread across two pages) is a hint or tip from one of the Minutemeals chefs. Also included is a ""Lucky for You"" blurb at the bottom of the left-hand page that gives pointers on how to prepare meals quickly. Step-by-step instructions are highlighted in the middle of the page, so you always know what you should be working on at a given moment in order to have all the components ready at the same time.<br /><br />There is also a nutritional analysis for each menu, but it only covers the entree, not the store-bought sides, which can be confusing at first glance. Also, most of the recipes are loaded with butter and fat, often 25 g or more a serving, so if you're looking for an easy-to-prepare, low-fat vegetarian cookbook, check out Donna Klein's excellent [[ASIN:1557884382 The PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) Vegetarian Cookbook: 240 Healthy and Easy No-Prep Recipes for Busy Cooks]].",Positive
"Do you love Italian food, but are tired of greasy, unhealthy versions in restaurants? Looking to lighten up on fat and cholesterol? A vegan or vegetarian looking for authentic Italian without strange soy meat substitutes?<br /><br />Enter Donna Klein's Vegan Italiano. Author of The[[ASIN:1557883599 The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen]], [[ASIN:1557884382 The PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) Vegetarian Cookbook: 240 Healthy and Easy No-Prep Recipes for Busy Cooks]], and the [[ASIN:1557885109 The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen: Delicious and Nutritious Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free Dishes]], Klein writes easy-to-follow, delicious vegan recipes that, best of all, are free of strange soy substitutes like TVP crumbles, soy sausage, tofu or tempeh. Only garden-fresh natural ingredients are used, with a touch of olive oil for flavor.<br /><br />Naturally, Italian standards such as bruschetta, minestrone, gnocchi, and lasagna are included. Bruschettas include Asparagus, Apulian-Style with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil, and Cherry Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper. Lasagnas include Spinach and Eggplant and Zucchini. The main part of the book is dedicated, not surprisingly, to pasta, with numerous farfalle, linguine, and fusili offerings. There are also numerous ideas for fresh wild greens salads, vegetable side dishes, pizzas and breads, and desserts. Many of the dessert offerings would be perfect on a hot summer's day on the patio: fruits poached in red and white wine, macedonias, and granitas.<br /><br />The great thing about vegan Italian recipes is that they're delicious as written, but if you want to add cheese, feel free. It's much easier to add animal products to a successful vegan recipe than it is to subtract them from a traditional one.<br /><br />The majority of recipes are easy to prepare and contain detailed nutritional info. Fans of Donna Klein's other vegan and vegetarian cookbooks, as well as those looking for healthier updates on authentic Italian cuisine, will do well to check out Vegan Italiano. Although not as thorough as Klein's Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen (much of Vegan Italiano felt like carryovers from MVK), these are still healthy, delicious Italian favorites that are easy to prepare.",Positive
"Maggie Glezer's labor of love ""A Blessing of Bread: The Many Rich Traditions of Jewish Bread Baking Around The World"" is truly that: a blessing. Not just a survey of Ashkenazi, Sephardic, North African, and Near Eastern breadmaking traditions, she also sprinkles in family stories, folktales, Yiddish proverbs, and prayers, including a section on the mitzvah of challah.<br /><br />In addition to providing the blessing for Challah, Glezer also includes the Hebrew Shabbat blessings of the washing of hands and Hamotzi (Blessing of Bread).<br /><br />On to the recipes themselves: divided by region, there are numerous challahs, from the relatively plain Lithuanian Challah (no sugar or eggs) to Doris Koplin's Sweet Challah, liberally glazed with confectioner's sugar, maraschino cherries, raisins, and pecans. For those of you who enjoy working with sourdough, nearly every recipe has a sourdough version available. Although I've yet to experiment with sourdough starters, I appreciated the versatility.<br /><br />In addition to challah, there are also yeast breads like the Polish coffeecake Babka, an onion and poppyseed Purim ring, onion rounds, bagels, and Hungarian walnut and poppyseed pastries. From the Sephardic tradition, we have the Churek, Greek walnut and currant rolls, and the intriguing Pan de Calabaza (Pumpkin bread). North African recipes include whole wheat Sabbath Bereketei, the incredibly ornate Chubzeh, and Rarif (Egyptian Cheese Rolls). From the East, Persian and Iraqi flatbreads, pitas, several Yemenite recipes for pancakes and smoked preserved butter, Israeli matzoh, and Syrian and Iraqi pastries.<br /><br />The preface also includes an incredibly detailed guide to braiding challah, from a simple single strand braid to a challenging nine-strand compound braid, along with folkloric shapes like little birds, braided wreaths, pinwheels, key challah, ladder challah for Shavuot, and hand challah.",Positive
"In people with celiac disease, gluten (the protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) triggers an autoimmune reaction that causes repeated damage to the villi in the small intestines, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients and painful gastrointestinal side effects. As someone with multiple autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's disease and suspected celiac disease), I have followed a vegetarian (and occasionally vegan) diet for the past four years in an attempt to try and improve my health. As soon as I heard that Donna Klein was writing a vegetarian gluten-free cookbook, I rushed out to buy a copy.<br /><br />I am the happy owner of three of Donna Klein's other veg cookbooks, [[ASIN:1557884382 The PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) Vegetarian Cookbook: 240 Healthy and Easy No-Prep Recipes for Busy Cooks]], [[ASIN:1557883599 The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen]] and [[ASIN:1557884943 Vegan Italiano: Meat-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free Dishes from Sun-Drenched Italy]], and have long relied on Ms. Klein's simple and authentically delicious vegetarian cuisine that's (mostly) free of soy (I'm allergic to soy as well). She also includes detailed nutritional info, cultural background, tasty variations, and sample menus.<br /><br />The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen begins with a thorough introduction on gluten, where it is found, and what products to avoid, including ""hidden"" sources of gluten such as dressings, baking powder, spices, low-fat dairy, flavored coffees, and more. If you've recently been diagnosed, this is a very handy guide to lesser-known gluten traps. Thankfully, my town has several excellent supermarkets such as Whole Foods and Central Market that clearly label their gluten-free products and contain a large variety of gluten-free baking products, mixes, and flours. More and more restaurants also provide special gluten-free menus, as one recent estimate places celiac disease at 1 in 133 Americans.<br /><br />Another wonderful feature of The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen is that it clearly labels recipes as Lacto-Ovo, Egg-Free, Dairy-Free, and Vegan. As many with celiac disease are also lactose intolerant, this made planning around wheat-free AND dairy-free a breeze. Klein also offers practical vegan substitutions whenever practical, in most cases by omitting the cheese or sour cream called for in the original recipe.<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges in gluten-free cuisine is the absence of wheat products in baking. Instead of wheat flours (including bread flour, cake flour, whole wheat, semolina, barley, and spelt), expensive gluten-free alternatives (tapioca, quinoa, soy, potato, chickpea, cornmeal, buckwheat, sorghum, rice flours, nut flours and stabilizer gums such as xanthan) are used. Klein does include a chapter on baked goods including quick breads, muffins, and biscuits, but due to my personal tastes, I've steered away from GF breads altogether as they are more labor-intensive, more expensive, and more calorically dense than their wheat counterparts.<br /><br />Similar to her other vegan cookbooks, The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen is a breeze to follow; if you can read, you can cook. Ms. Klein's instructions are logical and walk you through each step of the recipe. The included nutritional analysis is much appreciated as I watch my fat and sodium intake very carefully.<br /><br />And the recipes themselves? Divided into the standard appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, and desserts, Ms. Klein rounds out her selections with breads, pizzas, tacos and sandwiches, side dishes, brunch and egg dishes. What really makes The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen shine is the inclusion of numerous world cuisines including Asian (Thai, Japanese, Indian), Mexican, Caribbean, Mediterranean, and Italian. The touches of international flair elevate gluten-free vegetarian cuisine from ordinary to extraordinary, and are a pleasant departure from Ms. Klein's normally Mediterranean vegan cuisine.<br /><br />I was instantly torn between several recipes, but ultimately decided on Caribbean-Style Sweet Potatoes and Black Beans over Brown Rice (p. 125), a saucy blend of orange juice, jerk seasoning, cinnamon, cumin, black beans and cubed sweet potatoes, as my first entr'e. Other personal favorites include Kasha Pilaf with Eggplant, Tomatoes, Basil, and Olives (p. 105), Feta and Ricotta Stuffed Bell Peppers (p. 104), Arborio Rice with Tomatoes and Fresh Mozzarella (p. 119), Chili-Brown Rice Casseroles (p. 100), and Mexican Cornmeal Pie (p. 100).<br /><br />There is something here to appeal to everyone, from Tex-Mex appetizers such as the zesty Mexican Deviled Eggs (p. 15) and Salsa Cheesecake (p. 24) to filling Indian curries. Sweet tooths (teeth?) rejoice: there are numerous satisfying gluten-free desserts including the delightful No-Cook Apple Pie (p. 176), which features a walnut-and-date crust and a fresh combination of raw apples, raisins, and cinnamon and nutmeg, the delightfully exotic (and easy!) Indonesian-Style Warm Bananas in Cinnamon-Coconut Milk (p. 177), Cardamom Sponge Cake with Strawberry Coulis (p. 182), Hawaiian Coconut Cake (p. 188), and Polenta Chocolate-Currant Cake (p. 193) that will have your non-celiac friends oohing and ahhing over the amazing versatility of gluten-free cuisine.<br /><br />Overall, the Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen is an empowering tool; it showcases the versatility and creativity of gluten-free vegetarian cuisine rather than emphasizing an already restrictive diet. This is a statement of pride and originality - your gluten-eating carnivorous friends will be amazed at these full-flavored, simple international dishes that make the most of beans, legumes, gluten-free grains, and fresh produce. Who knows? You may even convert a few of your friends after cooking them the delightful recipes found within.",Positive
"After being vegetarian (and occasionally vegan) for four years, it never fails to amaze me that carnivores think that we herbivores are depriving ourselves of delicious foods.<br /><br />One need only flip through Donna Klein's ""Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen"" to revel in the astounding variety of appetizers, soups, salads, sides, breads and desserts, all of which are vegan (meat-free, dairy-free, and animal byproduct-free). As a pleasant side effect, many recipes are also gluten-free as well, making them ideal for those with Celiac disease or gluten intolerance (Donna Klein has written a new cookbook,  [[ASIN:1557885109 The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen: Delicious and Nutritious Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free Dishes]], that focuses specifically on gluten-free vegetarian cuisine).

Her 1991 work Living A Jewish Life has been given a much-needed cosmetic facelift, both in appearance (the typeface and Hebrew are much easier to read) and the addition of an updated bibliography and online resources. I had the opportunity to review the original 1991 release and the 2007 update side-by-side, and these are my observations:<br /><br />+ First, a new preface that addresses the vast diversity of modern Judaism, as well as the author's own upbringing by Holocaust survivors (she considers herself a Jew-by-choice and only truly began to explore her heritage in her late 20s).<br /><br />+ The Table of Contents has been greatly streamlined, with fewer subheadings. Also, some of the subchapters have been renamed : Shabbat and Soccer (1991) has become Shabbat in the Real World (2007), for example.<br /><br />+ The typeface is slightly larger and easier to read. Quotations from the Torah and Talmud are less intrusive on the text than in the original. And the Hebrew text is much easier to read.<br /><br />+ Graphics have been added to the top of chapters.<br /><br />+ Many of the mail addresses (which took up a whole chapter in the original) have been replaced with websites.<br /><br />""Living a Jewish Life"" provides thorough descriptions of the Jewish calendar, holidays, the Jewish lifecycle, keeping kosher, Jewish community organizations, Jewish education, recommended home libraries, and conversion and adoption.

"Over the past decade, a curious new literary genre has emerged: that of the American writer seeking a bucolic existence in Europe. Such novels generally involve the writer in question purchasing a run-down villa, and then chronicling the restoration stone by stone. Frances Mayes's ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" set off an avalanche of similarly themed Tuscan memoirs, some more pompous than others, waxing poetic on the mystical quality of the Tuscan light, the sensual delights of Tuscan produce, etc.<br /><br />Enter The Reluctant Tuscan. Phil Doran was practically dragged to Tuscany from L.A. Although his wife has spent several years in Italy working as a sculptor, Phil has no desire to restore the crumbling heap that his wife purchased in a moment of ""inspiration."" Add to that feuding neighbors, an uncooperative bureaucracy, and Phil's fading career as a sitcom writer/producer, and at first glance you think, ""Under the Tuscan Sun Part V.""<br /><br />Don't be so quick to judge. Doran revitalizes the genre by a new twist: humor, and lots of it, in the biting style of Dave Barry (or travel host Rick Steves's witty observations). He pokes fun at Italian stereotypes of Americans and vice versa, of the rough-and-tumble country neighbors, the oddities of working in Hollywood, and his own transformation from stressed-out American yuppie to being in tune with his Tuscan side.<br /><br />The book is an enjoyable read, and just when you think that the next page is predictable, something comes along to shake up the story. Although Doran writes extensively about his career, I never found the story to descend into a self-centered memoir. There are valuable insights on marriage and relationships, the stress of being replaced by a younger generation at work, of learning a new language and way of life, and embracing the unknown. The novel's ultimate message is don't be afraid to take a chance...the journey is more important that the destination.",Positive
"I'm a longtime fan of Dave Barry, and although I can't claim to understand all of the Baby Boomer cultural references (I'm a Generation Xer myself), ""The Shepherd, the Angel, and Walter the Christmas Miracle Dog"" was a quick, enjoyable read that put me in the holiday spirit.<br /><br />However, this semi-autobiographical tale smacked of other, earlier Christmas-gone-wacky classics such as Jean Sheppard's ""A Christmas Story,"" ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and Barbara Robinson's ""The Best Christmas Pageant Ever."" And half of this *very* slim offering (Christmas lite??) is taken up by vintage photos.<br /><br />Older children will likely get a laugh out of the irreverent humor (leave it to Barry to work in scatological references to bat guano in a Christmas story), Doug's crush on a classmate, and familiar love story of a boy and his dog. There are laugh-out-loud moments to be found here, but Barry banks more on the nostalgia factor of a bygone era and familiar set pieces (the charming alternative lyrics to ""We Three Kings"" involving a rubber cigar) to create a ""Christmas Story"" mood of a dysfunctional suburban Christmas.<br /><br />For us grownups, this is a pleasant jaunt down memory lane that's sure to delight Dave Barry fans and any of us who need a little Christmas spirit to brighten our day. Happy Holidays!",Positive
"Having recently relocated to San Antonio and finding a lack of bakeries, I purchased a Cuisinart convection breadmaker. Although the Cuisinart CBK-200 comes with a decent set of recipes, many are laden with fat (with 30% or more of calories coming from added oil, butter, nuts, etc.) and sugars. I try to eliminate oils, fats, sugar and salt from my diet, so I was looking for a healthier alternative to home breadmaking.<br /><br />Enter The Best Low-Fat, No-Sugar Bread Machine Cookbook. Added fats have been replaced by lean, fruit- and veggie-based alternatives such as unsweetened apple butter, applesauce, minced prunes, and mashed sweet and white potatoes. Sugars such as molasses and honey are replaced by dried fruits (raisins, currants, cherries). Sun-dried tomatoes, zucchini, corn, carrots, kale, and onions are among the many veggies that make a guest appearance.<br /><br />Although I was doubtful that these healthy, lean (less than 5% calories from fat) breads would be tasty, I have tried three loaves thus far and all were sensational. My first loaf was the Butternut Squash and Balsamic Vinegar loaf (page 51). I substituted canned pumpkin for the squash and dried cherries for the raisins, and the loaf was pleasantly sweet, with an orange color but not an overwhelmingly pumpkin-y taste.<br /><br />My second loaf was a breakfast bread (Oat and Raisin Bread, page 35). Although I only made a one-pound loaf, the bread was so light and airy that it was nearly as big as a large loaf. Both the Butternut Squash and Oat and Raisin bread are delicious toasted in the morning.<br /><br />My third loaf was made to accompany soups: lentil bread, with a hearty helping of cooked lentils and Mediterranean flavors courtesy of sage and sea salt. Denser than the first two breads I baked, the lentil bread is a savory, hearty accompaniment to soups and sandwiches.<br /><br />Although one reviewer mentioned a disasterous loaf of zucchini bread, I am brand new to breadmaking (my first loaf ever was from this cookbook) and have had nothing but success. It's important to add ingredients in the order recommended by your breadmaker: usually liquids first (at room temperature, except for water, which should be between 80-90 degrees), then flours and seasonings, and finally the yeast. The directions are straightforward and easy to follow. Several breads require finishing in the oven (low-fat challah, whole wheat baguettes, pitas). Besides low-fat, no sugar added recipes, the book also includes a chapter on salt-free breads (but not gluten-free).<br /><br />The Best Low-Fat, No-Sugar Bread Machine Cookbook Ever truly lives up to its name. Although over ten years old, the recipes work beautifully with my brand new, circa 2006 bread machine. Thankfully, the ingredients are fairly common, with some alternative grains and flours (amaranth, quinoa, barley, rye) called for to add variety. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves bread but is looking to lighten up on refined sugars, oils, and salt; these recipes offer all of the taste with none of the guilt.",Positive
"Although I dabbled in art during my formative years, I never rose to the level of ""artist."" That didn't stop me from falling in love with the genre I've dubbed ""historical art fiction,"" however. In recent years, talented authors have treated us to the stories behind the paintings, including those by Vermeer (""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" by Tracy Chevalier, and ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"" by Susan Vreeland), Leonardo Da Vinci (""Leonardo's Swans"" by Karen Essex), and Artemisia Gentileschi (Susan Vreeland).<br /><br />In ""The Painted Kiss,"" Elizabeth Hickey plunges the reader into the beautiful, hectic world of turn-of-the-century Vienna, in full Art Nouveau swing. Her debut novel traces the backstory of Gustav Klimt's famous ""Painted Kiss,"" in which a man and woman pause during an intimate moment of quiet rapture. Her narrator is Emilie Floge, one of Klimt's many lovers, and the novel begins with twelve-year-old Emilie's first glimpse of the Klimt twins as they paint during the emperor's visit.<br /><br />Emilie is fascinated by Klimt, and her father secures drawing lessons with the maestro. Although she possesses some artistic talent, she knows that she will never be great at drawing, and instead turns to the world of fashion. The novel cuts between World Wars, with an elderly Emilie in exile sewing blackout curtains and awaiting the fall of Vienna. The colors, sights and sounds of Vienna's teahouses and concert halls are brought to life in a riot of fabrics, smells and sound.<br /><br />Over the years, Emilie realizes that Klimt's wandering streak (including many mistresses and illegitimate children) is part of his nature, along with his bouts of melancholy and depression over his brother's untimely death. She also knows that Klimt will never exclusively be hers, but decides to take each moment she is given. Emilie becomes a renowned designer in her own right, but as tastes change, so do the clients' demands, and she eventually falls out of fashion before the start of the war.<br /><br />A fascinating glimpse of the privileged world of fin-de-siecle Vienna and the unglamorous world of its artists, contrasting with the stark isolation and poverty that WWII brings, ""The Painted Kiss"" is a luminous debut and a welcome addition to historical art fiction.",Positive
"I first discovered Bruce Feiler from reading his ""Learning to Bow: Inside the Heart of Japan"" in preparation for the JET Program. Being a longtime fan of the circus, when I saw ""Under the Big Top,"" I couldn't resist. Bruce's humorous writing style (think an overeducated Dave Barry - Feiler has degrees from Yale and Cambridge) chronicles a season spent with the Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus, the largest tented circus in the world. He cleverly works in the fact that most circus novels (he makes thinly veiled references to Angela Carter's ""Nights at the Circus"" and Katherine Dunn's ""Geek Love"") deal with the fantastic (half-swan half-woman) and horrific (circus freaks seeking revenge), but not the day-to-day lives of the performers and crew (one notable exception is the excellent ""The Circus In Winter"" by Cathy Day).<br /><br />Bruce acts on his lifelong desire to be a clown (he had a previous history of theatre at Yale and of miming), and is tossed into the testosterone-fuelled world of the circus's Clown Alley, where he meets an assortment of lively characters (most with criminal records) and some sexual deviants. He quickly becomes acquainted with his circus ""family"": the performers (acrobats, lion tamers, human cannonball), and brings the reader along on a fascinating journey into a vanishing world (confrontations with animal rights groups become more and more frequent as the season progresses). The narrative is slightly choppy, due to the present description of action in the ring that dissolves into a past narrative, then back, but ""Under the Big Top"" is sure to please young-at-heart fans of the circus with its menagerie of unique personalities and talents that would be out of place in the ""real world.""",Positive
"I'm currently finishing up a master's degree in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), and checked out ""Teaching English Overseas"" to aid me in my job quest. It is absolutely loaded with helpful information, from choosing a TEFL certificate/TESOL program, to how to market yourself overseas(including a step-by-step guide to creating an ESL resume), preparing for interviews, researching your potential employers, where to find jobs, and what to expect.<br /><br />In addition, there are sections devoted to job outlooks by region (very few opportunities in EU countries for those without an EU passport, although thousands of North Americans teach illegally, limited jobs in parts of Africa and the Middle East). Your best bet is to try for former Eastern Bloc countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, etc.) and Asia (Japan, China, Taiwan, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam). Mexico is also a good source for those looking for something closer to home.<br /><br />""Teaching English Overseas"" also includes sections devoted to legalities, practicalities, and health concerns, dealing with culture shock, your first weeks overseas, and a very thorough appendix that covers TEFL certificate programs in Canada, the USA, and abroad, along with TEFL books, lists of overseas employers (with email and addresses), TEFL job websites, international programs and employers, and a ""test your knowledge of English"" section to give you an idea of what grammar points employers expect you to be able to explain.<br /><br />This is an absolute necessity for anyone considering teaching English abroad, whether you have no TEFL experience or you already have an advanced TESOL degree.",Positive
"Dario Castagno is a born Tuscan. Raised in London until he was ten, Dario's fluency in English and love of Tuscany, including exploring abandoned farmhouses and villas like the one in Frances Mayes' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and his experiences working in a Chianti winery, led him to create Chianti Black Rooster Tours. Dario gives personalized tours of the Chianti region to groups up to six, and in ""Too Much Tuscan Sun"" he chronicles seasonal life in Tuscany, cultural gems, and the all-too-often bizarre and demanding American tourists that he is saddled with.<br /><br />Dario wrote the book as a rebuttal of Frances Mayes and other American writers who paint a dreamy portrait of Tuscany peppered with the notion of ""aren't the Tuscans backwards and quaint!"" when they run into un-American customs or try to ""act American"" and are misunderstood. Dario offers a moving account of the Palio and tragic events in WWII Italy, misunderstandings with Americans as presented by the Italian point of view, and an eye-opening chapter on the death penalty in America as reported by  Italian media.<br /><br />The book is arranged chronologically over the course of a year from February to December, with various interludes thrown in. Dario paints a lyrical picture of the various seasonal changes that occur in Tuscany's gardens and landscapes, the power of a passing thunderstorm, and the bounty of crops each season yields, along with mouthwatering descriptions of local Tuscan cuisine. Mixed in are remembrances of his rebellious psychedelic teenage years in Tuscany and earlier (brief) encounters with American college students studying abroad in Italy.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is devoted to poking fun at the obnoxious stereotypical American tourists that booked Dario's tours: yelling as though Dario can't understand English, wearing large, gaudy, flashy jewelry, leopard prints and stiletto heels for sightseeing in the country, asking why Italians are speaking Italian (!), only eating at McDonald's because Italians can't cook Italian food like they do in America, claiming that caffe lattes and pizza are American culinary creations that the Italians confiscated, refusing to walk anywhere on a walking tour...the list goes on. There are several couples that are presented as happy, easygoing, and well adjusted, but overall the book tends to paint a negative picture of the American (and Canadian!) tourist in Tuscany. Although it reads humorously, it felt nigh stereotypical, but understandably; others of lesser means who may be more in tune with Italian culture probably can't afford to hire Dario and travel Italy in five-star hotels.<br /><br />A very engaging read, but if Dario pens a sequel, please make it the adventures you've had with laid-back, adventurous, polite Americans who enjoy throwing themselves into Italian language and culture. I felt as though I were being punished via the hoards of loud, barbaric, stereotypical American tourists when, in fact, I can understand some Italian (I regularly listen to Italian pop music), I love to walk everywhere, and can deal with any change in plans with grace and enthusiasm. As a language- and culture-conscious tourist, I felt woefully underrepresented, but enjoyed Dario's in-depth cultural and gastronomic tour of Tuscany immensely (although I lived in Spain on two occasions, I've yet to visit Italy) and hope to one day tour the marvels of Tuscany for myself.",Positive
"Leonard Kniffel grew up in Michigan with a Polish grandmother who immigrated as a young woman. This instantly resonated, as my grandmother also immigrated from Poland as a child, and many of his memories of large Polish family gatherings, Polish mass, and family life rung so true to my own. At twenty-five, I am finally embracing my Polish heritage, in no small part inspired by this book. Leonard lands in Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, the town near where his grandmother is born, and quickly makes a network of local friends: Adam, a local entrepreneur and his new landlord, the elegant and sensual Pani Wituchowska, with her memories of grandeur before the war, local journalists Ryszard and Grazyna, the mayor, and innumerable relatives that he discovers on his quest to trace his grandmother's roots in Sugajno. The touching narrative is filled with bittersweet images of modern Poland, of its Communist legacy and strong will to survive, fervent Catholicism, and the legacy of Jewish indifference: a good part of the novel traces the author's struggle to divine what happened to the headstones in the local Jewish cemeteries, and he is shocked by how the Polish Jewish history seems to have evaporated into thin air. Most importantly, he reconnects with his Polish roots in a visceral way, embracing Polish cuisine (hunting for wild mushrooms in forests with Adam's mother), culture, and storytelling. A wonderful tale of family, friendship, being a stranger in a strange land, and rediscovering the important things in life. Dziekuje bardzo!",Positive
"I'll be the first to admit that the erotic emphasis on the book jacket almost put me off reading this book. I adored Sue Monk Kidd's ""Secret Life of Bees,"" and was drawn in by the Celtic lore of the Mermaid Chair and the natural beauty of Egret Island. Although the central theme of the book is romance, the element of female eroticism is not nearly as strongly played up as the jacket description would have you believe (""Few writers have explored, as Kidd does, the lush, unknown region of the feminine soul where the thin line between the spiritual and the erotic exists. The Mermaid Chair is a vividly imagined novel about the passions of the spirit and the ecstasies of the body"").<br /><br />Jessie Sullivan is a middle-age woman in a midlife crisis. Her carefully maintained suburban life to a dashing psychiatrist begins to come unraveled by a sense of yearning for personal freedom. When Jessie's mother commits a violent act, Jessie must go back to the barrier island where she grew up in order to take care of her aged mother, and finds herself embracing the beauty of the island and seeking a respite from marriage and motherhood (her daughter is a freshman in college). Jessie seeks to understand her mother Nelle's fanatic Catholicism and inexplicable act of self-violence, Nelle's aversion to the Mermaid Chair (the star attraction at a local monastery) and her guilt surrounding her husband's death. Jessie is herself still trying to sort out her deep feelings of guilt surrounding her father's death thirty years ago, believing herself to be the cause. Jessie begins to paint again as well, using her canvases to capture her feelings of uncertainty and blossoming sensuality.<br /><br />Jessie soon meets Brother Thomas, Whit O'Conner in his former life, a middle-aged junior monk about to take his vows to become a permanent monk at the monastery. Whit's wife and unborn child were killed in a highway accident five years ago, and Whit has wandered seeking God and a spiritual revelation ever since. Jessie and Whit experience a powerful attraction that awakens Jessie's dormant eroticism and need for individuality, and Whit experiences a crisis of faith as the two engage in forbidden temptation. The novel's ending seemed anticlimactic, and felt overly melodramatic and none too plausible.<br /><br />This is another example of Southern Chick Lit, playing up the zany, alcohol-fueled Southern belles immortalized in novels such as ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood."" Jessie's clan is rounded out by no-nonsense Kat, her gentle retarded daughter Benne, and Hepzibah, keeper of Gullah and slave traditions, forming a strong female community that supports Jessie during her hour of need, but they also block her quest to discover the dark secret tormenting her mother.<br /><br />A good read for a rainy day, ""The Mermaid Chair"" does have lovingly drawn characters, the natural beauty of the Carolina barrier islands, and deep ponderings on faith, sexuality, and love to recommend it, but the overbearing final confrontation zapped some of the magic for me.",Positive
"Phyllis A. Whitney is the author of a number of excellent mysteries geared at young adults. ""Mystery of the Gulls"" is her first such novel from 1949, and is near and dear to my heart. I spent idyllic childhood summers Up North, running around Petoskey, Harbor Springs, and Mackinac Island, Michigan since I was three years old, scooping up Petoskey stones, buying cheap trinkets, and biking around Mackinac Island. Every summer, I would take my battered copy of ""Mystery of the Gulls"" with me to Mackinac Island, since the novel takes place there.<br /><br />Our heroine is Taffy Saunders of Chicago. Her father was seriously injured in a car accident, and she and her mother have recently inherited an inn on Mackinac Island. The novel begins with Taffy on the ferry to the Island (this was shortly before the Mackinac Bridge was completed), and she soon finds that mystery abounds as something (or someone) tries to frighten the inn's guests so that the Saunders leave. Mysterious events, including gulls tapping at the windows, a gong crashing in the middle of the night, and bones appearing in guests' beds send sleuthing Taffy on the trail, along with her new friend David Marsh. Taffy meets a colourful cast of characters on the Island, including temperamental French-Canadian/Indian cook Celeste, sullen Donna, who dreams of becoming a dancer, and Henry Fox, an Indian boy who serves as a guide for tourists.<br /><br />Taffy must search for clues, leading her to some of Mackinac Island's best-known charms, Fort Mackinac and Arch Rock. This is a quick, enjoyable read (dated, naturally) that will forever be close to my heart from my many summers in Northern Michigan. Fans of Nancy Drew mysteries will enjoy this.",Positive
"Like author Terry Gamble, I spent my childhood summers in the same town as the author in Northern Michigan: the millionaires' summer resort of Harbor Springs, with its lavish ""summer cottages"" (sprawling mansions) and yacht club, inspiration behind her first novel ""The Water Dancers"" and her sophomore effort ""Good Family."" The natural beauty of this area is lovingly brought to life as the setting for a family reunion upon the death of its matriarch. Like the thinly veiled settings of Harbor Point, Harbor Springs, and Petoskey in ""Water Dancers,"" ""Good Family"" seems a juxtaposition of the turn-of-the-century cottages on Mackinac Island, the elegant mansions of Harbor Point, and the turn-of-the-century Methodist summer community of Bay View in Petoskey.<br /><br />The Addison family, made famous by its early pharmaceuticals, owns the Aerie, a sprawling, run-down cottage on Sand Isle, where cars are forbidden and transportation is by horse, carriage, and bicycle. The family's many eccentric relatives are drawn back together at the imminent death of its matriarch.<br /><br />The novel's narrator is Maddie, a struggling filmmaker in New York who is recovering from years of alcoholism and traumatic earlier events. The last place she wants to be is the Aerie, haunted by ghosts both real and imagined. Memories of earlier summers, of her mother's easy elegance and later neglect, of forbidden crushes, of life-altering tragedies all come flooding back, and Maddie must assess where she has come from and where she is going. Maddie, her sister (the faithful, staid Dana) and cousins (the mystic Adele, rebellious adopted Jessica, alcoholic thespian Sedgie, artistic Derek) come together for the first time in a decade to figure out the etiquette of dying. Maddie must tangle with the ghosts of her past and make peace with the events that so drastically altered her life (the death of a child and a divorce, her alcoholism, near-incest), while bringing closure to the family's tumultuous relationship with its matriarch.<br /><br />Clearly, many elements of Ms. Gamble's childhood summers on Harbor Point seem autobiographical: the train rides to Northern Michigan, the sprawling, run-down, once-elegant summer mansions that have fallen into disrepair, the rivalries and vicious backbiting of the country club elite, the flippant disregard to spending large sums of money on keeping up appearances, the inherent racism of an earlier age (the invisibility of the ""colored help,"" black lawn jockeys, etc.), and the Native American mysticism that is as old as the land: the Odawa (Ottawa) tribes that live around Little Traverse Bay, on hard times but still maintaining a cultural presence (a theme explored in more depth in her debut ""The Water Dancers."").<br /><br />As a sophomore follow-up to ""The Water Dancers,"" ""Good Family"" is much improved, featuring a more tightly-knit cast, a seamless interweaving of past and present, and a much stronger, more realistic storyline. Instead of a picture-perfect world of millionaires and easy living, Ms. Gamble's characters wallow in the mundane sorrows of living: a damaged Vietnam vet (cousin Edward, in and out of different institutions until he finally disappears), alcoholism (Maddie, her mother, Sedgie, and her gay best friend Ian), failed relationships, dead babies, and the price of apparent success. The country club lifestyle that so dominates Northern Michigan resort towns is systematically picked apart to reveal its earlier racism, elitism, and falsity of appearances and substance.<br /><br />A spellbinding read that once again transported me to the beautiful landscapes of my childhood, dominated by the cry of gulls, the shifting moods of Lake Michigan, the elegant, faded mansions of Mackinac Island, Bay View and Harbor Point, the small boutiques of Harbor Springs with their colorful striped awnings and resplendent windowboxes of petunias, pansies and impatiens, and the sense of home.",Positive
"""Pomegranate Soup"" follows the lives of three sisters exiled from Iran: the eldest, Marjan, a talented chef, the middle sister Bahar, haunted by an abusive husband and fleeing from a violent past, and the youngest, fifteen-year-old Lalya, who turns heads with her Oriental beauty and mysterious cinnamon and rosewater scent.<br /><br />The three arrive in the sleepy, close-minded Irish village of Ballinacroagh determined to open an Iranian restaurant, which turns out to be exactly what the bland community needs.  The restaurant, though slow to take off, is eventually a success, and the three sisters soon have a network of friends and staunch regulars to defend them from the vicious gossips and bullying Thomas McGuire, who wants to buy out the Babylon Café in order to turn it into a disco.<br /><br />Marjan blossoms, creating an herb and flower garden from nearly barren soil and using her talent in the kitchen to bring a touch of the magical to people's lives: the closet comedian Father Mahoney, who is transformed by Marjan's abgusht, the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico, who takes the girls under her wing and is soothed by the exotic teas served from Marjan's samovar, Fiona Athey, unwilling hairdresser with a thespian past, and Malachy McGuire, Thomas's sensitive Iberian son (product of his wife's fling with a shipwrecked Spanish sailor) who falls in love with Layla.<br /><br />The novel is beautifully written, woven with flashbacks from Revolutionary Iran, wisps of Persian, and sprinkled with delicious-sounding Persian recipes for dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves), red lentil soup, baklava, dugh, abgusht, fritters, lavash bread, torshi, chelow, fesenjoon, a tribal herbal headache remedy (nutmeg, cardamom, cloves), and pomegranate soup, all of which are key players in the novel.<br /><br />A delightful, hunger inducing read in the spirit and tradition of Chocolat and Like Water for Chocolate, ""Pomegranate Soup"" is a magical journey of Irish lore, Persian spices, and the healing powers of love.",Positive
"After longing for ""Mary Engelbreit Cross Stitch for All Seasons,"" but balking at the high price, I eventually picked up a copy for a song in a bargain bin.  I am a longtime fan of Mary Engelbreit's whimsical work, and copies of several of her more famous works (Everyone needs their own Spot, It's Good to be Queen) grace my home.<br /><br />""Cross Stitch For All Seasons"" includes cross stitch adaptations of Engelbreit's signature works such as Everyone Needs Their Own Spot, Believe, and It's Good to be Queen in a variety of uses: as pillows, basket liners, placemats, bookends, button covers, treat bags and more.<br /><br />The book is arranged in four seasons (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer), and projects are grouped accordingly.  Halloween treats include a centerpiece, treat bag, candy corn button covers, basket liners and more.  Spring features handy gifts for the gardener.  Baby and wedding projects are also included, along with ""Breit ideas"" and a handy section on cross-stitch basics.<br /><br />The patterns are easy to read, both in the choice of colors and in the size of the patterns themselves.  I would classify the stitching level as moderately difficult, and based on the numerous color photos of finished projects that grace the book, the patterns are very close to the originals.  Ranging from quick and easy (button covers) to down and dirty (double-layered, matted wedding plaques), this is sure to please any cross-stitcher who loves the timeless art of Mary Engelbreit.",Positive
"I spent three months in the summer of 2005 working in Madrid, and as a longtime fan of Rick Steves' travel show ""Europe Through the Back Door"" on PBS, I bought his Spain 2005 guidebook to accompany me on my weekend trips in and around Madrid, as well as on long-distance treks to Santiago de Compostela and Barcelona.<br /><br />The book focuses on destinations such as Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago, Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada and the Costa del Sur, offering a range of dining and lodging options to suit all tastes and budgets.  Rick includes walking tours, hand-drawn maps to locate dining and hotel listings, and a liberal dose of humour and Spanish culture.<br /><br />Nearly all of my reservations on trips were from Rick's recommendations: in Santiago, I stayed at the Hotel Virxe da Cerca (""a wonderful splurge"") and enjoyed a coffee on the terrace of the Hotel Costa Vella, Rick's favourite hotel in Santiago. In Toledo, I tried two different hotels that Rick recommends: the budget-priced, centrally located Hotel Santa Isabel (45 Euros/night for a double) and the plush, tranquil Hostal del Cardenal, a former cardinal's palace built into the ancient city wall.<br /><br />The only hotel recommendation that I found a little off was the Petit Palace Las Torres in Salamanca.  Rick's prices are drastically off for 2005 - although he lists a single room as 67 Euros, the summer rate was 100.  Rick also lists that rooms with a view cost the same as interior rooms; again, this is no longer true.  A room facing the Plaza Mayor runs about 20-30 Euros more a night.  However, the Las Torres is in an unbeatable location, and despite the huge crowds and summer festival in full swing on the Plaza Mayor, there was virtually no outside noise.  Also, the free Internet came in handy.<br /><br />Rick focuses on museums, with handy descriptions and walkthroughs that are lifesavers for non-Spanish speakers, since nearly all museums have little or no English posted, or limited information in general.  His orientation and transportation information is hugely helpful, down to listing metro stops, where to catch buses/trains to specific destinations, and how to go on foot from bus/train stations to downtown areas, saving in costly taxi fares.<br /><br />Also, his listings of vegetarian restaurants were a lifesaver: as a vegan in Spain, vegetarian options are few and far between, and Rick made it easy to navigate.  I especially enjoyed trying the numerous local pastries and delicacies in each town, such as the ponche segoviano (marzipan cake) in Segovia at the Lima y Menta and the pumpkin-filled toledano marzipan cookies at Santo Tome in Toledo.  I wanted to try the crema catalan at the Granja Viader in Barcelona, but even though I arrived before close (as posted by Rick), the shop had already closed.<br /><br />As expected, many of the museum entrance costs have gone up since the book's publication, usually by no more than .50 - 2.00 Euros.  Also, Rick's listed hours for restaurants and museums are not always current; it's best to call using the included telephone numbers to confirm.  Rick's handy guide on reserving hotels, a tapas primer, and included glossary, along with a brief Spanish history, make this an invaluable guide for those who want to experience Spain to the fullest.  Rick steers you away from American-style hotels and restaurants and tourist traps so that you can ""live like a local,"" and it's far more authentic (and fun).  For those interested in visiting Gibraltar and Morocco, Rick includes a short, basic guide to Tangier and an extended tour of Morocco.  Well worth the cost, although at this date (August 2005), you'd be better off waiting for the Rick Steves' Spain 2006, due out this fall.",Positive
"Julie Alvarez's (""How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent"") newest novel ""Finding Miracles"" is the story of Milly Milagros Kaufman, a typical all-American, half-Jewish high schooler with a not-so-typical secret: Milly was adopted as an infant from a war-torn Latin American country, where her adopted parents were serving in the Peace Corps.  Milly has managed to successfully keep this info from her best friend Em, friends Jake and Dylan, and the community at large, because thinking about her sickly beginnings at an orphanage dredged up too many painful questions about why she was abandoned at the doorstep, who her birth parents may have been and if they ""disappeared"" during the dictatorship.<br /><br />Milly is forced to confront her past when Pablo Bol&iacute;var joins her grade at high school. Pablo and his parents are refugees from Milly's home country (which is never named).  One of his uncles was murdered, one of his brothers is a prisoner, and the other a revolutionary. Pablo asks Milly to help him with English in exchange for practicing Spanish, and one day makes a comment that changes Milly's life: he tells her that her eyes look like those of the mountain village Los Luceros.  Also, Milly overhears an angry family discussion in which her unhappy grandmother Happy effectively writes her out of her will as she is not a ""blood"" relation.<br /><br />Milly begins to slowly examine her feelings by confronting ""The Box,"" a mahogany box containing her adoption papers, naturalization papers, two locks of hair (one light, one dark), a coin, and several photos, and in a brave speech running for a class office, tells the story of her adoption to the school at large. The second half of the novel chronicles Milly's journey to her homeland. When Milly's home country is freed from tyranny and democracy is slowly put into place, she takes up Mrs. Bol&iacute;var's invitation to visit, searching for traces of her shadowy past. Milly and Paco become more than just friends, bonded by the shared sadness of having lost loved ones in the war.<br /><br />The novel does not have a ""fairy tale"" ending where everything works out perfectly, but the ending provided a satisfying conclusion to Milly's journey.  Realistically written and beautifully described, Alvarez captures a girl torn between cultures, languages, and her past, and how Milly, now Milagros, makes all the pieces fit.",Positive
"Like author Terry Gamble (of Proctor and Gamble lineage), I've spent nearly every summer of my life in and around Harbor Springs, Michigan, a small Northern Michigan resort community on the Little Traverse Bay. Gamble has drawn from her childhood memories spent on Harbor Point to create the lush settings for Water Dancers, using thinly veiled pseudonyms for Harbor Point (Beck's Point), Harbor Springs (Moss Village), Petoskey (Chibawasee), and Cross Village (Horseshoe Lake).<br />The novel's protagonist, Rachael Winnapee, is a sixteen-year old Odawa orphan from Horseshoe Lake who, since the death of her grandmother, has lived at the Indian School in Moss Village (the actual school is alongside the Holy Childhood of Jesus Catholic Church in Harbor Springs), and like many First Nations orphans, is sent to be a domestic at Beck's Point.<br />The novel begins in 1945. Rachael ends up serving the March family from St. Louis. The March's sons are both overseas fighting, Lip in Belgium and Woody in the Pacific Theater. When Lip is killed in battle and Woody comes home an amputee and morphine addict, it is up to Rachel to help make Woody whole. The two begin a brief, intense love affair, sealed with seashells, hidden gifts, lovemaking in dunes, shallows and empty rooms, and finally, Rachael's unwanted pregnancy.<br />Rachel raises her son Ben on her own, continuing to live with the midwives who delivered her child. After nine years of helping out on their farm, Rachel moves back to Horseshoe Lake with Ben. The novel fast forwards to Ben's experiences fighting in Vietnam and his difficult readjustment to civilian life, and culminates in an unexpected and explosive conclusion in which the past is confronted and old ghosts laid to rest.<br />Water Dancers is a multifaceted novel of healing (three of the main characters are veterans), of class and race, duty, discovering inner strength, and seeking peace. The characters are poetically and lovingly crafted, down to the most minor details. Terry Gamble's first novel deliciously brings to life the many moods of water and forest that dominate life in Northern Michigan, and for those who are familiar with Northern Michigan, like Rachael's habit of licking stones, this novel will bring you home.",Positive
"Kathleen Murphy lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1937. Ireland is in the midst of another Depression, and Kathleen's father is out of work. After showing up to her (Catholic) school late one too many times, one of the sisters recommends Irish dance lessons as a way to keep Kathleen out of trouble. Kathleen finds from the very first lesson that she loves to dance and has a real talent for it, but the issue of not being able to pay for classes nearly ends her career at the beginning.<br />She is chosen to represent her dance school at a feis (dance competition), but is haunted by her mother's severe illness and her lack of money for a dance costume (a requirement to participate). Her favourite Aunt Polly grows distant as well, and Kathleen prays for a miracle. Her miracle does indeed come, but not in a way anyone expected!<br />""Kathleen: The Celtic Knot"" is a fabulous read, very Irish in character (each novel is written by someone from the country it takes place in) and similar at times to Irish novelist Frank McCourt's voice. Many Irish expressions and Gaelic words are sprinkled liberally in the text. The back of the book features a segment on life in Ireland and a glossary of Irish/Gaelic words and expressions. An uplifting tale for American Girl fans and Irish dance enthusiasts, those who love Irish culture or those just looking for an entertaining read.",Positive
"Leyla is a twelve-year old living in Georgia in 1720. Her artist father went off to war and never came home, leaving Leyla and her brother Cengiz to find food and keep their mother and twin brothers afloat in a time of poverty. Leyla'a special skill is working with flowers, particularly tulips, which she cultivates. One day four foreign men come offering money for girls to be married, and Leyla chooses to go with them, leaving the coins for her family.<br />She soon discovers that the group of girls she is travelling with are not to be married, but to be sold as slaves. Leyla befriends five-year old Lena and acts as an older sister to her, but the two are split up in Istanbul, where they are sold to the highest bidder. Leyla ends up in the harem at Topkapi Palace as a gardening apprentice and quickly learns the rules and manners of the court, and through hard work and new friendships she realizes her dream of painting, growing tulips and being reunited with her family once more.<br />""Leyla"" is full of intriguing descriptions of the opulent palaces and gardens of Istanbul, life in the Georgian countryside, some of the basic tenets of Islam, gardening, and harem life. There are many Turkish/Arabic words scattered throughout, and a handy glossary at the back, along with a segment on girls' life in Turkey today. Out of the six ""Girls of Many Lands"" books that I've read (there are currently eight), ""Leyla"" is my new favourite.",Positive
"I am a huge fan of YA historical fiction, especially international historical fiction. Having lived in the lands that Isabel once ruled (Castilla y León), the novel was a pleasant reminder of the many castles, monasteries and medieval buildings I visited while living in northern Spain (Burgos). When I attended the Universidad de Burgos I took Spanish history as a requirement, and we learned about many of the events covered in this novel: the Moorish conquest in 711, the centuries of the Reconquista (the attempt to retake Spain and drive out the infidels), the final victory at Granada in January 1492, the later expulsion of Jews and Moors that year, and most fateful, Cristobál Colon's discovery of America, as well as the political intrigue surrounding Alfonso and Enrique, Juana La Beltraneja, and later Juana La Loca.<br />Isabel strives to follow the instruction of her confessor (later the head of the brutal Spanish Inquisition) Tomás de Torquemada, but is spirited, not content with the answers she is given. With her father dead and her mother having lost her senses, Isabel is left to fend for herself and to follow her heart.<br />Isabel's diary reads like exactly that: a diary, with long stretches of time glossed over, full of the tedious details that filled her confined life until her marriage. The extended cast of characters numbers near forty, and at times the book feels like a memory exercise. However, the author makes a brave attempt to bring to life a lost period of time when Spain was divided between Christian and Moor, and the Christian provinces were dangerous, full of outlaws and warring factions, each ruled by a separate king. Isabel's life is constantly at risk, caught in a war between her brothers, and it is her marriage to Fernando of Aragón that finally produces the beginnings of a unified España.<br />Although some information is inaccurate, ""Isabel: Jewel of Castilla"" is full of historical details about life in Spain, the political climate of the time, popular beliefs, court life and more, and various Spanish names/phrases are used (there is a handy glossary in the back). There is an abridged family tree, photocopies of maps, engravings and statues, and a list of characters provided at the end of the book.",Positive
"""Bare Bones"" is the sixth novel in the Tempe Brennan series, and as such builds upon previous characters, past events, and past plots, but hey...if the formula works, don't mess with it. Brennan, like author Kathy Reichs, is a forensic anthropologist who works between North Carolina and the province of Québec identifying causes of death and IDs remains too badly mangled or maimed for local experts (including the occasional animal).<br />  In ""Bare Bones"" we find Tempe back from her expedition in Guatemala (the setting of her last novel ""Grave Secrets"") about to go on a much-needed and long-anticipated beach vacation with detective Andrew Ryan, a colleague from Montréal. However, a series of ominous events derails her leisure time: a newborn's charred remains found in a crack house, a downed drug plane, a cache of bear (and human) bones on a farm, and missing federal agents draw Tempe into another sinister web of deception, danger and death. A mysterious stalker, the Grim Reaper, threatens all that Tempe loves by leaving chilling snapshots as seen through the scope of a high-powered rifle. What has Tempe stumbled onto?<br />This time around (and much to my consternation), Tempe spends no time in my beloved Québec. That was one of the draws that I loved so much in ""Déjà Dead:"" the vivid descriptions of ""La Belle Province,"" the descriptions of local Montréal hangouts and restaurants, the charming québécois touches, all set Kathy Reichs apart. In ""Bare Bones,"" however, Reichs grounds Tempe in the South. I loved the research about Melungeons (a subject of great interest to me).  Melungeons (meaning ""cursed"" or ""lost soul"") live in the Appalachians and are believed to be descendants of Portuguese sailors, Roanoke survivors, First Nations, and possibly Turkish slaves among others), but overall the book seemed to cover less new ground than past outings. Similarly, the three plots are much less loosely connected than in previous novels. The budding romance between Tempe and Ryan was very deftly and gently carried out, although Ryan is not actually present for most of the novel. Tempe's Green Party rants at the end of the book seemed incongruous, more a political statement than in character for Tempe, but overall ""Bare Bones"" is another enjoyable read from Reichs. I only hope the next novel is set in Québec once more.",Positive
"Let it be known: I am a train nut. A VIA Rail nut, to be more specific. So when I heard about this great little mystery about a murder aboard the Canadian from Winnipeg to Vancouver, I had to read it! ""Murder on the Canadian"" was a short read, but a very enjoyable one.<br />Protagonist Tom Austen wants to become a detective like his idols the Hardy Boys. Tom knows all the techniques: fingerprinting, poisons, collecting evidence and interrogating suspects, but when his vacation turns to a real murder investigation he gets more than he bargained for.<br />The beautiful Catherine Saks has been murdered in her room, apparently by her drunk, jealous husband. There are a number of suspects, and Tom has to move quickly and carefully to avoid being caught. The case takes a number of interesting twists and turns, including Tom nearly being abandoned in a small town, a poisoned omelette, and a fight in a railway tunnel with the killer.<br />Vivid descriptions, steady pacing and plenty of great conversations, as well as several action-packed sequences make this an enjoyable read for mystery and train fans of all ages.",Positive
"I used Cantarino's ""Civilización y cultura de España"" for some of my classes in Burgos, Spain, and found it to be an excellent supplement to the material that we were studying in class (from prehistory and Atapuerca to post-Franco democratic Spain). Each chapter covers a specific period in Spanish history, along with notes on art, architecture, music, literature for each time period. I found the level of Spanish to be very easy, although it might prove a bit challenging to second or third year Spanish students. The look of the book is a bit outdated (colour photos would have been nice for the art photos!), and the ""history"" ends at 1996 or so. Overall, a worthy investment, complete with maps, a timeline, a glossary, and plenty of useful, compact information about the most important events and people in Spain throughout the ages.",Positive
"""Dancer"" is one of the most engaging novels that I have ever had the pleasure to read. Kaleidoscopic in nature, various events of Rudolph Nureyev's life are told by family members, teachers, dance partners, and friends, and this constantly changing perspective helps keep the novel's momentum.<br />""Dancer"" begins in grim postwar Russia with the arrival of wounded soldiers, and young Rudolph wonders if his father will be arriving with them. He dances for the soldiers in the makeshift hospital, and eventually studies dance with an exiled former ballerina. Later he goes to Leningrad to continue his training, living with Yulia, a repressed translator trapped in an abusive, dead-end marriage. Rudolph is blossoming into adulthood, arrogant and mysterious, and it becomes clear to all that he will become a legend of ballet. To the shock of family and friends, he defects from the Soviet Union even as his fame grows, but secret agents continue to hound him, waiting for him to trip up so he can be sent to the hard labour camps or even sentenced to death. The rest of the novel chronicles his stormy love affair with Erik Bruhn, his journeys between London and Paris, his later friendship with gay hustler Victor Pareci and the downward spiral of drugs, unsafe sex, dance injuries, a risky return to the Soviet Union, and hints of his losing battle against AIDS.<br />The numerous narrators include Odile, Nureyev's French maid, Margot Fonteyn, Victor Pareci, a London shoemaker, Rudolph's sister Tamara, Yulia, and others. Somehow McCann manages to keep the individual threads of the story separate, yet interwoven enough to form a shimmering tapestry of passion, betrayal, dedication, and above all the dance itself, spanning four decades of Nureyev's life and his final return to visit his ailing mother and friends. Touching and vibrant, ""Dancer"" is a whirlwind ride into the mind and body of an exiled ballet genius who will never be forgotten.",Positive
"I first heard about ""How To Be A Canadian"" on CBC's ""Basic Black,"" in which Arthur Black interviewed the Ferguson brothers (Will and Ian) and they read some of the best parts of the book out loud. What can I say...I was hooked and rushed out to buy a copy at Chapters (Amazon.ca didn't exist then...sorry guys, I'm now a loyal Amazon.ca customer!). ""HTBAC"" reads fairly quickly, but it is an immensely enjoyable read, and explosively funny in spots (don't read this at work if you don't want coworkers giving you looks of sympathy after your random hyena laughter).<br />""How To Be A Canadian"" conveniently packages our national heroes, cuisine, regional differences, literary endeavours, phobias, and odd social customs into a laugh-out-loud tome that is the literary equivalent of Timbits: tasty, bite-sized chapters on ""Who To Hate and Why,"" ""How To Waste Time Like A Canadian,"" ""Mating Rituals,"" ""Art and Stuff,"" ""Progressive Conservatives, Responsible Government and Other Oxymorons,"" and ""Twelve Ways To Say You're Sorry,"" along with how to insult Canadians, the official Canadian haircut and dress code (mullet, plaid shirt, skidoo boots with fake buckles), provincial ""fact sheets"" (Ontario: ""Gaze Upon our Humble Magnificence and Bow Down Before Us!"" Formal name: The Centre of the Universe. Provincial motto: ""Celebrating over 100 years of narcissistic self-absorption"") and more. To top it off the Ferguson brothers have written a clever little quiz at the end to test your Canadian knowledge (If you hear the name ""Elvis"" and immediately think of figure skating, give yourself one point. If you still don't know what the capital of New Brunswick is, give yourself 10 points. If you can't remember if you curled or not, because of how drunk you were: 50 points) You get the idea. Nothing is sacred for Will and Ian, which is what makes the book so funny.<br />So, if you're American and want to learn more about those mysterious neighbo(u)rs of yours to the north, this is the book for you. If you're a Canadian who needs a quick reply to ""What makes a Canadian"" (other than *not* being an American), this book is for you. I have bought ""How to Be A Canadian"" for a number of friends with different tastes and it's been a success all around. A funny, thoughtful book that hits the mark on all the issues and is certainly entertaining in the process (that's PROcess, not prahcess, eh?) Have fun, and good luck to any Future Canadians out there!",Positive
"&quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; was penned by American author Washington Irving (&quot;Rip Van Winkle,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) during a stay at the legendary Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I bought this book after my visit to the Alhambra, and found it to be a fantastic companion to what I had seen and experienced.<br />The Alhambra (and Generalife) is a combination fort/palace/gardens dating from the 13th century, filled with fantastic Arabic architecture (ornate plasterwork, ceramic tiles, sculpted marble fountains and archways), and lots of room for imagining the days of its former greatness, which Irving brings to life most memorably. The book is illustrated with charming and detailed watercolour engravings dating from the same period when the book was written.<br />Irving seamlessly winds legend, history, and a Spanish travelogue of sorts together, and even though the book is over 170 years old, it seems as if it was written yesterday. There are tales of princes, genies, lost and found loves, enchanted treasures, battles, hellish headless horses (does the inspiration seem familiar?), and commentary on the Spanish landscape and nature of the Spaniards that he lives with. Full of bewitching music, the smell of roses and exotic perfumes, firey sunsets, and the ghosts of the past, the book is a sensory treat as well. If you plan on visiting the Alhambra, read this first--it will definitely enhance your experience. If you've already visited, this makes a priceless souvenir, bringing to life once more the stately halls and fragrant gardens.",Positive
"A family member gave me the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Spain as a bon voyage gift, and it has proved an essential guide on what to see, do, and eat in Spain. As someone who will be spending a bit of time in northern Spain (four months), the Eyewitness Guide has proved invaluable on excursions to nearby cities (including Madrid). Since Spain is full of thousands of monuments, churches and cathedrals, bullrings (for those who, like me, oppose the inherent cruelty of bullfights and animal abuse in Spain, one can always appreciate the architecture of famous bullrings), museums, palaces, monasteries and other places of interest, the Eyewitness Guide gives you the best of the best, with brief synopses, maps and must-sees in museums, street maps, photos, historical backgrounds and more.<br />I especially appreciated the features for each region, such as wildlife, wines, and regional food specialties. I plan to visit many different cities and regions while I am in Spain, and now I have ideas on what I want to spend my time on. There is also a handy survival guide including phoning in Spain, police, shopping suggestions, size charts for clothing and shoes and monetary conversions between Euros and pesetas.<br />I found this book most useful in conjunction with the ""Let's Go: Spain, Portugal and Morocco"" guide that was given to me by a friend before I left. My only grudge with the Eyewitness guide is its lack of lodging information--there are few hotels (and no hostels) listed, even though there are upwards of twenty in my town (Burgos). The ""Let's Go"" guide is more useful for (cheap) lodging information, and the hostel I stayed at in Madrid (Hostal Aguilar, Calle San Jeronimo 32, second floor) was an unbeatable bargain, as well as spotlessly clean with a private bath and centrally located. If I had used the Eyewitness guide I would have easily spent much more. Also, there are no maps for smaller cities, something which the ""Let's Go"" guide provides. But finding maps in Spanish towns is generally not difficult as there are tourism offices in nearly every town that provide maps free of charge.<br />Overall, the Eyewitness guide is well worth the price, and the colourful photos, excellent research and interesting side notes make exploring Spain a pleasure. Extremely useful for the traveller or for those who are working and living in Spain.",Positive
"""Girl in Hyacinth Blue,"" like ""Girl With A Pearl Earring,"" explores the legacy of Dutch master painter Jan Vermeer. It is a fictitious account revolving around the discovery of a previously unknown Vermeer painting as viewed from several historical eras as the painting falls into the hands of new owners (done in reverse chronological order). The novel begins in the present, with a German math teacher confiding to a colleague about his father's stolen Vermeer, dubbed ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue."" The rest of the novel is a series of short stories that trace the lineage of the painting: the Jewish family in Antwerp that Otto Engelbrecht (the father of Cornelius, the math teacher) had stolen the painting from, an adulterous Frenchwoman in exile, a husband remembering his first love, a Dutch family in 1717 that rescued an infant in a flood, the father of the infant, and finally Vermeer's inspiration for the painting.<br />Full of lush details that bring the various historical eras into sharp focus, Vreeland's descriptions paint the fictitious ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"" not only as a remarkable painting (""certain brush strokes subtly changed their tint,"" ""the russet of the girl's skirt glistened like maple leaves in autumn sun,"" ""creamy yellow light the colour of the inner petals of jonquils illuminated the girl's face and reflected points of light on her shiny fingernails,"" ""the blue in the girl's smock, which hung in graceful folds of that luscious deep blue of the early hyacinths when the blooms are just beginning to open""), but as a captivating presence in the lives of its owners. Sweeping across several generations and owners from all walks of life, ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"" is a fascinating read about the impact of true art on daily life, and the legacy of a truly gifted painter.",Positive
"I own both of Sarah McLachlan's piano songbooks (&quot;Sarah McLachlan Collection&quot; and &quot;Surfacing&quot;) and this is my favourite of the two. I've been playing piano for fourteen years and I've been a fan of Sarah for just as long. &quot;Surfacing&quot; features piano transcriptions that sound almost exactly like the CD. &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; captures the shimmering guitar intro and saucy feel, &quot;I Love You&quot; is a haunting piano solo that trails off into silence, &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; was my least favourite....that haunting guitar intro just didn't cross over to piano as well. &quot;Adia&quot; sounds just like the recording, as does &quot;Angel,&quot; and &quot;Last Dance&quot; performs beautifully (a musical saw played the melody on &quot;Surfacing&quot;). &quot;Full of Grace&quot; was featured on the &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; soundtrack a number of years back and is very delicate; &quot;Witness&quot; becomes a powerful song on piano with its striking, rhythmic bass chords that underscore the melody. &quot;Black and White&quot; was another song that I routinely skip over--somehow the piano just doesn't do it justice. This is the best transcription of popular music that I've ever had the pleasure to play--it is at times haunting, assertive, lovesick and playful. If you are a Sarah McLachlan fan you'll also want to check out the &quot;Sarah McLachlan Songbook&quot; that features songs from &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Solace&quot; along with &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot;",Positive
"I picked up ""Basket Case"" after reading about it on Amazon.com and I wasn't disappointed! I finished it over the weekend and look forward to reading more of Carl Hiaasen's works.<br />""Basket Case"" combines the gritty world of rock and roll and the recording industry with a pinch of romance, whodunit and death...lots o' death. Our leading man Jack Tagger writes obituaries and is obsessed with death, going as far as memorizing what celebrities died at what age, then seeing if he will outlive them.<br />At times ""Basket Case"" requires suspension of reality, but there are many enjoyable moments (the dead lizard in the freezer being one of them) as Jack searches for the truth about the death of Jimmy Stoma, lead singer of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies. Hiaasen obviously has a handle on modern pop culture as he drops current band names and trends every few pages and doesn't miss a beat. Carl introduces us to the newsroom, ravers, Ecstasy, photo shop girls who make secret duplicates of naughty amateur photos, industry scumbags with L'Oreal hair and thug bodyguards, a Courtney Lovesque widow bent on building her career at the expense of her deceased husband.<br />The plot moves along at a steady pace, and Hiaasen includes enough twists and turns to make things interesting every few chapters. Being a musician, I enjoyed the musical descriptions and aspects of the book. Lots of memorable characters and moments.",Positive
"Will Ferguson, author of &quot;Canadian History for Dummies,&quot; &quot;Bastards and Boneheads,&quot; &quot;Why I Hate Canadians,&quot; and &quot;How To Be A Canadian (Even If You Already Are One),&quot; has truly hit the mark with &quot;Hokkaido Highway Blues.&quot; As someone who has studied Japanese culture and language for the last five years and will be teaching in Japan through the JET Programme in the next few years, this book was a much-needed laugh and a cultural revelation about Japan.<br />Japan is a surprising country in many ways: its customs, obsession with Western culture, slang and fads, the blend of city and country, ancient and modern. Ferguson takes the reader on a memorable journey from the southernmost point on the island of Kyushu (Cape Sata) to Cape Sooya on the northernmost island of Hokkaido, home to the Canadian World amusement park. I kid you not. This is another example of perplexing Japanese behaviour. Canadian World is a theme park that recreates Avonlea on PEI and has Canadian guides greet visitors and teach them Canadian crafts. I'll be sure to visit when I'm homesick for Canada. Right.<br />Ferguson is hilarious at times when telling Japanese about Canada: &quot;In Ka-Na-Da everyone lives in peace and harmony. It sure is great being a Canadian. You get to share all the material benefits of living next door to the United States, yet at the same time you get to act smug and haughty and morally superior. You just can't beat that kind of irresponsibility.&quot;<br />&quot;Hokkaido Highway Blues&quot; is as much a reflection of being Canadian as it is about Japan.<br />Ferguson nails cultural attitudes, the art of Japanese conversation, spreads out dishes of miso, unagi, tako, tonkatsu, and other delicacies for us to sample, shows us the many shades of green, rocky shores, and Shinto shrines, and makes us love his vision of Japan. His humour, honesty, and excellent storytelling abilities make this a true treasure for anyone interested in Japan (JET teachers should be required to read this before they go!), the exhilaration of hitchhiking into the unknown, and making do in a foreign environment.",Positive
"One of my literati friends gave this to me for my birthday last year as a joke since I always talk about writing more but I always manage to procrastinate. Joel Saltzman's &quot;If You Can Talk You Can Write&quot; was both funny and insightful and helped me kick some of my bad writing habits (being too much of a perfectionist during early drafts, beating writer's block, revising). After I read it I sat down the next day and followed Joel's advice: write about whatever, as long as I was writing again. This is like writer therapy (or rehabiliation). It got me off my chesterfield and back at the keyboard.<br />This is a great tool for student writers and university writing courses. If I ever decide to teach creative writing, this book will definitely be on my required reading list. Too many writers burn out from many of the topics Joel discusses, such as being too critical, too much of a perfectionist, or labouring away trying to imitate the style of the classic writers instead of finiding your own unique voice.",Positive
"As a kid I loved sitting around reading these, sometimes by myself tucked away in a dark, musty corner, or better yet, on Halloween with friends. OK, so the stories weren't really all that scary, but they are a lot of fun. The illustrations are morbid and occasionally gruesome, and really lend to the atmosphere of &quot;terror.&quot; There are tons of other, scarier books on the market, sure, but these are a lot of fun for parents and kids alike. No murdered cheerleaders &agrave; la R.L. Stine. Some of my favourite moments include the voice moaning out &quot;Bloody fingers....&quot; and the hippie is just, like, &quot;Get a band-aid, man!&quot; and the Viper (&quot;I'm here to vash and vipe the vindows&quot;).<br />These stories were collected from folklore and retold by Alvin Swartz. And you'll find all types of timeless, classic tales in here. Ghost stories, graverobber stories, tales of people raised by wild animals, zombie stories, humourous stories, even modern tales based on urban legends. Each book is prefaced with some history, and their are annoted sources and extensive bibliographies.<br />There are loads of creepy, morbid, and yes, scary illustrations throughout the book in ink and grey watercolour...very gravelike. Some of them still creep me out today years later. Some of them might give you nightmares and resurface in front of you when you're all alone in the dark.<br />To make a scary atmosphere try reading these on a dark, rainy, preferably stormy night by flashlight. Put on Danny Elfman's creepy, creepy soundtrack to &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; Listen for unexplained crashes, creaks, and moans in between crashes of thunder...read some more...you will end up scared in the end.",Positive
"I saw a review of &quot;Sacré Blues&quot; in a Canadian newspaper (I don't remember which one) and decided that, since I was in Québec and frankly quite clueless regarding many aspects of Québec history and culture, I picked up a copy at an Archambault in Sainte-Foy. I had resolved to put it away for the return train trip to Toronto, but I started reading a little bit each night. At some points in the book I was laughing out loud so much my neighbours must have wondered about my sanity.<br />I spent a month in Québec and plan to return often, and &quot;Sacré Blues&quot; helped me to understand some of the issues in modern Québec. I have taken a Québécois civilisation course, but there are many topics in the book that elaborated on things we had touched on in class, such as Québécois winters, language, popular culture, famous people, the strange and fascinating addiction to cholesterol-laden food (poutine! May Wests! Pepsi!), tabloid newspapers, politics, the Floribécois (retired Québécois who migrate in droves to Florida every winter), Céline Dion, and much, much more.<br />Grescoe writes with tongue-in-cheek humour that sometimes amounts to laugh-out-loud guffawing, such as the Québec Language Police...something that I evidence firsthand. Some of the topics seemed to go on for much too long, but generally the book is funny and informative, sort of a mini-introduction to Québec. Very well written, with a glossary of terms and famous Québécois, important dates, and cultural notes.",Positive
"This book is an amazing collection of knowledge, use, and cultural history of the Native American flute. Its discussion of flute construction, fingering, scales, ornaments, and care and maintenance is excellent. The book expects the reader to have a basic grasp of musical notation and concepts.<br />An added bonus: eighteen of R. Carlos Nakai's tunes transcribed for flute. These are: December Snow, 12/13/82 song, Wioste Olowan Inkpa taya, Wioste Olowan Tokiya, 11/3/82 song, Death song, 11/11/82 song, Zuni song, 12/20/82 song, 12/13/82 no. 2 song, 11/20/82 song, Whippoorwill, Whirlwinds Dancing, Coventry Carol, Rainy Nights in Taos, Omaha song, The Colours Fall, and Crow Wing.<br />There is also an excellent chapter at the end of the book regarding R. Carlos Nakai's recordings and his influences. Ken Light, the maker of Amon Olorin flutes (R. Carlos Nakai plays an Amon Olorin Sonoran) also contributes. This is an indispensable guide to the Native American flute and is worth the cost.",Positive
"The book is just a listing of brand specific drinks which makes looking for drinks to make a pain in the butt if you are making them at home or don't work at a really, and I mean really, fancy bar.

They also don't have any of the fun drinks people are ordering now a days, sour patch kids, payday bar, birthday cake. This is a book for the rich and the &#34;traditional&#34; in pallet.

She came from a very meager background and I am certain she used that as inspiration for this complex stories where most of the characters are flawed but complex. The story is not a far stretch from what it is like to loive in slums that are just a stones throw from the Upper Class and how the poor are marginalized and vilified.

"I look forward to reading this book, however the print is incredibly small, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to read it at all.  I'm very disappointed, because I was hoping to learn more about the Titanic.",Positive
Excellent book - very pleasant reading!,Positive
Love all of Ms Gunn's books!,Positive
Loved this book!  Well written and very interesting!,Positive
Bought as a gift for my grandson; I know he'll love it!,Positive
Grew up reading Pippi books - can't wait to start reading them again in my &#34;second childhood&#34;!,Positive
Love anything Downton Abbey!,Positive
"Haven't read it yet, but I'm looking forward to it - he's a great man!",Positive
Good book - always enjoy Lisa Wingate's writing!,Positive

Very informative and interesting book,Positive
I've thoroughly enjoyed the whole Father Christmas series - terrific author and very engaging plots!,Positive
"Perfect calendar for the space I've got, and I look forward to each new month!",Positive
I've always loved Wysocki's art - and even more since I met him some years ago!,Positive
I always enjoy anything related to Peanuts!!!,Positive
"Wow!  What a remarkable young woman, and what an amazing ministry she has!  I plan to begin supporting her financially as soon as possible.  She's a blessing to the young girls she works with as she does what the Lord called her to do.",Positive
"I ordered this book because my daughter-in-love was expecting a D.S. baby, so I wanted a bit of mental and emotional preparation.  The book was very helpful with that and I'm so glad I read it.",Positive
This set of books will hopefully delight my grandson as much as it delights me!!,Positive
"Just finished reading this book last night, long after I should have been asleep - it was a fascinating story of the Oaks first 30 years.  Now it's time for another one about the last 10 years!  They're a fantastic and devoted group of men, not to mention that they can sing their hearts out in an incredible performance, even in a not-too-big town like Prescott AZ, where I had a front-row seat for their most recent concert here earlier this year!!!",Positive
"This book is a must for those of us who spent our formative years in Southern California!  I was born in 1945, and spent the first 20 - 30 years of my life in and around the San Gabriel Valley, so I recognize and remember so clearly huge portions of this book.  In fact, my father was a Helmsman for a few years when I was pre-school age and I can remember when he took me along on his route now and then, and how excited I was when he let me blow that famous whistle!  I've only read the first 35 pages or so (I want to savor it, slowly!) and dozens of the pictures have brought back treasured memories; some from my childhood and many from my adult years.  The Rose Parade, Pacific Ocean Park, Lake Arrowhead Village, Chinatown, Clifton's Cafeteria, Knott's Berry Farm, and of course, Disneyland!  My family went to Disneyland the first week it opened in 1955, and I've been back a number of times, although it's changed more than I like.  Progress, I suppose, but that's another story.  I'd love to share this book with friends, but I'd be afraid it would never come back, so I'll just tell them where they can buy their own copy.  I can absolutely guarantee they'll love it as much as I do!!",Positive
"This book was suggested to me by some friends who knew the author and her late husband.  It's a very good, although small, book.  There are many helpful quotes from other widows.  As it happens, my late husband and I attended the same church where her husband pastored, although we weren't there at that time.  I attend there now by myself, and know many of the women she quotes.  That's been an additional blessing to me, because I can see for myself that there IS life after the passing of one's beloved husband.  I will purchase additional copies for others, as needed.",Positive
"I gave up on this after about 50 pages in which the author said nothing much, and she said it over and over again.  I don't like to be critical, but I also don't like to waste money, and that's what I did.  It's going to the thrift store in a few days.  Sorry...",Negative
"I've been a fan of Ellen Stouffer's calendars for many years, and was upset when I couldn't find it on the website where I'd purchased it in the past.  So I checked Amazon, and lo and behold - there it was.  I love her work, especially the Scripture verses for each month, and the amazing detail in her pictures.  There's always something to look at, on each page.  Thank you, Ellen Stouffer - you bless me with each new picture!",Positive
Great read:,Positive
"The book is well made and the photos are very nice.  It is a great guide from start to finish.  Lists tools and supplies needed.  I recommend this book.  The pages are thick, too.",Positive
The book has great presentation and color. The recipes look great and appetizing.  Great book to have for fresh recipes while on Keto.,Positive
This book is well made and laid out well.  The recipes are clear and easy to follow.  The illustrations are nice and colorful.,Positive
"I don't understand why they have his friends randomly pop up at his house, watching him brush his teether and being in places they wouldn't normally be.<br /><br />The book is well made.",Positive
"This book is fun, attractive to a child and keeps their attention. Lots of different lessons in the book. Great for summer practice or anytime.",Positive
"This calendar is great.  My daughter loves it!  It's a little on the thin side, but I'm finding most calendars are. I guess it's their way of cutting back.  Looks great and it's a fun calendar!",Positive
"This book is great to learn some basic spanish words.  Some of the words are a bit difficult to write for preschool-1, but is a great tool for teaching the basics of the language.  I recommend this book as a start to learning Spanish.",Positive
"This book offers a wide variety of tropical drinks.  Great for by the pool, on vacation or anytime!  It's a nice hardcover book.  If you love tropical drinks, you won't be disappointed.",Positive
"This isn't very exciting, but it does occupy the little one for a few minutes.  He likes that he can erase it.  I think that's a lot of the fun for him. It's helpful in learning numbers.  Easy to clean.",Positive
"This is a nice devotional, not what I was looking for though. I wanted more of a devotional vs a recipe book.<br /><br />It just didn't seem to have either of what I was looking for.  It does have some nice recipes.",Positive
"These card readers are really nice.  They are laminated and you get 6 of each laminated card with 6 readers. The card folds in half to make it book-like.<br /><br />The readers are on Chimpanzees, Ants, the Inuit people, sounds, the African elephant and weird jobs.<br /><br />This would be a great addition for a teacher who happens to be teaching on Chimpanzees and the other items, afore mentioned.<br /><br />It would be nice to include a quiz at the end of each book.",Positive
"I highly recommend &#34;The Complete Sailor: Learning the Art of Sailing&#34; by David Seidman instead of this one or any other sailing book, for that matter.  This is still a good book, just not the best.",Positive
I gave this book to my daughter who is 16. She has loved makeup since she was 12.  She loves creating new eye designs and this book as inspired her to be more creative.,Positive
"Well made book.  Nice cover and photos.  Instructions are detailed.  If you are looking for a few creative ideas for a small, intimate gathering this is the book for you.  I would get the paper back.  I don't see the value in getting it in a hardback, unless you just prefer to pay more because you like hardback books.<br /><br />This book is more for a sit down dinner type of party, whether it's inside or outside.  It has some fun ideas for the crafter who is having a small gathering of maybe 6-8 people.<br /><br />No ideas in it for a large gathering.",Positive
"I'm still looking at the book.  I'll be updating my feedback of this book as I get further into it.  It is in textbook format, more of a school book than an self teaching book, but again, i will update further once I have been able to research some of the links included.",Positive
It's great! A devotion a day.  Just long enough to be informative but short enough to hold their attention. Really wonderful for a pre-teen or a tween.,Positive
I’m not even q newly wed but was looking for a fun cookbook to make some new dishes for my boyfriend and I and I’m so excited to make so many of these dishes. I feel like this book has such a great selection of recipes for a really well rounded meal plan.,Positive
I bought this item as a gift.It is a great CD.,Positive
My son loves it,Positive
Looking forward to next book,Positive
"Took me 2 months of studying and taking all 4 exams, but I passed!!! Wooo hooo 🥳🥳 this book is the key to success along with some YouTube videos. But truly, this book is tied to Ged.com where you take your exams, so it’s all relative information",Positive
"I chose this book for the same reason they went to France , and lived in the French manner.  It's a lifestyle  that permits true enjoyment without the pressures of the nose to the grindstone. Living, feeling, tasting, hearing, savoring,  life not drudgery",Positive
Good reading!,Positive
Great!,Positive
"This tray is great, looks exactly like the picture, it arrived fast and well packaged and I love it! It's the perfect size, not too small not too big just enough to hold your small jewelry, necklaces, earrings, etc... Plus it looks amazingly cute and fits almost anywhere, I really like this I will buy another one as a gift because it's very pretty as well :D",Positive
"I just gave this to my 21 year old daughter. She's graduating in the spring with a degree in Wildlife Biology. Her favorite area of study is birds. She literally squealed when I gave this to her. She was about to start an activity, but when she saw this, she immediately found a desk and started filling in some of her recent bird encounters & observations.  She likes the format and layout of this bird journal. She was impressed with the bird lists. She says she's going to keep this with her in her bag so she can add to it as she sees them. This would make a great present for any bird lover!",Positive
"This National Geographic book titled Octopus, Seahorse, Jellyfish is a beautiful book. It is broken into the 3 sections, one for each of the animals. There are a few pages of information and diagrams, then the rest of the sections are filled with photos. Some of the  photos are labeled with the specific name/type of the animal as well as the details about size and location. It would make a lovely coffee table book.",Positive
"In many ways, this word search book is nicer than I expected. The pages are a thick paper. The pages are double sided. I use highlighters when working in word searches. The pages are thick enough that I haven't noticed any bleed through. I've only used yellow highlight so far, but I am pleased. The book is divided into 3 sections - easy, moderate, and difficult. I would say that those divisions are accurate. I wasn't sure they would be. I actually made a mistake in the difficult section. I was looking for ""Argentina"". I thought I found it so I highlighted it. Turns out I highlighted ""Argentin"". There were a couple of other words that had the same trickery. I learned to be more careful! Overall, it's a good quality word search filled with 300 puzzles. That should keep me busy for quite a while!",Positive
"I am a longtime fan of DK books. They are always informative and visually appealing. This book is technically a children's book, but it can easily be enjoyed by all ages. The book is filled with photos and pictures of items in nature. The text is easy to read and understand. It's informative and interesting. My kids are grown now, but this has a place on my book shelf anyway. It's a beautiful book!",Positive
"With 2 columns, there's room for lots of items. I almost always have to go to the back side of my shopping lists to finish listing things. I do have to write a bit smaller on this pad, but it's nice not having to use the back side and flip back and forth while shopping. The pad has a magnet on the back which works fine. The border design is fun and cheery. You get 2 pads, so I should be set for a while!",Positive
"This piece of historical fiction is very engaging! It takes a difficult subject matter and presents it in an interesting, yet honest story. The story goes back and forth between two different times, but it wasn't too difficult to follow. I was initially turned off because of it being a YA book, but I'm so glad I kept at it! It's well written and I didn't want to stop reading! I'm recommending it to my 20 year old daughter to read!",Positive
I absolutely love these postcards! They have a retro style vibe to them. The pictures are beautiful. My daughter is a studying animal biology and plans to use some of these to decorate her apartment next year. The quality is excellent. They are thick and sturdy as far as postcards go. These are comparable to what you would find at a museum or national park gift shop.,Positive
"I found The Ladies of the Secret Circus to be a captivating story. It's a dark circus themed fantasy that switches from 1925 to 2004. The story was fast paced and exciting. While the story wasn't a slow starter, I was pretty busy when I started it and it took me several days before I could fully devote the time to reading it. Then when I did, I pretty much inhaled it over 2 days. The characters were likeable and well written. I loved reading the descriptions of 1925 Paris. I am definitely going to check out Constance Sayers' A Witch in Time.",Positive
"This YA book, It Only Happens in the Movies is fast paced and entertaining. The story does have some adult language and mild sexual content. The recommended age is 14 + . As a former teacher and a mother of a daughter, I would agree with that recommendation. The story uses a little bit of text messaging throughout the book which makes it a more modern story versus the books that I grew up reading. I did feel that the characters acted/responded a little older than they were, but that's just my opinion. Overall, it's a fun light read.",Positive
"Cold Wind is the 2nd in Paige Shelton's Alaska Wild series. It was exciting and fast paced. The main character, Beth is hiding in Alaska from a guy who kidnapped her. Since it had been over a year since I read the 1st title, Thin Ice, I felt a bit lost in the beginning. After a few chapters, I was beginning to remember some of the characters and events from it. There is a stand-alone mystery in this book which is solved, but the greater mystery of her kidnapping is not resolved. So I guess I have to wait another year to find out the rest!",Positive
"I am a DK book lover. I've started getting the DK Smithsonian collaborations. In my opinion, they're the grownup version of the traditional DK books. This is what I would classify as a coffee table book. I have a stack of similar books on my bookshelf in the living room. They're great for picking up and perusing. There's usually no obligation to read it straight through. I like to skim and pick the pages that interest me at that moment. The pictures in this book are gorgeous. Clear, crisp photos, maps, art work, and more. Items are labeled and described thoroughly. This is really an amazing book!",Positive
"This is a beautiful book.  It has a nice story and lovely illustrations. The story introduces the reader to Saint-Saens' Carnival of the Animals. There are spots to press that play music. Some of the buttons were a little difficult to properly press, but after a few tries, we learned the trick to it. This would make a great gift!",Positive
"The kitty book is absolutely precious!! I ordered it thinking I would give it to my 7 year old niece, but upon seeing it in person, I think it might be too easy for her. I will let her read it with me, but I'm keeping it for the future grand kids! I'm a crazy cat lady and this book just goes along with my persona. The book is filled with clever rhymes and beautiful kitty photos.",Positive
My daughter has always been fascinated with animals and nature. She's currently attending college and majoring in fisheries and wildlife. She absolutely loves this book. It's beautiful! The illustrations are gorgeous. The book talks about the history of classifying animals and is very interesting. This is definitely a keeper!,Positive
"This is a fast paced thriller. Izzy survives an encounter with a serial killer but is left with no memories of the incident. Now, 20 years later, she and her husband move into a lovely countryside home which gives her some bad feelings. Of course, I'm wondering why you would move somewhere if it didn't feel right to you! But this is fiction, and stranger things have happened in the world. The book starts out with alternating chapters between Izzy in the present day and her attacker in the past. There are a few characters introduced that have the reader guessing as to which one is the serial killer. There are some predictable moments. I ended up reading this over a few days and by the end, I couldn't put it down.",Positive
"What a fun coloring book! This is perfect for adult/teen fans of kitties! It's a good quality coloring book. The pages are fairly thick. I like to use fine tip markers and I have not noticed any bleed through, but it's probably a good idea to test it out first. The pages have lots of fun details to color.",Positive
"My daughter is the target audience - she's a vegetarian college student. This is a well planned book with lots of affordable vegetarian meal options. There are some vegan recipes, too, but I would say that most of them are not vegan. Most of the ingredients are pretty standard and are things we have at home. There are some that will require a trip to the store. The layout of the book is quite nice. It is broken down into categories. Nutritional information is provided. The only photos in the book are at the beginning of each chapter. My daughter has already tried a couple of recipes and so far, she's been pleased with them.",Positive
I love a book full of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end. This book definitely delivers that! It was a fast paced book that I had difficulties putting down. There were plenty of twists that were making me second guess everything! It purposely written to make you wonder about a character's mental health and sanity. I was pleased and satisfied with how the book ended. I'm definitely going to be checking into other books by this author!,Positive
"This is what I would classify as a mystery/thriller book. The chapters alternate between the point of view of the widow and the wife. After about 2/3rds of the book, you discover something that makes you question everything that you had already read. That discovery really messed with me!! The story was unpredictable and fast paced. Even after finishing it, I can't help but think of various events and details that took place and how they were twisted. It was my first book by the author and I would definitely consider reading others by him.",Positive
"Siri, Who Am I is a fun book with a refreshing take on amnesia. Mia wakes up in the hospital, not remembering anything about who she is and how she got there. She uses her phone and social media to learn what she can about her identity. It's fast paced and very entertaining. In this digital age, I found it timely. My only complaint is the use of footnotes. While, I don't have a problem with footnotes in general, I found these interfered with the reading. I would not always notice the superscript numbers. Then when I got to the end of the page, I would see the footnote(s). Then I would have to go back and try to find the superscript so I knew what it was referencing. This actually happened a lot!  Parentheses would have been less frustrating. I read this very quickly, in about a day.",Positive
"I have seen several of Barry Sonnenfeld's movies over the years and have enjoyed them. After reading the promo for this autobiography, I was intrigued and interested in reading it. It's a pretty easy read and very entertaining. I found some of it to be a bit choppy at times, but that may have been due to it being an advanced copy. Sonnenfeld is at least ten years older than me, but I found a lot of his upbringing to be something I could relate with. There were some disturbing parts, but overall it was a good read.",Positive
"This book is a little heavier and more serious than what I usually read, but it was also quite intriguing. The story starts out with a teen girl who has spent her entire life living in an asylum. Her mother was committed while she was pregnant with the girl and ended up giving birth while in there. I felt a whole range of emotions - sadness, relief, pity and disbelief, and even more. The characters were well written and I liked most of them. It was a difficult read (probably more because of the disheartening story line than anything else), but it kept a steady pace. Overall, it was well worth the time.",Positive
"This guide book is just about New York City. It breaks the city down into known sections, such as Lower Manhattan or Soho. It's filled with tons of color pictures. There are itineraries for 24 hour visits, 2 day trips or 5 days. There's sections on traveling on a budget, traveling with families, and many other scenarios. There's lots of information and so much to do. While it does give a lot of information, it doesn't fully explain items with specific details. For example, it tells you that you can apply for free tickets to see the Late Show and other late shows. It gives the address of the locations, but it doesn't tell you how to apply for the tickets. It recommends lots of restaurants and eateries but there are still so many that cannot be included due to lack of space. It gives you lots of details about many sights, including hours. There are a bunch of maps throughout the book and a laminated pull out one in the back. It's a good size to toss in your purse or backpack.",Positive
"I was hooked from the beginning! It's an engaging book that never slowed down. It's told primarily in two perspectives - one is Nina, a grifter and Vanessa, a socialite/Instagram Influencer. There will be a chapter told from one of them and often the next one is retelling the same events but from the other's point of view. It's not quite what I would call a thriller, but it does have some thrilling elements. There are several twists that kept things exciting. I was unfamiliar with the author prior to reading it, but now I want to check out her other works!",Positive
"Okay...we'll I may have been crying a little. This is a beautiful story about a young woman with cancer. It engaged me from the very beginning and I kept reading it whenever I had the time over the next couple of days. It was pretty easy to read considering the serious subject. Many of the chapters were really short which allowed me to pick up and read when the time allowed without worrying about being able to finish a chapter before putting it down. While it is a sad story, it was beautiful, too.",Positive
"My family and I have been following a Keto diet for the past six months. We were doing pretty well until the holidays and then we've had difficulties getting back on track. This book may be just what we need to get our motivation back. We like the idea of having some flexibility with the high carb days. It has a nice layout, but I do wish there was a little more information specifically about the diet, but it has a good starting point for us. There are some recipes and food plans, too.",Positive
"This guidebook is the one to take on your trip to France. It's the average guide book size (not pocket sized) and has so much information in it. It covers seventeen different regions/areas of the country. It includes history, food, museums, villages, and other travel tips. It's full of color photographs and maps. There's a sturdy pullout map of Paris in the back. The pages don't seem as thick as older travel books. I would compare the page quality to magazines. Overall, it's a good source of information.",Positive
"My daughter and I went to Spain two years ago. When I was looking for a guide book to take with us, I was disappointed with the options available to us. While there were a few books out there, I couldn't find anything that was new and current. I settled on a DK book that was a couple of years old. This is a new updated book. The pages are not the highest quality - they seem almost like newsprint or thin magazine paper. However, the pages are full of beautiful color photos and maps. There are lots of interesting travel tips. There's a section on books and movies to watch before going, too. There's a sturdy, pull out map in the back. I tried looking up the places we went and not everything was included, but it does have a lot of information.",Positive
"I found The Moonshiner's Daughter to be a fascinating read. It's a historical fiction that takes place in 1960, North Carolina. The lead character, Jessie, is wanting to get out of the family business of moonshine. I found the whole story captivating and well written. It's paced well and I was able to read the book in just a couple of days. While I wasn't particularly happy with the ending, it was satisfying. This is the first book I have read by this author and would consider reading more by Everhart.",Positive
"I like to buy cookbooks, but most only have a few recipes that I'm interested in making. This one has lots of appealing recipes. My son, husband and I are following a Keto diet. My guys have marked several recipes that they want me to cook. I've tried a few so far and they've been pretty good. The recipes don't require a lot of specialized ingredients either.",Positive
"I started this and it took a while to get into the story. I'm not sure if it was a busy time for me or not, but it was a slow start. It does pick up speed and once I got into it, I didn't want to stop. The story is about an odd friendship between a young woman and a teenage fortune teller in Atlantic City. There's a serial killer on the loose and the fortune teller starts seeing images of the victims. The characters were interesting, but most of them were not likeable. I wasn't satisfied with the ending, though it does seem to wrap things up for the most part.",Positive
"I've been a fan of DK Eyewitness books for a long time. I really like the way they chunk the information. It's easier to read in bits and pieces. This is a good, informative travel guide on London. It contains a lot of history and other background info. It has a few different itineraries to get you started. The book gives you lots of things to do and places to go. Hours are provided, but it doesn't include admission prices, which frequently change. There are some suggestions regarding hotels and dining, but not very many. There are lots of color pictures and maps. In the back of the book, there is a pullout laminated map. The size of the book is good for traveling.",Positive
"While reading the book ""Why We Can't Sleep, Women's New Midlife Crisis"", I found myself over and over on the pages. Women in my age group were indeed experiencing the same worries and concerns I was. To that degree, I felt more ""normal"". The author wrote the book so it was easy to read with many women's voices and experiences. But one thing it is missing is a solution. Now we know why we don't sleep and that we're not alone, but what the book is missing is how to finally get some sleep!!",Positive
"I didn't want to put this book down! It grabbed my attention from the get-go. I finished it in a day. I would classify this as a chick lit book rather than a romance. The story starts when Dannie, is asked a simple question at a job interview - where does she want to be in 5 years. Shortly after that, something happens that causes her to doubt the path she's taking. Without giving anything away, she resists deviating away from her plans. I found it to be quite enjoyable!",Positive
"I thought this was going to be just a coffee table book about Barbie. It's so much more than that! It's a comprehensive biography of my favorite doll! Once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. The photographs and pictures are wonderful! I am a life long Barbie fan and found it to be informative and nostalgic. Some of the historical stuff was information that I had read before, but there were a lot of new tidbits as well. This is a must have book for any Barbie fan!",Positive
"My husband, adult son, and I have been following a Keto diet for the past couple of months. We've had some success with it, but we are missing carbs! This recipe offers several recipes that help with that. While you're not going to mistake these for traditional baked goods, the ones that I have tried have been a decent alternative. My family's favorite so far is the pumpkin bread. We made some cream cheese frosting for it and it was *almost* as good as the real thing. It didn't last very long and they have requested another loaf. The books looks all professional with easy to follow instructions and attractive photographs. I look forward to trying more of the recipes!",Positive
"This is another great historical fiction from the American Girl Line! It's the second book about Melody who is a young girl living in Detroit during the Civil Rights Era. It is well written and brings that time period to life. Melody has a passion for singing. Although it is a piece of fiction, it's based on a lot of true, historical events and does a good job of it. There are lots of beautiful illustrations throughout the book and some historical background information in the back of the book.",Positive
"This book has a slow start, but don't give up on it! About half way through, things speed up and get very exciting. The whole premise of the eccentric billionaire leaving behind a treasure hunt is pretty original. There were times where I couldn't put the book down, it was so exciting. There were a lot of descriptive paragraphs. I tend to gloss over things and then I discover that I've missed something and have to go back and reread. There is a ghostly presence in the book, but I didn't find it too supernatural or wacky. Overall, I did enjoy it!",Positive
The American Girl books do a great job of introducing historical events and eras to children. This book deals with a Hawaiian family in 1941. Their life is changed when Pearl Harbor is attacked. It's a sweet story about a family and their friends and how they deal with their unfortunate circumstances. I found this to be an entertaining story. I haven't read much about Hawaii during this time period and found it filled with lots of historical details. The illustrations are excellent and enhance the story.,Positive
"I am a fan of the historical American Girl books. They do a great job of bringing history to young readers. This book introduces us to Melody, a young African American girl in 1964.  She lives in Detroit during the early Civil Rights movement. In one chapter, she and her brother face racial discrimination on a shopping outing. The book is written well and tells an inspiring fictitious story based on accurately true events and situations. There is additional historical information in the back of the book that includes photographs from that era. There are beautiful illustrations to go along with the text. This book brings history to life!",Positive
"This American Girl kit is really cute! It has a book with craft ideas along with some paper/sticker activities. It also comes with a nice doll sized canteen. There are crafts for skiing, fishing, geo-caching, and other outdoor activities. There are instructions for making additional crafts (ones not included on the paper/stickers), but they do lack some specific details as well as step by step instructions. The kit states that some adult assistance is required, but that will depend on the age of the reader.",Positive
"This is another cute American Girl kit. The kit comes with 2 doll sized t-shirts. There are some stickers and stencils for decorating the shirts. The book shows how to decorate the shirts. In addition to using the stickers, it shows how to make felt decorations on the shirts and how to paint on them. The stickers aren't really reusable since they loose their stickiness. If you paint on the shirt or glue the felt to them, then the shirts can't be decorated again.  Younger readers may need some adult help, as mentioned on the back of the kit.",Positive
"I think the American Girl books are great for elementary aged kids. This one takes place in the 1970's which is when I was growing up, many years ago. It covers some historical information about that time period. It deals with divorce, which was pretty new back then as well as women's rights. I liked the story and found it engaging as well as entertaining.",Positive
"I thought this would be a great brain exercising activity for me! However, it was more difficult than I expected. My mother used to do these and did very well with them. I found them to be very challenging. I probably haven't done any cryptograms since I was in grade school. It's possible that I had to do them in middle school or high school math, but I don't remember doing them. Before you can solve them, you have to figure out what the key is. That's where I found it to be difficult. There are some tips in the beginning to help you get started, but after a few attempts, I lost patience and gave up. I then gave the book to my 18 year old daughter and she was able to solve the first one without much difficulty. I know we all have different gifts and talents and I can honestly say that solving cryptograms is not one of mine! I was pleased with the size of the print- it made it easier to work with. There are hints in the back as well as an answer key. If you're good at these kinds of puzzles, you'll probably enjoy it.",Positive
"I have read several of the American Girl books in the past, but I was unfamiliar with Mary Ellen and her story. This is an abridged/condensed version. It's an entertaining story, that touches upon some of the historical significance of mid 1950's. The book is illustrated nicely. I especially liked the ""Inside Mary Ellen's World"" in the back that had some photos and details about that time period. The story is a bit fluffy, but enjoyable.",Positive
"This is a fun & useful book for tween girls. It's geared toward girls, but most of the content would work for boys, too. It talks about planning trips, packing tips, and what to expect when you travel. There are several quizzes such as ""How adventurous are you?"" or ""What's your travel style?"". It is an easy read and has lots of illustrations to go along with it.",Positive
"This is a new updated American Girl Doll Hair Book/Kit. I remember my daughter having one several years ago. The kit comes with a small comb which looks like it would be good for parting hair, but not combing it, a headband, a hair clip, and some little rubber bands. The book starts with some general hair/doll care tips, then it has illustrated step by step hair styles. It does say on the back of the box, that an adult's involvement is needed for some or all of the activities in the book, which I'm sure depends on the age of the child.",Positive
"This is a delightful and entertaining story about a young girl living in Hawaii during World War II. While this is a fictional story, there are lots of historical details that bring this story to life. I have read some fictional books that took place in Hawaii during this same time period and found this interesting since it was from the point of view of a 9 year old girl. The illustrations are beautiful. There's a glossary in the back that has a lot of the Hawaiian words in it. Overall, it's a great book and not just for fans of the American Girl world.",Positive
"This is a fast paced book that I read in one afternoon. The premise was interesting. There's enough medical/scientific info that made it realistic, but not too much that I found it over my head.  I also felt that it was timely with the DNA testing kits which are all the rage. It was a little predictable at times, but still enjoyable nonetheless. It definitely makes you think regarding medical morality issues.",Positive
"The Wolf Wants In is a well written, page turner. I had a personal connection with this book. An old friend of mine recently died from addiction. She left behind two daughters who really didn't know their mother as she was absent most of their lives. While reading this, I couldn't help but think of my friend. The book actually gave me a little clarity and understanding to what my friend's life may have been like as an addict. The book alternates between points of view and timeline. The timeline was a little confusing for me. One POV was set 4 months earlier than the other POV. The timelines eventually catch up. But there were many times when I would have to work things out in my head before moving forward.  The book was labeled as a thriller, but I would classify it as more of a suspenseful mystery. Overall, I enjoyed this book.",Positive
"The Last Resort was not at all what I expected. I have been swept up in the psychological thriller genre recently and was expecting something along those lines. This is more of a drama/thriller. It seems like it could easily be a made for TV movie.  It takes on serious subjects such as #metoo, mental & physical abuse, and more. It was fast paced and easy to read within the space of a couple of days. I liked most of the characters except for the villain. There are some unexpected twists that keep it interesting. Overall, I enjoyed it.",Positive
"This is realistic and sweet story about a teen relationships. My 18 year old daughter read it this summer. There were a lot of parallels to her own life as she recently broke up with her boyfriend because of the whole going to college thing and not wanting to deal with a long distance relationship. While she did like the book, she didn't love it. She said that it was hard to like the main character. She found that the book was also hard to muddle through. She is working full time and reading it was a bit of a chore at times. She's read another book by this Adi Alsaid and really liked it, but felt that this one wasn't as strong of a story. But since she did like this a little, she wanted to make sure that I gave it 4 stars.",Positive
"The Family Upstairs is a suspenseful and fast paced story. A young woman, Libby, who was adopted as an infant,  inherits a house upon her 25th birthday. The story revolves around the happenings and mysterious circumstances that led up to the early abandonment.  The chapters are told in different perspectives, with one of them being Libby's. The other point of views are told by others who lived in the house during that time period. Part of the fun of the story is trying to figure out who those people are and what their involvement was. I did get a little confused with the jumping around. I wish the chapters listed the name of the POV or location/time period to help me keep things straight. It's not really a scary book, but I would categorize it as a suspense with some thrills. I read it from start to finish over the course of a couple of days.",Positive
"This was a quick read. Although flawed in many ways, I found it to be entertaining. I didn't really like any of the characters. The plot was familiar and reminiscent of old-school thriller/horror movies. A lot of it was predictable, but there were a few twists that surprised me. In the end, I was entertained and liked it.",Positive
"This is my first time reading a book by Megan Miranda. I found it to be quite the page turner! It took me a couple of chapters to get into it, but once it got going, I had difficulties putting it down. The story alternates between the present (well, 2018) and the summer before. The switch is obvious and marked, but there were a couple of times where I was confused for a few paragraphs. The book is suspenseful and has several twists. I really enjoyed it and now I want to check out some of Miranda's other titles.",Positive
"I have enjoyed all three of the books in the Rosie trilogy. While the first one remains to be my favorite, this one is pretty good. When reading these books, I can't help by picture the character Sheldon Cooper as Don. I work in special ed, specifically with autistic children and I find the mannerisms and vocabulary to be pretty spot-on. It took me a lot longer than it should have to read this title only because I had difficulties finding the time to sit and read. It was pretty easy to pick up and read a little here and there. It was probably a little longer than it needed to be, but I'm not sure what could be left out. Anyway, I found this to be enjoyable and entertaining.",Positive
"This book is about an average high school guy who does the minimum to get by. It's an interesting and entertaining story that gave a perspective of an often overlooked character. While I didn't personally connect with any of the characters, they were well developed. The book deals with topics such as drug dealing and cancer. The author does a great job with the relationships in the story. Overall, it's a good read.",Positive
"This is a creative and fresh story line. I found it to be very engaging and well written. I wasn't expecting the fantasy side of it. It loosely reminded me of the Time Traveler's Wife and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a little bit. I really enjoyed the details about Grand Central Station and found that to be very interesting. Overall, it's an entertaining read.",Positive
"This is a must read for all college students! It is full of some really good tips for college students. My daughter graduates from high school this week and I will be giving this to her to read over the summer. In the meantime, I've been enjoying it. It's an easy to pick up and read in chunks. It's not preachy or patronizing. It's a lot of matter of fact, sensible tips that cover taking tests, talking with your professor, time management, and summer school just to name a few. I think this would be an excellent graduation present for the college bound student.",Positive
"This is a timely story with its app development theme. This was an easy read, but it was a little boring at times. The characters were alright, but I didn't love any of them. I think the premise was good and it had a lot of potential, but in the end it fell short. I did like it (not love it).",Positive
"This is an interesting introduction to coding. It's not going to teach you how to code. Instead it gives you a historical journey through the world of coding. I'm not a coder. My husband is a programmer and my son is studying IT. I found this book to be very interesting and even informative. If you are an expert in the field, then this might not be the book for you, but for someone with very little prior knowledge, I enjoyed it.",Positive
"I will be forthcoming and share that I selected this book because of its cover. I know, that's not a good reason to pick a book, but I did it. I have not read any of Denton's other titles before. I found this to be steady reading. There's mild Christian bits, but not enough that I would consider it a Christian book. I found it enjoyable and over all a good read.",Positive
"This is a collection of empowering women's short stories. It's an easy book to pick up and read. The stories are entertaining and quick to read. Many of them are mystical/fantasy stories. As with all collections such as this, there were some that I liked and some that I didn't. It is definitely a creative selection of stories.",Positive
"I read Moloka'i a long time ago for book club and thoroughly enjoyed it. But since so much time as passed since reading it, I had not remembered much of the plot. As I read this sequel, some bits came back to me, but for the most part, I did not remember much about Rachel and her life. This book was well written, but it was very slow reading for me. I work full time and have a lot going on after work these days, so my reading time is limited. It was fairly easy to pick up/put down. The chapters were some what long, so I did have to stop mid-chapter at times. It covers a lot of American-Japanese history, specifically around World War 2, which was interesting. The slow pace picked up a lot after the war was over. Overall, I did enjoy it, but I did not like it as much as the first one.",Positive
"I love looking through travel books and deciding where to go on vacations. This book has some gorgeous photos which makes it a lot of fun going through it. There are several possible itineraries that hit several of the top destinations. In addition to the details about where to visit, there are also a lot of pertinent travel tips, specifically for China. The size is average when compared to other travel books.",Positive
"This was a fun, engaging book. It's about an unlikely friendship between a middle aged woman and a young 18 year old woman. As I am in the age range of the older woman, I found it to be especially interesting. There are some lovely descriptions about Paris that made me want to jump on a plane right away! It was my first book by this author and I would definitely consider reading something else by her.",Positive
"My daughter wasn't sure she would like this after she first started reading this. The conversations didn't seem natural or realistic in her point of view. But after she got past the first few chapters, she became interested and found herself reading it as much as her busy schedule permitted. She's a senior in high school and found the college aspect of it especially interesting. She liked the main girl, Cassie, who goes through a fraternity's rush. There's a lot of alcohol use in the book. She interviews a girl who has been sexually assaulted. There's hazing and some foul language, too. In my daughter's opinion, these topics were covered appropriately. Cassie is a strong female character who grows by the end of the book. It's definitely geared toward older teens. Overall, my daughter found it engaging and she enjoyed the book.",Positive
"This beautiful book is full of photographs and quotes from the former first lady. The photographs are lovely. Many of the quotes are inspiring, though they don't necessarily match the photographs they are paired along with. It's well done and a great addition to my personal library.",Positive
"My daughter is currently taking AP Biology. I ordered a year long guide book for her, but with only a couple of months left in the class, she's barely even cracked it open. This however, she has been devouring! It's great for when you have short periods of time to study. It's basically full of just possible AP Bio test questions. She has been taking this to school with her and going through it when's she finished with her work. She loves it so much, she's been recommending it to her classmates. It's helping her to pinpoint her weaknesses as well as her strengths. She's a senior this year, so she won't be taking AP classes next year. I wish I had discovered this series of test prep books earlier!",Positive
"This pyschological thriller is told from the perspective of the ""crazy ex-girlfriend"". Even though you know in the beginning that she is a bit unhinged (you get that from reading the book description), there are several times when I was sympathetic and hopeful for her. I was sucked in to the story line from the beginning and couldn't put it down. It's a fast paced story that's entertaining and compelling. Overall, I liked it and would recommend it to a friend.",Positive
"This book is a page turner! I found it difficult to put down. I read the whole thing over a weekend. I would classify it as a thriller with some paranormal activities. I'm not much of a fan of paranormal stuff, so I could have done without that, but nonetheless, I did find it engaging and entertaining. I partially predicted one aspect of the story, but most of it was surprising. There were some twists and turns that kept me reading. I would consider reading more from this author.",Positive
"I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella book for years. I found this to be an entertaining and engaging story. The story line is a bit familiar and predictable, but I still found it to be a page turner. Fixie, the main character, starts out as a weak, door mat kind of a person. She does find her back bone and inner strength. There are some misunderstandings, infuriating siblings, and a coffee sleeve in this romcom.",Positive
"I have been a fan of DK Eyewitness books since my children were little. I was so happy to discover shortly after being introduced to them, that the made travel books. Ever since then, their travel books have been my preferred travel books. This book is about half the thickness of my DK Spain book (2014) that I bought last year for a trip. Not only is is thinner, but the pages are not as heavy and thick nor the cover. The pages feel more like a high end newsprint where the pages in the Spain book are glossy coated. The cover of the Spain book is also glossy coated, whereas this one is not. The book is much lighter weight than the Spain one, but I really prefer the quality of the Spain one. The pictures stand out more in the Spain one because of the quality of paper. The content of this book is excellent, as expected. There are lots of pictures and details about the places and things to do in the city of Prague. There is a small phrase section, information on traveling around the city, and some other important ""things to know"". There are also lots of maps, including one that is laminated that you can remove from the book. Overall, it's a must have book for anyone traveling to Prague.",Positive
"This is a fascinating book about the Apollo missions to the moon. Each chapter is devoted to one artifact related to the missions. There are lots of photographs included with the interesting facts about the items. My husband has been a lifelong fan of all things space related and he found this to be informative and entertaining. It doesn't require that you read it from start to finish, in the order it's presented. You can easily jump around from chapter to chapter if desired. It's also easy to pick up, read a chapter, then set it down until later. This would make a great gift for anyone interested in earlier space missions to the moon.",Positive
"I am a cat person and I enjoy reading, when I can find the time. I've read a short holiday story by this author, but I have not read her well known book, Homer. I found this to be easy to read. I work full time and don't have as much free time to sit down and read, but this was easy to read in chunks of time.  It was engaging and descriptive. A lot of her stories were reIatable to me and my own cats. This would be great for cat lovers!",Positive
This is basically a nice little gift book filled with wisdom from Yoda. It's an official Disney DK collaboration. Each two sets of pages has a still movie picture on one side and some words of wisdom on the other side. A lot of the sayings remind me of positive inspirational work posters. I think this would make a great graduation gift along with some money. It's more of a light hearted kind of book rather than a serious one. My Star Wars fan husband found it amusing.,Positive
The Be More Vader book is a cute DK book that has all kinds of tips and advice for the adult world. A lot of it is geared toward work/business. It's an official Star Wars item. Each piece of advice is a 2 page layout with a photo from a Star Wars movie on one side and the advice on the other side. My husband has been a Star Wars fan since the start and he found it to be amusing. I think this would make a nice graduation gift for a Star Wars fan.,Positive
"My son delivers pizza, so I thought this would be a fun calendar for him! It comes in an envelope that resembles a pizza box which I thought was pretty clever. The images are great! Each month has a delicious looking pizza. The calendar squares are on the top and the pizza images are on the bottom. The calendar portion even has oil spots scattered about! There's not a lot of room to write things on it, but I know my son won't be writing a lot on his calendar, but it will let him to see the dates and track important items.",Positive
"I was unfamiliar with the ""My Encyclopedia of Very Important"" series by DK. My kids grew up on the bigger, thin DK books that were filled with photographs. I immediately noticed that this wasn't the same as the other series. However, it's still an excellent, quality book aimed at younger readers. There are illustrations as well as photographs. Text is larger than in the other books with basic, to the point information. The material is interesting and engaging. I found my 17 year old daughter reading it for over an hour the other day, so it can appeal to a wider audience. I would recommend this title and others in the series.",Positive
"It's been a few years since I've had a daily tear off calendar, so I was expecting it to be on a plastic base. This is not plastic - it's a cloth covered cardboard back/stand that looks really professional. The Sarah Scribbles cartoon pages are entertaining and fun. This would make a great gift for fans of the comic. My only criticism is that the print is a bit small and hard to read. I am not the target audience at 50, so that probably isn't an issue for the targeted age group (20's I would think). Overall, it's a great calendar and much nicer than I expected.",Positive
"This was a fun story that takes place over 9 years. I could definitely see this turned into a holiday chick flick! A lot of what happens is not fresh and new, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It's a fast paced story that alternates from the point of view of Laurie and Jack. Once I had the free time to read more than a chapter at a time, I couldn't put it down.  I would love to read something else by this author.",Positive
"I am an educator and thought that I knew all the major immigrants in our country. Boy was I wrong! I was only familiar with about a third of the people in this book. I found it interesting and entertaining as well as informative. Not only would children benefit from reading this book, but so would a lot of adults. Each of the 36 immigrants and refugees in the book have a one page biography and a illustration. In addition to the written mini-biography, there is also a box with interesting facts in a bullet point format. This is well written with great illustrations. I would have liked to have seen real photographs, too, but the illustrations are realistic. I am going to make my 17 year old daughter read this and then share it with my young nieces and nephew, whose father is a first generation immigrant.",Positive
"After a slow start, things picked up and it got to the point where I couldn't put this down. The story was original and new. A divorced couple go on a holiday vacation with their new romantic partners and their daughter. Early in the story, an accident is hinted at with the occasional foreshadowing in the form of police investigation interviews. I didn't really care for either of the men in this story, but the women were likeable. The daughter's imaginary friend grew tiresome and I was glad when that was resolved. It took me a couple of weeks to make my way through this because of the slow start, I just wasn't interested, But I'm glad I persevered and finished it because it was entertaining.",Positive
"My daughter read Everyday last year and was excited to learn that there was a sequel to it. There is a movie of Everyday which she has not seen yet. She definitely feels that you should not read this one without reading Everyday first. This book brought some closure to the first story, but it did not answer all of her questions. It does not explain the why behind the whole body &#34;traveling&#34; which she was hoping for, but it does briefly introduce that there are others who do the same thing. The point of view switches between all of the main characters, and a few lesser characters as did the original story. It was fast paced and she was able to read the whole book within a week or so, even with her busy schedule. The book goes into more depth of some characters that were in the first book, such Nathan and Reverend Poole as well as the A & Rhiannon. She found it entertaining, but she still wants to find out the whole why pertaining to the body traveling. She found the book concept interesting, but she did like the first book a little better.",Positive
"This is a fast paced and exciting thriller. A young small town cop works with an older ex-detective with a past to hunt down a serial killer. The book starts out strong with lots of details and background information. We don't even meet the ex-detective until almost half way through the story. Then the rest of the book is spent solving the crime/finding the serial killer. I felt that the second half deserved a little more attention. It seemed rushed a bit. In fact, everything was wrapped up rather quickly.  From start to finish it took about a day to read it. Overall, it was entertaining and I did enjoy it. It kept me engaged and interested.",Positive
"This YA book covers some serious themes, but does it pretty well. It gives an authentic voice to the lead, Arden. Her character is likeable and well written. I sometimes felt that there was too much going on, but that's just my opinion. It follows some of the usual YA formulas, but it didn't feel like it was the same story with just a different title. It's a quick read and overall entertaining.",Positive
"It took a while for me to get into the story, but once I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book is the sequel to &#34;I Don't Know How She Does It&#34; which was written about 16 year ago. Kate, the lead character, is approaching her fiftieth birthday and is going through perimenopause. I just turned 50 a few months ago and her descriptions about aging are spot-on. Kate's daughter, Emily is 16 and her interactions with her sounded very familiar to my own with my 17 year old daughter. Fortunately, my daughter hasn't gone through all of Emily's trials. There are many laugh out loud moments which may not be as funny for those who haven't experienced those aging milestones. One problem that I had with this book (and similarly with the first book, too) is that there are long periods of writing without any dialogue. I realize that's just a style of writing, but when I am reading books with that format, I tend to get sloppy with my reading and start skimming a lot. I blame it on the Speed Reading class I took back in junior high. Inevitably, I will sometimes miss something important and have to go back and reread parts to comprehend what's going on. Overall, it was a fast paced story with a realistic voice.",Positive
"I just finished this and I'm not sure what to think. Or should I say that I can't stop thinking about it. It was very easy to read. I would definitely classify it a psychological thriller. Even after reading it, I have doubts about what happened and who to believe. The story is about a 9 year old boy who lives alone with his housekeeper. His father is dead and his mother is in American trying to raise money for the family business. Although the ending was satisfying in my opinion, it left me with more questions. The book kept me engaged and guessing throughout. There are parts that seemed a little too familiar, possibly adapted or borrowed from other stories, but overall it was entertaining.",Positive
"This book reads pretty quickly. It's basically a bunch of memories told from the perspective of 3rd grader, Nenny. Some of the memories are connected, but others seem more random. The memories are short and separate like chapters.  In the beginning, there are some weird &#34;Fears&#34; dispersed in between a few of the chapters. At first I thought the fears were real and part of the story line, but quickly figured out that they were just a result of an over imaginative 9 year old. The book is set in the 80's, but most of the 80's story line is related to the current events. I was hoping for more 80's pop culture. Overall, it was enjoyable and entertaining.",Positive
"This was my first Beatriz Williams novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This novel is set in three different time periods - 1930, 1951 and 1969. It takes place on an east coast island. It's well written and very engaging. I didn't want to put it down. I had a little difficulties keeping all of the characters straight when the time periods changed and I would have to go back and reread parts to figure out who was who, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. There's romance, drama, secrets, and more. I am looking forward to reading other books by this author.",Positive
"Dead siblings seems to be a popular subject for YA books these days. This book is engaging and quick to read. It was a lot heavier than I expected, but enjoyable nonetheless. It deals with grief nicely and throws in a little romance, and some mystery to the mix as well. It's well written and entertaining. Overall, I would recommend this title to teens and adult fans of YA.",Positive
"I found The Everything Girl to be a captivating read. I actually enjoyed it more than The Devil Wears Prada that it has been compared to. There were a couple of characters that I actually liked, but most of them were unlikeable. The chapters are not too long which is important to me. I don't always have a lot of time to read, so I want to be able to pick up a book and come to a stopping point, like the end of a chapter, rather than stopping mid-chapter. The book is well written and fast paced. It says that real-life drama inspired the story which is horrifying to learn that there are real bosses out there like that. It was an entertaining and fun read.",Positive
"This was such a fun book to read! The story is about 5 women who are in a book club together. The book covers the course of 5 months. Each month is about one of the women. The life of each woman parallels that month's book club title. The books are all popular classic titles starting with Emma by Jane Austen. Because of that, there was some predictability now and then. The actual focus on the books is fairly minute. It's more about the women and their lives. The story is fairly fast paced. The chapters aren't too long so I found it easy to get to a stopping point when needed. The characters were likeable, though I did find it hard to keep track of everyone at times. I found it enjoyable and quite entertaining.",Positive
"I found the first book in the Riches to Romance series to be a fun book, so I was happy to read this one. After a slow start, this book quickly became hard to put down. Things basically picked up after the location change. It's a fun, romantic story set mostly in Ireland. Tara, the heroine, is a Southern belle from Charleston. Although I really did like her, I felt that some of her Southern attributes were a bit stereotyped and not realistic. The chemistry between Tara and the two men was well written and engaging. I do feel like things wrapped up a little too quickly and that the passing of time was too short. Supposedly a couple of months take place, but it came off as just a couple of weeks. Regardless, I did find it a fun, light and fluffy read. I definitely want to read the next one in the series.",Positive
"I found this book difficult to keep straight. There are several main characters and there's a lot of jumping around from character to character. The Muslim boy was my favorite character. He was the only character that was approachable, genuine and had good intentions. The whole story takes place over approximately one day, so it was slow moving. It requires a lot of descriptions to cover such a short time span, which the author does pretty well. The beginning of the school day, each character has a secret that doesn't get revealed until the end, so it appears that everyone is suspicious. The actual motives behind the bombing were a little unrealistic in my opinion, however, the topic is timely. Overall, it was interesting and entertaining.",Positive
"These are bright, cheery bookmarks for students. The librarian at the middle school where I worked last year kept a display of bookmarks for the students to take and use. These are comparable to the ones she would buy in bulk. They are lightweight and not particularly durable, but they do the job of marking one's place in a book. The edges are smooth without any perforations. These are perfect for school or classroom use and are appropriate for readers of all ages.",Positive
"This DK/Lego book is perfect for young girls (and boys). It's great for both genders to see successful women in science fields. When I was growing up, action figures, book characters, or anything space/astronaut related always showed astronauts as males. This book is filled with Lego graphics and interesting facts about some important women who are considered space heroes. This is a level 1 book so it is geared toward beginning readers. Some of the vocabulary words are higher levels, but all explanations are age appropriate. As an educator and a parent, I think this is a well written, interesting book.",Positive
"I am a big fan of Kristan Higgins and this book did not disappoint. School was closed due to bad weather, so I started reading it on my unexpected day off. I only put it down to read and sleep. Then the next day I finished it as soon as I got home from work. Nora, the heroine is a strong character with a lot of bad luck. She's not always unlucky, but she has had her share of bad things happen to her. While recovering from an accident, she goes back to her childhood home to stay with her mother. She has to come to terms with her past. Higgins creates a fascinating and intriguing story set in a small Maine community. She uses a lot of humor along with some romance. This has to be one of my new favorite books by Higgins.",Positive
"What a fun book! I kept putting reading it off, but once I sat down and picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I read the book from start to finish in about a day. The story is set in France. I found the descriptions of the scenery to be charming. The heroine of the story, Manderly is smart, well spoken, and interesting.  Xavier, the romantic interest, is almost too perfect. He's handsome, rich, and mysterious. There's a lot of French in the dialogue. Although I appreciate that the author wasn't trying to be accurate, I found that since I don't know any French, I would skip over those parts a lot. Then sometimes I would have to back track because I missed something. I was thoroughly entertained by this romance and I will definitely check out other books by this author.",Positive
"I haven't read any historical romances in a while, so this was a nice change of pace. The book is set during the during the later part of the Civil War in Missouri. I found it moved quickly and keep my interest. Abigail, the heroine of the story is a strong, independent woman. She meets a handsome Scottish man who helps her to safety after the death of her parents and attack on her family home. There's a lot of historical war activity as well as steamy romance.There was a lot more pre-marital sex than I have read in other historical romances, however it was all monogamous. Overall all, the book was entertaining and engaging. I look forward to checking out other books in this new series.",Positive
"This is an entertaining story about the life of a single woman and her experiences with online dating. Most of the chapters begin with some kind of texting or messaging with prospective dates. The dating life angle was fun and interesting. I did get a little confused at times with all the different characters. I had a week long break from the book at one time and had to go back an reread some parts to figure out how some of the people were. In addition to the many guys Alison dates during the year, there's also several friends, a brother, and co-workers to keep straight, too. I respected Alison and her dating limits. Overall, it was a cute story.",Positive
"This is the third book in the  &#34;For Your Love&#34; series by Shannyn Schroeder. It's a slow moving, but sweet romance. I thought the lead female character was a little boring, but I did like the leading male a lot. A lot of the characters from the first two books in the series are in this one, but for the most part, this is a stand alone title. The story doesn't have the typical conflict that must be resolved, it's more of a small hiccup. It's pretty steam as far as sexual content. Overall, I did like it.",Positive
"This is the second book that I have read in the Librarians in Love series. I enjoyed this one a lot more than Falling for Trouble. The main characters were more likeable in this book. The premise of the story one that's used a lot, but fun nonetheless.  Girl has a one night stand with hot guy with the intent of never seeing him again. Hot guy turns out to be the new lawyer where she works, so there goes that plan. Although I did like both of the main characters (and the supporting characters, too), I thought that Becky's reasons for not wanting to date Foster were pretty lame. Foster's so called faults weren't that bad in my opinion. Both Becky and Foster have dysfunctional families.  Madison, Foster's kid sister was the only family member that I liked. I loved the whole &#34;Dog Adoption Shelter&#34; story line. The ending was a little abrupt, but there was an epilogue that helped a bit. It was a quick read and very entertaining.",Positive
"It's a little early for Christmas romances, but I couldn't resist. This is a light, fluffy read. It follows a standard romance formula, but it entertains. The story is about a divorced, pregnant woman who returns to her hometown. She encounters her ex-boyfriend who is a widowed father. The romance is clean and sweet. There are some conflicts that get resolved a little too easily, but overall it was an enjoyable book.",Positive
"Prior to reading this, I was unfamiliar with the deadly London fog or Reg Christie. I read The Devil in the White City many years ago and loved it, so since this was compared to it, I wanted to give it a try. The subject was interesting and well researched. It was a bit slow and choppy at times. I felt that it jumped around a lot to the point that it confused me every now and then. It didn't have the flow that The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson. I don't usually read nonfiction books, but Larson's book read like a novel. I didn't feel that I was reading nonfiction. This one didn't read as easily. There were a few times where it resembled fiction, but most of the time it felt like I was reading something for school. Overall, I did like it. It was informative and interesting.",Positive
"The description of this book was very enticing.  It started a bit slowly, but by the end, the pace quickened and I did have problems putting it down. I actually had to set a timer to break away from it at one point because I had to be somewhere and I didn't want to stop reading. The main characters were likeable, but a bit dull. The stalker/killer narrates the end of every couple of chapters. I was a little confused at times because there are a lot of characters, but that was probably to give lots of  possible suspects and keep the reader guessing in this romantic suspense. This was my first book by Alexandra Ivy and I was entertained by the book.",Positive
"I've been a fan of DK Smithsonian books since my kids were young. This one is just as incredible as the other ones we have purchased over the years. The pictures and diagrams are detailed and interesting. I personally spent over an hour perusing through it when it first arrived. It gives thorough explanations on how our bodies work. I learned more than a few things about the human body from this book. The book is geared toward 4th - 7th grade, but I think it is appropriate for older grades and adults, too. I like that it has a &#34;matter of fact&#34; approach to our bodies and doesn't try to make it cute and funny.",Positive
"My nineteen year old son and husband both read this. The illustrations were fine and the quality was comparable to other DC graphic novels they have read. The story was a bit jumpy, but it was engaging. My husband liked it more than my son did. He said it reminded him of some of the older comics he has read. They both said it was not appropriate for kids, but there is a warning for mature readers on it. Neither of them are particularly interested in reading more in the series.",Positive
"I found it strange that a book that deals so much with a funeral home and undertakers could be so enthralling! This is my first book by Sara Blaedel. It was very fast paced and I read it all over two days. The main character, Ilka, goes to the US for the reading of her late & estranged father's will. She inherits a funeral home and all the responsibilities that go with it. The descriptions of the funeral world were pretty detailed and interesting. I didn't really care for Ilka, but I found her to be an engaging character. There is a mystery of sorts that takes place. Ilka doesn't really have anything to do with the mystery or the solving of it other than working at the funeral home. A lot of the content was a bit bland, but it was well written and I kept wanting to read it anyway.  I was disappointed that everything doesn't get wrapped up in the end and instead it ends with a &#34;to be continued&#34;. Depending on how long a wait there is until the next book, I will probably read it for my much needed closure.",Positive
"What a story! It's been a while since I've read a complete saga. Lately, I've been reading fluff, so I am pleased to have chosen something a little more substantial this time. From the first chapter, I was hooked. I read this over the course of a week, with the last few days completing the bulk of it. The book has an interesting approach of telling the life story of Cyril. It jumps in increments of 7 years, starting with the time before his birth and leading up to his arrival, all the way to a few months before his death as an old man. I found it compelling and engaging throughout the whole book. It brought out several different emotions as I read it. There were times when I pitied Cyril. There were things that angered me. And there were times that made me laugh. It sort of reminded me of Angela's Ashes - but that may just be the Irish Catholic thing. I am so glad that chose this as one of my summer reads.",Positive
"This is my first Julie Garwood book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a fast paced, engaging story that I didn't want to put down. The first chapter was a bit confusing to me. A lot of characters were introduced and I had to keep rereading parts to keep them all straight. But once I got into the story, I didn't have that issue any longer. There's a lot of FBI action. There were several different conflicts taking place.  It is pretty steamy at times, but that's not the main focus of the story. I started reading this one evening, but stopped after a couple of chapters. I picked it up the next day and didn't put it down until I was done. This is a great summer read!",Positive
"It was a quick read, but definitely a little on the weird side. It was predictable, but still entertaining. The story is told in two different perspectives - the two best friends. The other reviews comparing it to a Mean Girls type plot are pretty accurate. There's catfishing (Cyber Bulling) and a lot of sexual reference, but there's not any actual sexual activity. One of the girls is obsessed with losing weight, hence the kale smoothie angle. I've read other books by this author and this is geared toward an older audience than the Pink & Green books. They didn't act like near seniors, but younger high school such as freshman or sophomores. There was a lot going on at times making it too busy. Overall, I was entertained by it even though there were some flaws.",Positive
"I was unfamiliar with the author and not sure what to expect at all, but  I was pleasantly surprised with this book. It was fast paced and engaging. I've been busy, so my reading time was limited, but I made a point to carve out some reading time every day for this. The characters were well developed. They weren't too predictable. There is a lot of description and often there would be multiple paragraphs without any dialogue.I tend to gloss over those at times when I'm short on time, so there were some occasions when I had to go back and reread a little because I missed an important detail. I didn't always agree with the paths that the lead character was taking, but overall she was likeable and I enjoyed reading her story. I will definitely be checking out other books by Bethany Chase.",Positive
"I am a former elementary school teacher, but I am currently a paraprofessional in a middle school special education classroom.  It is a mild intellect class, so the kids have low reading levels. The reading levels are slightly higher than most of our students with lexiles in the 500-600s range, but for guided reading that's okay. There are 6 sets of 6 cards. Each card is heavy weight and laminated. I was impressed with how sturdy they are! They have lots of great photo illustrations which are interesting and engaging. The non-fiction subjects are appropriate. Half of the cards are science themes and the rest of social studies. There are teacher cards that go along with these with general questions to ask of the students. There are no answer keys, but the questions are general enough that there are several possible correct answers. These will help a lot with summarizing non-fiction text! The classroom teacher that I work with loves this set so much, that she plans to purchase some of the other guided reading sets available.",Positive
"After the first few chapters, I was nearly ready to give up. The main character, was unlikeable. She had no redeeming qualities at all. But, the story is just like one of those sappy holiday movies on the Hallmark Channel where she goes through a quick transformation. And by the end of the story she has become a decent person. All this happens in the course of a few days. The book is fast paced and even though I didn't care for the lead, I was engaged and quickly devoured it. It's not realistic, but it was entertaining.",Positive
"This is not your typical romance at all. The main character is a recent widow. She drinks a lot so she doesn't have to feel anything. There were times when I didn't really like her, but other times I wanted her to find happiness. The hero of the story has his own problems and issues. He's a Hollywood actor and just as screwed up as she is.  In addition to excessive drinking, there's a lot of swearing - especially the &#34;f&#34; word. There's some sexual content, but it's not too graphic. Overall,  I thought it was well written and engaging. I started reading a couple of chapters a day, but then on the third day, I couldn't put it down.",Positive
"My teenage daughter got to meet Adi Alsaid at a book signing a year or two ago, but never got around to reading his book. She really enjoyed this book so much, that she has started reading the previous one. The book starts on the day of the death of the main character's brother.  The book is about moving on and accepting the death of his brother. The main character and the brother were very likeable. It was well written and easy to get into. It kept my daughter's attention and she was engaged throughout the whole book. It ended satisfactorily and wasn't what was expected. Every chapter started with cooking and a list of ingredients. It was a fun, easy read.",Positive
"First of all, this was not what I expected after reading the summary of the book. It was very interesting and not cliche' as first expected. It did take a little while to get into the story. It was a little confusing in the beginning, too. The pace is a bit slow. There is reference to drugs, sex, and alcohol. The main character is flawed and well written. I was torn between giving it a 3 star or 4 star review, but in the end I decided that it deserved 4 stars. It was entertaining and that is one of my ultimate goals of reading.",Positive
"I ordered this for my teenage daughter for Christmas. First of all, this was not at all what she expected. She thought it was going to be a high school romance, but it is more science fiction. The marching band details in the book were spot on. My daughter felt that the author was talking about her school marching band. There's time travel mixed with marching band. The main character is quirky and likeable.  It wasn't a happy, perfect ending, but it worked out well and was satisfying. It starts off nicely paced, but there are some slower parts. By the end, my daughter couldn't put it down.",Positive
"This is a fast paced, fun mystery. The plot line was clever and interesting. There are lots of twists and it keeps the reader guessing until the end. The characters were well written and likeable. The book eludes to more books about the protagonist in the future. The book does have drug use in it, and  cover serious topics. It's definitely geared more to high school students or older teens. Overall this is an entertaining and interesting book. And once the story ends, everything that happens makes a lot more sense.",Positive
"My teenage daughter read this in one day. She took it to school and read it whenever she had a chance and then finished when she got home. She enjoys reading, but lately hasn't been reading much at all. It was easy to get into right from the start and quick paced. She's read books about blind characters before, but this one is fresh and from a different perspective. The characters were cute and likeable. It was not predictable and kept her interested for the whole story. My daughter would love to see more books about these characters.",Positive
"This is my first book by Lori Foster. When I first started reading, life was busy, so I was reading a chapter here and there. Sometimes there were large spaces between reading. There are a lot of characters in it and because I wasn't reading it regularly, I found it very confusing. I couldn't keep everyone straight. I don't think that would be as much of a problem if I had been reading it over a short time period. It actually took me over three weeks to read it because of my lack of free time. I was able to carve out some time to finish it this past week. It's a light, fluffy romance. I found it to be fairly predictable. There's a lot going on in it which probably led to some of my confusion. In addition to the main romance, there was a secondary romance going on, too. The conflicts were milder than a lot of romance plots, which was kind of refreshing. In that respect, it was more realistic. Sometimes there's so much drama, a story is more like a soap opera than real life. Most importantly, it was entertaining. I liked the characters and am interested in reading the next book with these characters.",Positive
"I am a big fan of Kristan Higgins and her books. I have read several of her romances and follow her on Facebook. I would classify this as chick lit. This title was a little slow to get started, but it picked up quickly to the point that I could not put it down. It's a fast paced story about two sisters who are dealing with the loss of their significant others. One becomes a widow after a few months of marriage while the other ones gets dumped by her boyfriend of ten plus years. The sisters are brought together by their sudden singleness and become closer as a result. The descriptions and details in the story are wonderful! The story is witty and charming with some laugh out loud moments. I was thoroughly entertained and was even teary eyed (happy tears) at the end, which never happens to me.",Positive
"This is my second book in Stacey Shannon's Kowalskis series. This title could easily be a stand alone title. There are lots of other characters in it that have been introduced in previous titles. I was confused a little bit in the other one that I read, but the main characters in this are not Kowalskis, so I found it not a problem in this one. I really liked this book a lot. It's definitely a formula romance, but there are a lot of fresh and new elements to it that I didn't feel like it's something I've already read. I also appreciated that there wasn't a huge dramatic misunderstanding or event that separated the two love interests. I found that to be more true to life. There is a lot of ATV activity which doesn't really interest me, but I still enjoyed the story. I found it entertaining and fast paced.",Positive
"This is my first book in &#34;The Kowalskis&#34; series. It's number 7 in the set. It is a stand alone book, but since I haven't read any of the others, I felt a little lost and overwhelmed with all of the characters - the Kowalskis are a big family! The story started off slowly, but it does pick up somewhere around the middle. The main characters were described well, but some of the others who were probably introduced in the other titles, were not described enough for me which led to my confusion with them. I liked the main characters well enough, but I did feel that Liz was a little weak sometimes. The plot is a familiar one - boy falls in love with best friend's little sister,  but best friend would not approve, so the two sneak around and try to fight the feelings that they have.There's humor, romance, camping/outdoors, and a little bit of heat.  Overall, I did find it entertaining and I did enjoy it.",Positive
"The book is a nice quality paperback one with gorgeous color pictures. There are lots of cats featured with the different projects. Each project includes step by step directions with illustrations. I'm not particularly good at reading & understanding complicated directions, but these are detailed enough with still being simple and easy to follow. Most of the projects are just cardboard boxes that have been cut and trimmed to different shapes. There are three that are actual cat scratchers, which is what I personally need in my home. I wish more of the other projects incorporated the cardboard scratch pad feature. There's a &#34;meet the model&#34; section in the back which is a fun addition.",Positive
"I work as a teacher's aid in a special education middle school classroom. Our class is a self contained, MID class. Our students range from abilities, but they are all lower intellects. They all have troubles with reading and read at beginning levels. I'm a former elementary teacher and when I started working as an aid last year, I suggested that we use phonics reading sets to work with all of the kids. I collected a few sets last year and we had some success with them. I wanted to get something new for this year, so I found this set. One of the biggest issues with our students is finding material that is interesting to them. They are teenagers and a lot of the phonics sets are too babyish for them. These books are fun and interesting to them. We're not reading things like &#34;see the cat&#34;. The stories are engaging to them. Most of the vocabulary is okay. They do struggle with some of the names of the turtles, but some of the kids are familiar with them already, so their prior knowledge helps them. I wish there were more sets like this with the appeal to older kids.",Positive
"I found this to be a quick, easy read. I really wasn't sure what I was getting into in the beginning. It starts with the heroine kidnapping the best man and taking him to her grandparents' old cabin. She came off as very flighty and wacky. Though after a few chapters, it normalized and I started to like her. It was fast paced. There are some very funny, laugh out loud scenes with the elderly neighbors. I was happy with how the story ended.  My main purpose for reading is entertainment and I found this book to be entertaining.<br /><br />*I received this book for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",Positive
"This is my first experience with grayscale coloring. As far as the coloring book goes, the paper quality is adequate. The images are okay - some are definitely clearer than others. It's hard to tell if some of them are blurry or if it's the result of the creature's scales, but some of the images have a pixelated look to them. I think the whole concept of grayscale coloring is neat. I just used colored pencils for my first attempt. It was alright, but I didn't have the results that I was hoping for. I plan to play around with other mediums. I think something that is blendable will be good.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My thoughts and opinions are my own.",Positive
"I love Kristan Higgins books and this one did not disappoint. Let me start by saying that I read for fun. I want to be entertained. I am not nit picky about the depth of characters or details about the plot. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it started out slowly. But after the first few chapters it does pick up and I had difficulties putting it down. I stayed up late just to finish it. I found the characters to be likeable. That's important to me. The chapters alternate between the two sisters' point of views. I started out liking Jenny better than Rachel, but by the end, I grew to like Rachel, too. I follow the author on FB and the book sounds just like her! Higgins is quirky and funny and so was this book. Yes, there's a little bit of language, but it's not excessive by any means. I think it just makes it more realistic. Both sisters go through some personal growth and I was happy for them both in the end. I purchased this book months ago and I am sorry that it took me so long to find the time to read it.",Positive
"My teen daughter takes Graphic Design courses at her high school. She gets the chance to create t-shirt designs and then silk screen them onto shirts. I ordered this shirt so she would have one the next chance she gets to make a shirt. The blue of the sleeves matches her school colors perfectly. I ordered her a size small and it fit very well on her. It's a men's shirt, so it's not fitted, but it's not oversized or baggy either. The shirt is well made with securely sewn seams and no loose threads. It's thick enough that it's not see through, which I prefer!<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",Positive
"This was a sweet story. It was a little slow paced, but to be honest, that could have been due to my busy schedule and limited reading time. I thought it was pretty tame for a Blaze story, but it was entertaining, nonetheless. The characters were well developed and the story was well written. I liked the use of &#34;twin mix up&#34; in the story.",Positive
"I ordered this for my 17 year old son who is taking a drawing class this year at school. The paper is a heavyweight & definitely considered premium. The spiral binding is strong & high quality. He has decided that it's not large enough for his school work, but he is using it at home and is very pleased with it.",Positive
"Several of my friends from my book club recommended this book to me and I finally had some free time to sit down and read it. It was an engaging story about a young woman in the 1770's trying to save her family farm. There were some religious references & lots of prayers to God, but it wasn't preachy by any means. The story was fast paced & had plenty of adventure as well as romance. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The characters were likeable & I am looking forward to reading the next story Feeding on Ashes.",Positive
"I had a little trouble getting into the story at first, but once I did, I didn't want to stop. The lead characters both have memory loss of the previous night & it takes a while for them to reunite which I found to be a little frustrating! The characters were likeable. The heroine was a strong, female, not at all wimpy.Overall it was a fun, easy read.",Positive
"This title was selected by my Book Club as one of our reads this year. Our theme was &#34;Georgia Authors/Subjects&#34;. Prior to reading this book, I was pretty indifferent about Paula Deen. I regularly make a couple of her recipes and I've been to her Savannah restaurant, but that's about the extent of it. I neither liked nor disliked her. After reading her biography, I can honestly say that I like her a whole lot more. Her life was not an easy one and she rose above all of her life's challenges and became very successful. It's written in her Southern Voice which was a little difficult for me because of the intentional misspellings and grammar issues, but it is effective. She is honest and shares all the good, the bad, and the ugly. It was an easy book to read and at the end of each chapter there's a recipe. There are a lot of photographs in the center of the book that I kept referring to as I read. Of course the book ends several years before all of the ugliness that surfaced in the media a few years ago. Maybe there will be an updated version later.",Positive
"This was my first book by Emily Liebert. The first couple of chapters started a bit slowly in my opinion, but it picked up quickly. The 3 main characters were interesting & very different from one another. As I read, I would change my mind about which character I liked best. They all had their share of faults. I was excited to learn their secrets! They were not what I expected. I had a little difficulties relating to some of the behavior, such as excessive drinking, but maybe my life is a bit quiet! Overall, I thought it was an easy read and entertaining book and I would definitely consider reading another book by Liebert.",Positive
"I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter who is a huge Coldplay fan. She's been playing the cello for almost 3 years. The music was simple enough for her to play, but not too elementary that it didn't challenge her. She was super excited by the selection of songs. She has not used the CD with it yet. She was so thrilled to receive this book that she actually practiced her cello on Christmas day!",Positive
"This book just got better and better as I read it and stands as one of the best-written of any I've read, both for style and content. Its interpretation of historical events and people was outstanding. It's entertaining approach to an interesting time in English history, using good storytelling to bring alive a real story of good people and treacherous times.",Positive
"this is a fun fantasy read, along the lines of Tolkien, to some extent",Positive
"as in my review of a similar winter greeting card, this is a nice design for a non-religious winter greeting card.  Nice quality, especially at the discounted price I paid.  [[ASIN:1593591241 Frosty Tree Holiday Boxed Cards (Christmas Cards, Holiday Cards, Greeting Cards)]]",Positive
"I hadn't known of Bernard Cornwell until I found this series, which I have enjoyed thoroughly.  Starting iwth this book, I now know much more abut the time of Alfred the Great, as seen through the eyes of Uhtred--son of a Danish mother and Saxon father.  Just that combination during these times when the Saxons and Danish/Norse invaders/settlers struggled for dominance of the British Isles was a good indicator of the complexity that develops in this character.  As a child of a local Saxon chieftan or lord, he was captured by the Danes when his father was killed and his uncle subsequently stole the stronghold and power due Uhtred.  He was brought up as a son of the Danish chief, learning Danish ways and thoroughly adopting their lifestyle and religion.  However, he became 'stuck' in defense of Alfred and his ambitions of becoming overlord of a Saxon 'England'.  Uhtred was a powerful fighter, having learned how the Danes approach battle fearlessly, and his skills were leashed by Alfred, despite Uhtred's dislike of the man personally.  This first installment of the series builds the story that was not a weak or boring one through all the books that followed.  Without a strong appreciation of the history of the times, unequaled description of how battles were fought strategically and shifting alliances could compromise territorial ambitions of the leaders, as well as strong character development of the principles, such a long series can't sustain interest.  Cornwell did not disappoint me in any part of the long saga.  In fact, this book, as the intro to this talented historical writer, led me to search out his other books of the European genre (medieval period) and I've now read every one and eagerly await what may come in future.",Positive
"I'm a long time fan of CI and this book was a great partner to my new slow cooker.  I thought I wouldn't ever buy another 'crockpot', so never paid much attention to the recipes in CI or Cook's Country (same bunch of folks), but I am sold!",Positive

"In the book “Animal in Suits” by Timur Raad, the book speaks about life working in corporate jobs. As mentioned in the book name, “Animal in Suits”, Animal represents people that are in suits working in corporate jobs. In the beginning we see that the protagonist Jake, talks about the world of working in a corporation with loads of work, his coworkers, and his personal life. The characters in the book are represented as “The Box-On Top” which showcase the social hierarchy that is being presented in the book instead of using the words like manager, directors, human resources, etc. Jake’s personal life was miserable because all Jake thought about was his work instead of giving time to himself. When the book reaches the ending, Jake realizes what his goals were and what he wants to accomplish. In my opinion the book is interesting in the way that Timur Raad has started off with the protagonist describing the work environment and the characters in the book then leading towards the ending of a goal that the protagonist wants to achieve.<br />- Michelle.

"This book was recommended to me by my brother. I added it to my ever-growing “to be read” list and forgot about it for a few weeks. Then, as if the book desperately wanted to be read, every shop that I went into there it was staring me in the face. Finally, I came across a copy in a second-hand shop and figured I had to get it.<br /><br />This book grabs your attention from chapter one, or should I say, day one; seeing as the main protagonist Aiden will wake up each day as someone new. This got a bit confusing to start with and took me a while to get my head around the concept but by “day three” I was totally emersed and couldn’t put it down.<br /><br />The book opens with a dark and rainy night in a forest where you are thrown into the action and introduced to the narrator, a man with amnesia; lost and alone in the woods and one name on his lips…”Anna”. The only problem is that he doesn’t know who this Anna is, no matter how much he wracks his brain. His friend? His wife? His daughter?<br /><br />He glimpses a woman in a black dress, running for her life with a pursuer crashing through the foliage after her. He tries to chase after them but her cries for help are cut short but a gunshot that rings out in the darkness. He is too late. And so begins the incredibly original and unique “The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle”.<br /><br />This book is full of more twists and turns than an Agatha Cristie novel. This is author Stuart Turton’s debut novel as I cannot wait to see what else he has up his magical sleeves.",Positive
"The main character called Maxim and he happens to have a rather large house and estate in Cornwall with a house keeper called ""Danny""... anyone else getting ""Rebecca"" by Daphne du Maurier vibes?<br /><br />In her new novel ""The Mister"", we first meet Maxim Trevelyan, an English earl with a newly inherited estate in Cornwall following his elder brother's unexpected death, whose first page of interior monologue is a narcissistic ode to “mindless sex"". Not exactly the best way to try to make the reader feel anything other than loathing for the main character and unfortunately he doesn't get much better.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, Maxim, a 28-year-old aristocratic playboy whose elder brother Kit has just died, is now obliged to step in and start fulfilling his role as heir to the Trevethick estate (get used to that name as it is almost a regular occurrence on every page). He is irritated by his inheritance as that means giving up his nocturnal habits of playing house music at nightclubs in Hoxton (a trendy part of east London for hipsters and creatives) and using his good looks to sleep with in his words, “hot, skinny women.” But one morning his world is unexpectedly turned upside-down even more when his regular maid is replaced by Alessia Demachi, whose entrance jolts Maxim into an uncharacteristic pattern of keeping his P in his pants. As it turns out Alessia not just a cleaner but an illegal immigrant from Albania that is trying to escape her ""previous life"" and she is about to drag Maxim into her dark world.<br /><br />This is definitely a case of don't judge a book by it's cover (which was what caught my eye and made me buy the book). If only the story line was half as interesting as the cover it would have been worth the money paid and the time wasted reading it.",Negative
"When the economy tanks in Whiskey Creek, Georgia, hairstylist, Jolene Claiborne expands her business to include skin care. A wise move until Scarlett Cantrell, a local celebrity, is murdered in the facial room. The police brush aside Jolene’s suspicions that the incident is tied to a recent break-in, and to complicate matters, the victim's ghost threatens to make Dixieland Salon her permanent place of residence if Jolene fails to expose the killer.<br /><br />Scarlett’s last words provide the only clue: “Find the jade elephant. Explains everything.” That is until a book of poetry turns up with a dangerous secret inside. Dealing with a diva ghost ain’t easy in the Bible belt. Throw in a sexy police detective, a crooked mayor with connections to the mob, a family cover-up, a mother who hasn’t cut the apron strings, and you get one stressed out middle-aged hairstylist with murder and mayhem on the brain.<br />A big thank you to NetGalley and Wild Rose Press for my copy of Dixieland Dead by  Penny Burwell Ewing.<br /><br />A fun and original read with a host of sassy Southern characters and a fabulous plot full of mystery, romance, humour and a self-centered ghost, what’s not to love? Although note to reader: you may want to put off that facial appointment you have until you have read this book…<br /><br />Very much looking forward to reading more in this series!",Positive

"I got this and two other joke books for my poor, “bored” and quarantined 15 year old. I hear giggling when he’s reading it so it must be good. I asked him “whatcha laughing about?” The reply is “just reading a book, mom.”<br />  When you can keep a book in the hands of a 15 year old boy, whose sole purpose in life is to be the greatest gamer in the world, you deserve a medal or a trophy! He remembers the jokes. That means he’s capable of remembering things like trash day. Thank you for keeping a book in his hands!",Positive
"I love the story line but hate how tightly packed the paper is on this book. There is nearly no “give” and it’s hard to read and hold. Stephen King delivers on the horror though and just by doing the most mundane thing, like walking.<br />  When you add 100 teenagers, a walking marathon followed by an armed guard, you’d think it’s a well-protected marathon. But the guard is there to make sure they keep walking.  The last kid walking is the winner, but of what?! It’s a book worth reading, just get a different style of book.",Positive
"This story takes place in a small, rural Australian town called Durton.  Durton Creek is called ""Dirt Creek"" because it is shallow and muddy.  We know early on that twelve year old Esther Bianchi is dead because the narrator(s) of the first chapter open with this.  They are ""We,"" a group narrator, not quite omnicient, but telling parts of the story as a group.  In Dirt Creek, we eventually can put together a linear story of Esther's disappearance on her way home from school; the discovery of her body four days later; and how pair of specialists on missing children, Detective Sergeant Sarah Michaels and ""Smithy,"" a Constable working with her find out what happened.<br /><br />What makes this an exceptional novel is not that linear story, which is beautifully written and makes us long for lively Esther to be found alive even though we know she will not.  We become attached to her best friend, Ronnie (Veronica) and her single mom who has never revealed her father's identity.  They have taken on Lewis, a classmate suddenly rejected by the other boys because he is effeminate/different.  He eats lunch with the girls.  Scrivener builds each child's family, extended family, townspeople and the town itself chapter by chapter.  They are totally engrossing.<br /><br />Esther and Ronnie, as usual, walked partway home from school that day and split up at the church.  Esther was never again seen alive.  Children are questioned, old conflicts are exposed, we spend time in each of the three children's homes, finding out their secrets, the parents' fears, how they are being raised and whether that has anything to do with the death. Esther's mother, Constance, never wanted to move to Durton.  Her husband Steve suggested they move to his hometown, where their daughter could walk to school and experience the small town childhood he recalled.  The spoilers would come in this case, by discussing the evidence and suspects.  Everything matters, in one sense:  You cannot rebury what is revealed about the town or the people once it's revealed.  And yet, some answers are not provided. In conclusion,  ""We"" reflects on what it all means and tells us who this group narrator is.  This is a dreamy book, put together with alternative narrators/points of view.  These include Ronnie and Lewis, Constance, Sarah and ""We.""  I appreciated this structure and the fact that once more, an author has brought a small town with its uniqueness to life so that I am drawn to the originality and the sameness of small town novels.  I strongly recommend this novel.",Positive
"It is 2019. Kat is the successful daughter. Flora is the one that married and has a four year old son who's a bit of a terror.  And Laurie is the damaged one whose mother, Dixie, recently died.  Charles Finch, their father, was a renowned artist and renowned philanderer.  The women each have a different mother.  Flora's mother was married to Charles when she was born.  Kat was born five months later to Charlie's lover. Lauren was born thirteen months after Kat.  During the summer, Kat and Flora joined Charlie and his parents at Rock Point, their Victorian summer home by the sea in Wales.. Lauren did not meet her Granny and Grandpa or her sisters until she was nine, when Dixie let her join them at Rock Point.  Charlie has issued something of a command that the three of them come to Rock Point.  Bertha, the  African Gray parrot, formerly their grandparent's bird is back.<br /><br />It has been twenty years since the daughters visited Rock Point.  In 1999, the summer of a complete solar eclipse, something bad happened at Rock Point.  1999 was the summer the sisters sat for a portrait, now recognized as Charles' Finches' masterpiece, ""Girls and Birdcage.  Rock Point is atmospheric, the young teen aged girls' relationships with one another complicated.  Kat and Flora have known each other from birth and are very close.  They can be kind or terrible to Laurie. Laurie assists her father with his studio and hangs out with local girl, Gemma whose mother cleans for them.<br /><br />Through the point of view of each daughter the stories of the return to Rock Point and the events of 1999 spool out in a dual timeline, Tension, some competitiveness and love play through the present.  Everyone is worried about Lauren who was already fragile and now mourns Dixie.  Flora is exasperated with her son's antics and loves him fiercely.  Her husband wants a second child.  It's obvious she is uncertain. Kat is on the phone constantly for business and seems lost in that world.  Charlie explains why he has called them all there and it's unsettling.  Throughout, each is thinking about 1999.  How can they not, when they haven't returned since then?  And someone is leaving them vaguely threatening notes.  But why?<br /><br />All in all I found The Birdcage an enjoyable read, particularly the characters, their interrelationship, their locale and the persistent air of mystery.  Obviously that part of the book is not action packed.  We are in the minds of each daughter.  I like that.  There is more action in the telling of the past and in the wrap up, but there are many ways to spoil the story, which I do not do in writing about my reads.  I strongly recommend this if this description grabs you.",Positive
"Bern and Melvin met in Philadelphia in the early 1960s and fell in love, but things go seriously awry and they must flee the United States, chased by an FBI agent as they head to Ghana where Mel's old college roommate is now President Nkrumah.  Twisted into this adventure is the reality that Nkrumah's power is against the USA's political interests as he has aligned with the Russians. A coup is in the works. Further twisted into this adventure are some mystical scenes surrounding Bern's heritage that is somehow tied in with mermaids and water; Melvin and Bert joining with a famous musician who has also had a key encounter related to water and a mermaid; and their journey, with the band,  toward President Nkrumah during chaotic and dangerous times and chaotic and dangerous weather.<br /><br />Bazawuie crafts a compelling tale and plays the mystical parts just right.  I did not find myself liking any of the characters at all.  Yet the characters were compelling. Bern is the least unlikeable and presents a strong independent female persona who is most interesting as a child when her grand ma dies.  It is rather unclear what she ever saw in Melvin, who is sympathetic in some ways but also seems to be a mess from the start.  Oddly, the FBI agent chasing Bern and Melvin is someone you -- don't necessarily root for -- but you take an interest in how he will make out.  While there is humor in this novel, there is also violence and pain.  I would say my primary emotional reaction to it was mild depression.  Interesting. Worth reading. Really well told/written.  But hard to finish and feel fully satisfied.",Positive
"Sad. NOT funny. But DESERVES four stars.  I finished it BECAUSE it was well written, but I would not have read it had I known what was coming.<br />Some of the blurbs at the beginning of One's Company called it a Black Comedy.  I did not laugh once.  In fairness, the novel is well written, hangs together, has some great characters and Bonnie Lincoln and how she proceeds when she wins a bazillion dollar lottery is amazingly wrought.  But it is a sad, introspective book about a very damaged woman who needs to live as  a character in Three's Company to survive. Bonnie is a woman in her early twenties who has only ever had exactly one friend.  Both her parents are dead and you would not call her family one that was memorable in a good way.  She's recently gone through a horrible trauma, coming out of a situation as the only survivor-- if you want to call it survival.<br />Somehow, the old sitcom, Three's Company, comforts her and she becomes obsessed.  When she wins the biggest lottery ever, Bonnie creates an alternate world for herself of the Three's Company set and sets things up so that she will live alone there and be one of the characters from the show each year, moving from apartment to apartment, but always existing in the 1970s.. We already know the concept of this novel going in.  It's in the blurbs. Personally, the best thing about the book, is what I THOUGHT it was going to be. Something light and silly and a little pathetic but in a way that doesn't make you curl up in pain.  Well done. Wish I had not read it.",Positive
"Carolina Moonset is both a fun book to read and a meaningful book about family, aging and illness, Beaufort, Carolina roots, mystery and murder.  Joey Green goes to Beaufort to spend time with his parents who moved to his paternal grandparent's house after years in Chicago.  His father Marshall, who ran a medical clinic in Chicago for indigent people, has Lewey Body Dementia and dealing with its impact on his short term memory and behavior is exhausting to his caretaker wife.  Joey and his sisters are taking turns giving his mother breaks.  Along the way, his fathers strong memory of his youth brings forth stories and implications about people from the community, including the Hammond family.  Now, Tom Hammond has been murdered and Marshall is implicated.  Joey teams up with Leela, daughter of his parents' neighbors, first as a casual date and later as an increasingly intense relationship with potential. The characters, both living and dead are interesting, the plot just twisted enough, with some good red herrings and we care about those involved and want things to be okay for them.",Positive
"This was a charming book about three women, WWII in Britain and true love.  Yes, it is a light read, but well told.  Grace, daughter of the local vicar and childhood friend of Hugh heir to the manor house in their small village, is engaged to marry Lawrence, a vicar with the goal of advancing in the church.  Violet, Hugh's sister, has never thought more about the world, who she is or much of anything but fulfilling her deceased father's expectation she marry a man with a title.  Hugh, since childhood, was destined to marry Astrid, daughter of a wealthy family. Cressida, renowned fashion designer, is an independent single woman, whose great love died in WWI.  She is Hugh and Violet's aunt, but they did not know her because she was estranged from their father.  Got that?  Cressida's home and studio are destroyed in London bombing and she moves to the manor house, needing her relatives to help her.  She meets Grace, who is trying to assess whether there is a way to save her mother's wedding gown.  A local sewing circle, a renowned designer and creative collaboration save the gown and start a fast friendship among the women of the sewing circle and, in particular Grace, Violet and Cressida.  There's plenty of talk of true love with unexpected turns in each woman's life.  Each faces the need to be true to herself and take significant risks.  I am a fan of historical fiction, so the information on strict clothing and material rationing and the extremes the government went to to control even the sale of second hand clothing was fascinating.  My generation certainly heard of the shortage of stockings, the invention of nylon and that women painted stockings on with a line included for a seam. However, this was more a metaphor for much more drastic shortages of all clothing.  Clothing today is often cheap and plentiful with much of it ending up in landfills and rarely recycled.  While this story is about finding a way to make wedding dresses available to women to use in wartime, when purchasing them was impossible due to a lack of required coupons for both new and used clothes, it is really a tale of resourcefulness, finding a path to normalcy in very unusual times and bringing something special to people in wartime.",Positive
"""In the Face of the Sun"" is a portrait of several generations of a Los Angeles family, initially living in a Sears Roebuck home, built from a kit, living a fairly middle class/working class life.  In 1928, Daisy and Henrietta still live at home with their parents, but their mother is seriously ill.  She suffered a heart attack and stroke in the aftermath of a dam collapse that killed her brothers.  Daisy and Henrietta's father is a chauffeur by trade, working for the actor Alfred Lunt at the moment.  Daisy left college when her mother became ill.  She's the older daughter.  Henrietta is around 16.  The ""girls"" are working in the luxurious Sommerville Hotel.  The hotel is just about to celebrate its grand opening as the first high end hotel built and owned by a well off couple and serving a Black clientele. The NAACP is holding its convention at the hotel shortly after it opens with W.E.B. DuBois as the keynote and a host of high profile men and women from the civil rights movement and from the entertainment industry. As hotel staff, Daisy and Henrietta are in their orbit if not at the elevated levels of these powerful guests.<br /><br />There really was a Hotel Sommerville, later the Dunbar Hotel, in L.A..  Bryce does a nice job creating the setting, the city in this time and what was happening in the upper class Black community and with the staff members who served them.  It is the jazz age, and the nightlife and music of this period, still part of the prohibition era, are deftly woven in.  Bryce also does a fabulous job focusing on the Black publications of the era, with a character who is a columnist for the California Eagle.  (An aside:  you can read the California Eagle on Newspapers.com where it is archived. It served as one source for this novel).<br /><br />Although the novel opens and closes in 1990, the story alternates between this era in 1928, when Daisy and Henrietta are on the brink of adulthood, and 1968 when Henrietta's daughter Frankie looks up her Aunt Daisy in Chicago.  They never met and Frankie needs help to leave her abusive husband. Her relationship with her mother is strained at best. Frankie knows Daisy and Henrietta have not talked since 1928, but not why.  Frankie runs hot and cold about her Aunt Daisy, who pursued her interest in writing/journalism over the years and has become a chain smoking character. Daisy agrees to take Frankie to the bus station.  It is that point in 1968 when anti-war sentiment is strong, but Frankie's father died in Korea and she considers service a patriotic duty.  Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed only a few months earlier and Robert F. Kennedy's death is on the horizon.  Aretha is on the radio.  Frankie is starting off on a difficult physical and personal journey.  She's tried to leave her husband before and keeps returning to him. Meanwhile, we learn Daisy is driving to L.A., for unclear reasons.  She drops Frankie off at the bus station, heading off to start her own trip to the same destination. And that's fine with Frankie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the two eras and the ways Bryce brings elements of then current attitudes on race/civil rights, music, class, domestic violence, the Black press and the many lines still firmly drawn between races, classes, men and women.  Yet, in both eras, there are inroads and determined activists as well as folks just living their lives in their Sears homes and their Hollywood mansions. The story did drag a little for me here and there, yet I ended up being happy for every detail included in the whole. I eventually was riveted. ""In the Face of the Sun"" is a lovely, loving piece, well researched, with compelling characters, drama, happiness... life.",Positive
"Casey Larken's father is dead and his half brother Davey inherited dad Joseph's multimillion dollar fortune. Davey was the only ""legitimate"" child. Joseph was a pretty awful guy, as we learn when the book opens with his sparsely attended funeral. Casey- well, he got a house and $50,000 and the house turns out to be occupied by his father's former maid, a Black woman who loved the man - God bless her - and her daughter, Gabrielle, yet another child of Joseph. Gabrielle got nothing, including the college tuition Joseph promised to pay. Davey, now independently wealthy, lives in a town near Asbury Park. His successes in life peaked in high school. Gabrielle's house, now willed to Casey, is on the wrong side of town and she works part time for a weird, racist woman who owns Madame K's, a women's boutique. Casey's childhood home is next door to his best friend Meredith;s house, but his mother took off from Asbury Park long ago leaving him to live with his abusive father and unkind (later divorced) stepmother. NO love lost between these folks and Casey. Thrown into the periphery is a cast of characters who in various ways attract and deflect the attention of the siblings and the community in interconnecting ways. Ultimately, the story touches on organized religion (mostly Syrian Jews in the area and their orthodox practices), general belief or disbelief in God, drug addiction, the dangers of inherited money, idleness, narcissism, either the inability to tell right from wrong or making intentional choices to do something wrong, parent/child relationships in many forms and --maybe-- a study in right and wrong, heaven and hell, God and no God overarching everything.<br /><br />This is a character driven novel and, while it is true, as some reviewers say, that the characters are generally unlikeable, I find I have compassion for even the worst of them and want to understand what makes them tick. Casey is the only one who speaks in first person, but Turtel uses third person narrative for much of the novel. On the whole, this is more a book about being in your twenties in some of the worst possible ways that this transitional period of life can unfold. People get hurt for reasons that don't make sense, have secrets and back stories/experiences we learn about but that don't necessarily explain why they do what they do, They are often just facts we learn that do not really tell us ""why."" Certain moments that describe or involve violence mirror one another, often involving bystanders who don't get involved. And in most cases, they should have. People screw up relationships, half find their way or seem on track to be okay, or wildly fail at life. Little gets resolved in this book, yet I found it engrossing. I was not dissatisfied by the end of the novel as to what happened to each person.<br /><br />I like Turtel's style with shifting storylines that come together and stand alone throughout. I was interested in the motives and actions of every  character, even the bartender.. The ending involves a shift that was unpredictable, yet restores faith in the dignity and depth one of the most likable characters and in the future of at least one sibling who is challenged to do better and to grow up already and get beyond being Joseph's child. Because this is a book about Joseph's children and they are all damaged, yet have the opportunity to overcome him, each for different reasons.. I found this a profound book. It's going to be one I chew over. I went to Asbury Park for a day in the late 1970s and played games at the Palace and looked around, with my boyfriend. This was just before I was aware of Bruce Springsteen who was breaking into the national music scene. We went because my boyfriend grew up near there and thought it was a cool place. We went because it was a beach town and we lived not too far away and we wanted to see the ocean.. And I never forgot that day or that place. It touched me even though it was definitely not in its heyday. It was kind of a ghost place, that had been grander and still survived. Seeing the town as I saw it that spring day out of season in, say 1977 made this novel ring true: . It's definitely a story that rings true, in all its messiness.",Positive
"I always look up more about people who are subjects of historical fiction to get the ""real"" info on someone.  This time, I did it halfway through the book which I chose not to finish because it is way more fiction than historical when it comes to the person it is about. The setting and period information was well researched but the story was embellished to the point that it should not be allowed to stand unchallenged.  Last year, I read ""The Great Mistake"" by Jonathan Lee, an excellent and true to the facts historical fiction piece about Andrew Haswell Green, known as the ""father of New York"" for his incredible accomplishments relating to the creation of Central Park, the NY Public Library, making the five boroughs one city and more. His death was bizarre in that he was shot by a Cornelius Williams, a Black man who mistook him for the very wealthy John Pratt. The Great Mrs. Elias opens with this murder, because the murderer accused Green (who he thought was Pratt) of keeping Bessie Davis from him. Bessie Davis, a Black woman born into poverty in Philadelphia, was now a very wealthy brothel owner with a home on Central Park West. John Pratt was extremely involved with Hannah Elias, loaning her money and giving her money for her businesses and real estate. I assume the book is about to turn to the blackmail case his kids made him bring against Hannah. Just read Newspapers.com about this or Wikipedia. It's way more interesting than this overly long and overly fictionalized version of Hannah Elias's life to the extent I could stand to listen to it.<br /><br />I just turned off the audible version of it. I do not like the narrator, her phrasing or her intonations. I know, because I read a book that stayed true to the Elias/Davis story, that there are SO many liberties taken with her life that it is wrong to call it historical fiction. I want to know that the facts in a historical fiction novel are not so far off that if I say something about an event or person in history, I'm not falsifying things. And this book is WAY too long. The stuff that is accurate is the stuff that sound boring against the author's imaginary relationships and events she used to fill things in. It's all about her learning about how to invest money and accumulate wealth. And sure, a sex worker's life is going to be salacious, but so much is thrown into this book gratuitously, like a love/hate relationship with a famous Black inventor who she probably never met. I can't tell you if I'd have liked this a little better if I hadn't already read an accurate depiction of Hannah Elias in Mr. Lee's book, followed by reading newspaper articles of the day because it was all so interesting. NOTHING could make me listen to this for another seven hours when there are so many good books out there begging to be read. Just. NO! (I'm not angry: You're angry)",Negative
"The Last Grand Duchess is Olga Romanov, eldest daughter of the last Russian Tsar Nicholas and Empress Alexandra.  Like others, I've read at least a few books about the Romanovs, including ""Four Sisters:  The Lost Lives of the Romanov Grand Duchesses"" by Helen Rappaport, that focuses on the daughters including Olga.  This is, of course, a fictionalized version. Turnbull meets my high standards for this genre, having done significant research, making choices when to add a fictional character or change the truth to fit the story without stretching things so far that the ""historical"" part of the fiction is missing.  The story is told on multiple timelines of the few years before Tsar Nicholas's abdication and during the family's period in captivity after his abdication.  I really liked Turnbull's choices as to what to include to give a big picture of what was happening politically and socially in Russia while maintaining focus on Olga.  These included WWI, food riots, Rasputin's hold over the family, Alexie's hemophilia, Empress Alexandra's disabilities and the ways the family were so distant from the people that they didn't see the revolution coming.  During WWI, Olga, her sister Tatiana and Empress Alexandra did hands on nursing. Turnbull does a marvelous job bringing the devastation of war to us while also addressing serious class distinctions that gave officers much better care than the proletariat. In general, this is about a very privileged, unsophisticated, sheltered young woman's coming of age.  It is a well known story and could have been tiresome.  It was instead well organized and well told EXCEPT... I just don't like Turnbull's writing style.  The conversations are often stilted and formal beyond what I'd expect from people just because they are rich or royal.  She uses past perfect and future perfect tense too much..  She throws in unnecessary words that make sentences clumsy.  For example:  ""Though Olga still shuddered when passing the guards in the halls, here in the garden they became less than they purported themselves to be."" Eventually, I gave in to the rhythm of her style and read the whole book and my overall experience was that I appreciated the book overall.  Had the writing been better it would be five stars as a story, in its flow (organization and timing) and for research. Due to my issues with the writing it is four stars.",Positive
"This is a slightly quirky, dysfunctional family, mystery set in 1968 Laguna Beach California.  Matt Anthony is the strangely stable kid with a brother fighting in Vietnam, soon to come home, and an older sister Jazz who is still in high school.  At sixteen, he can drive his Mom's van but usually travels by bike to go fishing and precisely deliver papers for a little much needed cash.  His mother has a big drug problem, barely pays the rent waitressing in a pirate themed restaurant and is tuned out of her children's lives a lot of the time.  His father left long ago and contributes nothing.  He's politically right wing, very into guns and pretends in phone calls to his son that he's there for him, but he never is.  Matt and Jazz both do some work in an early version of a New Age bookstore and gallery.  This is the summer that his long time crush has a crush back at him but another girl, who attends meetings at the retreat occupying acres on a hill also catches his eye.  And along the way, Jazz disappears, the police say she's a runaway, odd factions in town seem to have unexpected connections, his mother moves the family to the part of town that is known for free living and drug use, and Matt's loyalties are all over the place, with one exception:  He knows his sister did not run away.  He knows she is being held somewhere against her will.  And he will do all he can to save her.  This is a cool pastiche of the era, with various points of view represented through  fairly quick sketches but sufficient and engrossing.  Matt is a great character.  Enjoyed.",Positive
"This is a lovely, romantic but also serious historical fiction story about Adele, an orphan who finishes her convent education and moves to Paris where she lands a job as Coco Chanel's assistant.  Their gadabout traveling life has been disrupted by the Nazi occupation of Paris. Chanel closes her fashion house, selling only her fragrances during wartime.  They move into the Ritz, which has been taken over and occupied by Nazi officers.  Cook tells this story from Adele's perspective, as she learns more about what the Nazis stand for, observes people being taken from their homes, never to be seen again, learns bits and pieces about the resistance and a lot about Chanel's political as well as romantic involvement with the Germans.  Along the way, Adele meets and befriends an American doctor, seeks help from him when she takes an impulsive action that could cause her serious trouble, and she must confront her own roles, always on the periphery, in facilitating Chanel's problematic behavior as well as the doctor's dangerous resistance related behavior. The Dressmaker's Secret also is about Chloe, Adele's British granddaughter.  It is 2018 and Chloe, recently divorced after a short lived, loveless marriage, moves to Paris for a year. She helps a friend from university run her boutique, as her friend just had a baby and needs help.  Adele has shared with her grandchildren that she worked for Coco Chanel for five years, but never discussed the experience of living in Paris during the war.  Chloe learns that evidence came out some years ago confirming longstanding rumors about Chanel:  She collaborated with the Nazis.  Was her grandmother complicit?  As she visits places her grandmother lived and worked and researches the files on Chanel, Chloe needs to learn the truth.  Adele is 97 and time is short.  Lorna Cook is a wonderful writer.  She  tells Chanel's story during the period well and consistently with what I already knew about this. Adele, an imagined character is a sympathetic person, an employee, yet in some ways the person who knows more about Chanel than anyone.  Her conflicting feelings about Chanel, about her own privilege in having food and a safe place to stay, about the doctor's extracurricular work and whether she should be doing more are compelling.  A fast and enjoyable read.",Positive
"David Baldacci's Atlee Pine series was engrossing enough that I grabbed each of the books the minute they came out. I don't know if this is the last entry. Atlee Pine is an FBI agent who, throughout this series, is on leave from work to look for her twin sister Mercy. She is joined by her assistant, Carol Blum, an older woman who has worked for the FBI forever and who is a dear friend and mother figure for Atlee.  When the twins were six, a man kidnapped Mercy and attempted to murder Atlee after choosing between them by the old child's rhyme, ""eenie meenie, minie, moe."" As the series develops, it becomes clear that neither sister ""won"" and we follow through the books the devastating impact on Atlee, who uncovers slowly the terrible outcome of this kidnapping for her sister. The characters are interesting and sympathetic and, as to Atlee and some others larger than life. This fourth book in the series was rather violent. introduced some terrific villains as well as people who were passive villains, i.e., who failed to do the ""right"" thing in the face of evil and danger to other people. Atlee and Carol are exposed to serious danger when their search for Mercy puts them in the path of a very disturbed man with both a personal grudge against one dear to them and a grudge against the US government. This story is violent at times, engrossing at times, moving at times and altogether entertaining. I would say that the level of disbelief I had to suspend was rather large for this book as some of the turns it took seemed outlandish, but certainly they were consistent with the outlandish characters and, sadly, with things we all observe in the news.  You just don't WANT to believe in such evil.  Baldacci is consistent in his writing, creative with his plots; is ""fair"" in that he develops the stories with proper clues for us; he provides plenty of support to explain the craziness of some characters and how some can win against great odds; and his depictions of scenes and predicaments are very visual.  I never regret reading a Baldacci thriller.",Positive
"I used to read every Lincoln Rhyme novel and then got out of the habit.  That was a mistake.  ""The Midnight Lock"" is a very satisfactory entry to the series, with a clever, clever villain dubbed, ""The Locksmith,"" whose voyeuristic behavior terrifies women he has watched on the Internet; a blunder on Lincoln's part that gets a mobster off of a murder rap; a parting of ways between Lincoln and the NYPD; a conspiracy theory blogger called Verum; and the tie in of a famous scandal rag to the Locksmith's crimes.  Add in a few particularly dysfunctional families, several fires; a disgraced cop from Albany who is head of security for the scandal rag and there's plenty of fodder for the forensic criminalist and his team.  I'd forgotten what a master Deaver is at putting every clue WE need out there while weaving together multiple subplots through the primary case.  Plus, you learn a lot about locks in the book.",Positive
"This dark comedic mystery was well worth the suspension of disbelief it required a bit too often.  After a car accident in his rental the much misunderstood and notably annoying Denny Braintree finds himself mistaken for a long time resident of a small Vermont town.  This turns out to be convenient for our hero, sort of, when Denny becomes a suspect in a murder without a body and must assume the identity of his doppleganger.  I give  five stars to the character who is both totally off putting and endearing (how did Carkeet DO THAT?) His passion is model trains and when not working on his layout, which he never can do in this novel, or writing about model train layouts for a magazine, he's creating them in his mind, along with the perfect back story for each little figure.  He inevitably is too brash with people, makes puns they don't get and describes himself as intentionally oppositional because it's more exciting.  So if someone is mild-mannered, Denny gets loud and obnoxious with them and vice-versa.  There are many laugh out loud parts.  Most of the other characters are caricatures, but that works.  The plot was okay but as a mystery it was less satisfying than it was as a comedic novel.",Positive
"As a Dan Brown novel, Origin is just okay, certainly no Da Vinci Code.  As one reviewer noted, the novel felt ""unauthentic,""  and for several reasons I agree.  It did not have the same flow as other Dan Brown novels.  And most of the plot elements seem to be pulled directly from the news of the past few years, not particularly original.  But for a novel written mostly by artificial intelligence (AI), if it was, it's not bad as a mass-produced Turing test.",Negative
"I compare this pundit and her followers to what PETA members are to the left: Pure stupidity and mindless forcing of unproved beliefs upon others who have already learned that one can pick and choose their poltical beliefs based on informed decision making.<br /><br />If you like to pidgeonhole yourself as a conservative and need idiotic statistics with little fact behind them to validate your existance, then by all means buy and try to read this book.  This book replaces intelligent rational conservatives with-which one (right or left-minded) can actually discuss things, with idiotic ""dittohead"" morons who spit out the rehashed opinions of such purile pundits.  I call it NASCARification of the right.<br /><br />On the flipside the text is actually small print (unlike Bill O's...which I believe is meant for 5-year-olds.)",Negative

"I was drawn to this book because I hate the common maxim that &#34;Everything happens for a reason.&#34;  I do not believe that God has some grand plan and that suffering and misfortune are part of it.  I was happy to learn from the title that the author agreed that this saying is a &#34;lie&#34; we tell ourselves to get through the misfortunes of life.  It is one thing if these misfortunes are small, but when you are faced with tragedy, or early untimely death, what then?<br /><br />Kate Bowler, the author of this book, was originally an adherent of the &#34;prosperity gospel.&#34;  If you do not know what this is, give thanks, for you have been spared a terrible distortion of the Christian message.  Basically, the prosperity gospel says that God wants all of us to live good, healthy, prosperous lives, and that if you are not, something is wrong with you. It is a mystery to me that anyone believes this, but it has worked well for a number of televangelists, who have made millions duping gullible and unsuspecting people into giving them money and buying their books, tapes, and motivational videos.<br /><br />Kate herself went along with this until she was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer of the colon in her early thirties.  Suddenly, the prosperity gospel made no sense, and she had to rethink her entire approach to God and to religion.  This book is an account of that journey, and it has much to recommend it.  I found the section at the back--things to say, and things to never say to a person whose life has fallen apart for whatever reason, especially compelling.  The book is easy to read and Kate herself is a likable writer with a good sense of humor and irony.  She faces her diagnosis with grace and courage, and the book is not at all dreary or depressing.  Recommended for almost everyone.",Positive
"I was drawn to &#34;Reading with Patrick&#34; because I love books about teaching and the impact teachers can have on students.  Michelle Kuo, a recent graduate of an Ivy League school, is a bit undecided about what to do with her life.  She decides to sign up for Teach for America and is assigned to an impoverished school in Helena, Arkansas.  She is young and idealistic, and at first the students are challenging in a way that she could never have anticipated.  She persists, however, and through herculean effort makes an impression on many of them.<br /><br />Encouraged by her family and friends to go to law school rather than &#34;waste&#34; he talents and her Ivy League education on teaching, she takes the LSAT and is admitted, but then decides to teach for one more year.  She meets Patrick, a promising, intelligent, and sensitive student, and has her greatest success with him.  Later, upon graduating from law school, she gets a letter from Patrick, who is unfortunately awaiting trial for murder.  She returns to Helena, and they begin a close relationship through the seven months he is waiting for trial.  They connect through literature, and Patrick finds a way to express himself through poetry.  Michelle, too, grows through her friendship with Patrick.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parts of this book that dealt with literature and how Michelle was able to relate it to Patrick's life.  Less successful, in my opinion, was the exploration of Michelle's own growth and maturity.  However, I recommend this book for those who like books about personal growth and literature, and how literature can help us see truth and make sense of our world.  The book is easy to read and has many lovely moments that the reader will appreciate.",Positive
"I chose to review &#34;A Boy Made of Blocks&#34; because my cousin and his wife have a little boy who has just been diagnosed with autism.  I have had a little experience with students who have had Asperger's Syndrome, but none with a child as young as my cousin's son (4) or even the title character of this book, Sam (8).  I hoped to find insight into autism, and this book provides a great deal.<br /><br />The book is a novel, but it is grounded in real life.  Like the main character, Alex, the author, Keith Stuart, has a son with autism.  Once the reader knows this, it is hard at first to differentiate between the author and the narrator, since the novel is told in first person.  This becomes a little easier as the book continues, but at first I found myself constantly wondering which events were &#34;true&#34; and which were fiction.<br /><br />As the book opens, Alex, the 30 something-ish main character, has been kicked out of his house by his long-suffering wife, Jody.  Alex is basically a good person, but he is disengaged from life emotionally, especially from his autistic son, Sam, whom he avoids at all cost.  He makes excuses to avoid being alone with Sam or to care for him so as to give Jody a break.  As a result, Alex is living with an old friend, sleeping on an air mattress and feeling sorry for himself.<br /><br />The reasons for Alex's disengagement are slowly revealed, and they revolve around a tragedy from his childhood that continues to affect all the members of his natal family.  Grief and misplaced guilt have kept Alex from investing fully in his marriage and in his role as a father.  I thought that this part of the book could have been handled with more economy; the big reveal is dragged out and not nearly as effective as the other parts.<br /><br />With Jody at the end of her rope, Alex realizes that if he wants to save his marriage, he must start to connect with his son, and his first attempts are halting at best.  Then he discovers Minecraft, the wildly popular video construction/adventure game, and introduces it to Sam.  It turns out that Sam is enraptured by this game and becomes really good at it, and father and son begin to forge their relationship through Minecraft.  This part of the book is excellent.  I had some knowledge of Minecraft through my two nephews, but I found that I understood the game much better after having read this book.  I had thought that the game involved simply building things, but it is far more complex that that.  Both Sam and Alex come to love Minecraft, and the game becomes a portal for Sam to reach out to the wider world.  Alex comes to appreciate Sam's unique outlook on the world and to see him as a person to be loved, not a problem to be solved.<br /><br />My copy of the book was a proof, and it ran close to 400 pages, but do not let the length dissuade you from reading it.  It is a very fast read, and my guess is that some people would finish it in a single day.  I  recommend this book to readers who would like more insight into children with autism and the immense challenges their families face day after day.  It is no surprise to me that many marriages cannot withstand the pressures, which are superbly described in this book.  The writing is good but not great, and the pacing is mostly good, but uneven.  Since the setting is England, there are some word choices that will be unfamiliar to American readers, but most of these are easily understood in context.  The book I read is an uncorrected proof, and I hope the editors correct the many pronoun errors I found throughout, such as &#34;between Jody and I&#34; or &#34;She was waiting for Sam and I,&#34; or (my personal favorite), &#34;Her and Dan went clubbing last night.&#34;<br /><br />Finally, I fear that I have made this book sound grim and tragic.  It is not.  It is warm and even at times very funny.  Alex has a great sense of humor, and some of his observations made me laugh out loud.  Every main character is sympathetic and easy to relate to.  It is not hard to imagine that someone will make a film of this novel one day.  If there were a way to give this book 4.5 stars, I would.  Highly recommended.",Positive
"I was drawn to read this book by the promise that it was similar to Celeste Ng's &#34;Everything I Never Told You&#34; and Curtis Sittenfeld's &#34;Prep,&#34; both of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Unfortunately, this book has almost nothing in common with them except that they are both about high school students.<br /><br />In fact, in was difficult for me to continue reading beyond the first chapter, in which the reader is introduced to the most thoroughly unappealing, unlikable, repellent, vicious, and obnoxious group of middle school students imaginable.  I have taught middle school, and though this is a very challenging group of kids to teach, they have charm, honesty, and an engaging attitude that is totally missing from these kids.<br /><br />After we are forced to spend time with these characters in Chapter 1, the next chapter flashes forward to high school, where each character is given a chapter detailing his or her life and the consequences of an event that occurred in middle school.  Uniting all these chapters is a young English teacher whose naivete is breathtaking, even for a 23-year-old.  Top all of this off with parents who are mostly absent and a creepy sexual predator/teacher across the hall, and what do you have?  A hot mess, that's what.<br /><br />I really cannot recommend this book for anyone.  It was  total disappointment, and in my opinion Ng and Sittenfeld are owed an apology for their fine works being mentioned in the same breath with this book.",Negative
"Like several other Vine reviewers, I am finding it somewhat difficult to review &#34;Anna and the Swallow Man.&#34;  Set in Poland in 1939 and the few years following, the story follows 7-year-old Anna, whose father, a professor of linguistics, is taken captive by the Nazis and eventually killed.  We learn all of this in the first two pages of the book, but of course Anna knows nothing of this.  She knows only that her father left her in the care of someone who, when he figures out her father's likely fate, refuses to take her into his own home.  Left on her own, Anna is taken under the wing of a strange and mysterious person she calls the Swallow Man.  Together they travel throughout Poland for at least three years, trying to avoid both the Bears (the Russians) and the Wolves (the Germans).<br /><br />In some ways this is a classic hero's journey story:  the hero (Anna) leaves everything she knows and holds dear to discover something of value that will enrich either herself or her community.  Along the way, the hero is accompanied by helpers (the Swallow Man, Reb Hirschel) and must endure tests and trials.  Often there are tempters, those who try to divert the hero from his or her journey (the Peddler, the pharmacist), but with the assistance of the helper(s) the hero prevails.  This book does not follow this motif exactly--for one thing, the main helper, the Swallow Man, is very complex and mysterious, and the ending is enigmatic.  However, much of the story reflects the Hero's Journey.<br /><br />This book's language is absolutely wonderful.  Powerfully metaphorical and poetic, it made me question why this book is being marketed as a children's book.  Although the main character is a child, much of the action as well as the language is well beyond a child's comprehension; it occurred to me that perhaps the book could be profitably read by older students with the help of a teacher and class discussion of various parts.  It is a lovely and mysterious story, but in my opinion it is anything but a children's story.  It has been compared with Anne Frank, a book frequently taught in 8th or 9th grade, but it is far more challenging in tone, language, and subject matter.  When I was reading it, I was reminded of &#34;The Road,&#34; which was set in the aftermath of a war and likewise involved a journey, and is very much an adult book.  I am eager to hear what other reviewers have to say about this, and I would also love to hear from some young adult readers.  My guess is that they will not &#34;get&#34; the book without a little adult input.<br /><br />I did like this book very much.  I recommend it for adult readers and very mature adolescents.",Positive
"&#34;All Dogs Go to Kevin,&#34; a clear reference to &#34;All Dogs Go to Heaven,&#34; is a delightful book that will be loved and appreciated by anyone who loves dogs and has ever had a dog share his or her life.  Jessica Vogelsang, the author, details her own coming of age and her relationships with the three dogs she has owned:  Taffy, Emmett, and Kekoa.  She begins the journey in middle school and takes us on an emotional journey through high school, college, veterinary school, and marriage.<br /><br />The book is engaging and very easy to read; even kids in upper elementary grades would be able to manage it.  However, the part I found most compelling was the role that dogs play in the lives of, as the author puts it in her dedication, &#34;the misfits, the miscreants, the misunderstood, the freaks and geeks and socially inept, and the dogs who love them.&#34;  It is clear from the outset that the author sees herself as one of these &#34;misfits&#34; who found salvation in the love of a dog.  She write with grace and compassion of her relationship with both animals and people, and she clearly does not write off anyone, no matter what issues they may have.<br /><br />Some reviewers have compared the book favorably to James Herriot's &#34;All Creatures Great and Small.&#34;  I do not share this view.  I found Herriot's books far more charming and compelling and have read each one several times.  This book is just not in that category.  However, that is not meant to dismiss the many virtues of this book.  Almost any lover of dogs would enjoy and identify with the characters in the book, especially the author.  I recommend it highly, and if you are not expecting Herriot, you will enjoy this book exactly for what it is.",Positive
"I really enjoyed Laura McBride's ""We Are Called to Rise.""  Set in Las Vegas, this novel uses four interrelated narrators to tell an unforgettable story.  Avis, the first narrator, is a 53-year-old woman who is suddenly left by her husband.  As her story unfolds, we see her love for her child has blinded her to reality.  The second narrator is Bashkim, an 8-year-old Albanian boy living with his parents and baby sister in Las Vegas.  His story reflects the struggle of immigrants to integrate into American society and to comprehend its culture.  The third narrator, Luis, is a soldier recovering from severe PTSD and an attempted suicide at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington DC.  He witnessed the horrors of the war in Iraq, and has both physical and psychological trauma to deal with.  Finally, the fourth narrator, Roberta, is a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) volunteer.  Her place in the story will give away too much of the plot, so I will say little about her.<br /><br />The lives of all these characters begin separately but eventually intertwine.  I loved the writing, especially in the first half of the book.  The characters seemed realistic, and their situations uniformly heartbreaking.  Toward the end, I felt that the author lost the voice of Bashkim, as he began to think and say things that seemed well beyond an 8-year-old.  However, this did not spoil the book for me, and I think readers will come to love Bashkim perhaps more than any other character.<br /><br />This book will appeal to anyone who wants to read a thoughtful reflection on many of the issues we currently confront in America.  Among them are domestic violence, grief, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their devastating effects on the men and women who fought them, our immigration system and its failures, and the lack of connection we have in our communities.  I really liked this book, and it deserves 4.5 stars.  Highly recommended.",Positive
"As a fan of the ABC Family show &#34;The Fosters,&#34; which is about a family made up primarily of foster children and which deals sensitively and realistically with some of the issues they face, I was eager to read this book.  &#34;Returnable Girl&#34; is narrated by Ronnie (Veronica), a teenager who has lived in nine foster homes in five years, always being &#34;returned&#34; to the foster care system for one reason or another.  As the book opens, she is finally in a stable and loving place, but that does not mean her problems are over--far from it.<br /><br />The book is written in the form of journal entries.  As Ronnie navigates her new home, school, friends, church, and so on, we see both her issues as a teen and her complicating issues as a foster child.  We learn of her past--absent dad, utterly irresponsible mom, cold and unfeeling relatives--and we travel with her the ups and downs of modern teen culture.  Ronnie has had a hard life, and she is not the easiest person to deal with.  She is not above cruelty herself, especially with respect to her unfortunate friend Cat.  Her past has left its scars, yet Ronnie is an appealing character, and I think the teenage girl audience for whom this book is aimed will love it.<br /><br />My only issue with the book is the voice of the teens themselves.  It seems not quite right to me.  It seems more like the way the kids on &#34;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&#34; talked.  It just misses being authentic.  Perhaps I am too critical, but I just read Chris Bohjalian's &#34;Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands,&#34; and the voice of that teenage narrator is utterly right.  But maybe this is something only an adult would notice.<br /><br />In any event, &#34;Returnable Girl&#34; would have been a five-star book but for the issue of voice.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in foster children and the problems they face, often from the very agencies that are trying to help them.",Positive
"""Blue Plate Special,"" a memoir by writer Kate Christensen, begins when she is about two years old with a memory that will haunt her for the rest of her life.  If anyone doubts the tremendous influence of parents on their children, both for good and ill, you have only to read this searing and effective memoir.  At two, Kate sees her adored but remote father beat her overwhelmed mother at the breakfast table and then leave for work as if it were an ordinary day.  This event, and others like it, forever affects the way Kate responds to men and influences nearly every choice of man that she makes throughout her life.  Choosing unsuitable men is one major motif of this book, and the reader suffers along with Kate as she struggles with each one.  Not until she is in her forties does she resolve parental issues and make a superb choice in a partner.<br /><br />This book is very well written, and, as the summary notes, each event in Kate's life is described at least partly in terms of food or the absence of food.  For me, this was some of her best writing.  No matter what she is describing, whether it is a simple soft cooked egg or a more complex chicken tagine, she makes the food sound great.  Her writing here reminded me of Ernest Hemingway (though I suspect she would abhor this comparison)--but Hemingway could describe food so that you wanted to go fishing, catch a trout, and cook it over an open fire on the side of the stream.  These food descriptions are like that, and Christensen includes one or two recipes at the end of every section of the book.<br /><br />Kate's mother eventually leaves her father, taking Kate and her two younger sisters with her.  Though this is Kate's story. I felt great empathy for her creative but depressive mother, who truly gave each of her children as many opportunities as she could with her limited means.  Each of her three daughters is affected by parental dysfunction, and each responds differently.  For many years, Kate identifies with her ""strong"" father, choosing men essentially like him, and blaming her mother for her weakness.  Each daughter is estranged from the mother at some point, and I was frustrated with all of them for the judgment they brought to their mother, who definitely had her limitations but who was creative and artistic and encouraged artistic expression in each of her daughters.  Especially annoying (but utterly believable) was how quickly each daughter would respond to very infrequent contact from their father, as if he were a great dad rather than a deadbeat loser.<br /><br />Another aspect I liked was the unstinting honesty with which Kate recounts each event in her life.  She does not make excuses for her behavior, and this is a rarity in memoir.  With the help of therapy, she has excellent psychological insight into her own choices.  In my opinion, quite a number of her problems would have been mitigated if she had consumed less alcohol, but that is not a choice she made.  The reader suffers with Kate through each failed romance, rejected manuscript, and  hung-over morning after.<br /><br />I definitely recommend ""Blue Plate Special"" for anyone who enjoys good writing and in interested in the formation of a writer.  Though I have not read any of the author's other books, I was interested in how she took incidents from her life and reworked them in her fiction.  I hope to read more of Kate Christensen's work, and I wish her well.",Positive
"""Stranger in the Room"" is the second in a mystery series by Amanda Kyle Williams.  I would have enjoyed this novel much more if I had read the first, as I am sure it gives much-needed background information.  There are numerous characters to follow, and the story lines gan get confusing.<br /><br />The setting of this book is Atlanta, Georgia.  Keye Street is a Chinese orphan who was adopted by an American couple and who grew up to become a profiler for the FBI.  She has a mentally ill cousin, Miki, whom she wants to protect, but Miki is highly unreliable, always in trouble or about to be victimized.  Keye has problems of her own:  she is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for four years but  has neglected attending her meetings, and the stress she is enduring make her more vulnerable to a relapse with every chapter.<br /><br />Keye's work as a profiler makes her a natural help for her boyfriend, who is on the Atlanta Police Force.  She also has a detective agency that she runs with her friend, Neil.  All of these story lines come together as numerous people are murdered along the way, and we are led into a story of sexual obsession and anger.  A bizarre and disturbing subplot deals with a mother and son team who are supposed to be  cremating bodies but who instead throw them away.<br /><br />I would like to read the previous book in this series.  This one is well written, but it moves a bit slowly until about two-thirds of the way through.",Positive
"""The Mirrored World"" by Debra Dean is a good introduction to the culture of upper class and royal life in the Russia of the 1700s.  Born into a minor titled family, Xenia is only about six when we first meet her.  She lives a conventional upper class life, doing essentially what is expected of her throughout her adolescence and in the early days of her marriage.  Unlike many women of her time, she marries for love, and she is blissfully happy at first.  The first half of the book covers this part of her life.<br /><br />Xenia's happiness does not last long; two unexpected tragedies occur, throwing her first into deep mourning and then into a complete breakdown.  The second half of the book traces Xenia's transformation into a ""holy fool"" or a ""fool for Christ.""  She sees the emptiness and transitory nature of earthly possessions and joys and relationships, and dedicates herself to service of the poorest of the poor.  While many saintly men and women have had just that sort of insight and made exactly that same service to the poor their life's work, Xenia goes to an extreme, to put it mildly.  We see Xenia's family try to help her, to no avail.<br /><br />As I read this book, I could not help but think that one age's sanctity is another age's madness.  To me, Xenia seems truly to have lost contact with reality.  A religious person may say that she simply made contact with a greater reality, but I am not so sure.  I feel certain that if a person acted this way today, he or she would surely be institutionalized or at least treated with medication.<br /><br />Xenia is a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church, and the book purports to show her path to sainthood.  It does this in lovely and often poetic language.  The descriptions of the Russian landscape and way of life among the upper classes were excellent, and I kept reading the book largely for the superb use of language.  But I doubt that Xenia is a saint for our times.  For that, check out Dorothy Day or Maximilian Kolbe.",Positive
"I selected ""Cloudland"" by Joseph Olshan to review because I enjoyed ""Clara's Heart,"" one of his previous books.  I looked forward to a coherent and literate mystery.  Unfortunately, ""Cloudland"" is neither.<br /><br />At the center of this book is a college writing teacher, Catherine Winslow, who has been fired from her job for an affair with a graduate student.  Catherine is a fan of Wilkie Collins, a writer best known for ""The Moonstone,"" whose final unfinished work, ""The Widower's Branch,""  is rare and obscure.  In fact, Catherine has one copy;  only four copies exist in libraries in the United States.  This unfinished work describes a series of murders.<br /><br />Catherine becomes involved when several women are strangled in her small Vermont town.  Because some of the details of the murders mirror those in ""The Widower's Branch,""  suspicion begins to fall on persons who knew the book or who had access to it.  Catherine is not suspected in the crimes, but she is asked to help evaluate the evidence because of her specialized knowledge.<br /><br />The actions of several characters are inexplicable.  Why does Catherine continue to see her much-younger lover, despite a truly frightening event that is told in flashback?  How is it that a police detective is familiar enough with obscure works of literature to frame a series of people for the crime?  At every turn, characters act in bizarre and irrational ways.<br /><br />The end of the novel is especially strange.  Catherine links the death of one of the victims to her own difficulty believing in love.  Yes, that's right--it is all about her.  I found this ending clunky, egocentric, and unsatisfying.  I must say, however, that I was grateful that the book finally came to an end.<br /><br />I hope that anyone thinking about purchasing this book will read the review of another Vine member, Robin Wolfson.  She has written an incisive, humorous, and compelling review of this mostly incomprehensible book.  Do yourself a favor and read before you buy.",Negative
"When I ordered this book to review, I was not aware that it was the latest in a series of books, the Lake Loon Mystery series, all mysteries dealing with the residents of Lake Loon, a small town in Wisconsin.  Perhaps if I had read the previous books and  come to know the characters and environs better, my opinion of this book would be different.  However, to a reader just picking up the book and expecting a good mystery, ""Dead Tease"" is a great disappointment.<br /><br />First of all, the characters in this book are a mish-mash of strange and weird personalities:  a crazy doctor, her evil mother, the odd police chief, her sometimes lover, an unbalanced wife, and at the center of it all, the main character--is it Jim or John?--a philandering Don Juan who is the CEO of a small clinic at Lake Loon.  To have a good reading experience, the reader has to care about at least some of the characters, but these were too strange to elicit empathy.<br /><br />Second, the plot is weak.  The ""dead tease"" could be any one of them, not that the reader cares much who it is by the end of the book.  A reader should be able to look back after the mystery is revealed and see how it unfolded, but this reveal is just confusing.<br /><br />Finally, the number of grammatical errors in this book was distracting.  I realize that the advance copies we get in the Vine Program are uncorrected proofs, and I expect to see some errors, but I have never seen so much that needs to be corrected--spelling, punctuation, usage, even names of characters.  When a previously unmentioned name was introduced, I hunted through the book for who he was--to no avail.  The book does not have to be grammatically perfect, but it should be able to be read without annoyance.<br /><br />The only virtue of this book is its brevity.  At 170 pages or so, at first I thought I had inadvertently ordered a children's book.  The subject matter, however, is definitely adult.  To repeat, maybe if you are a fan of this series, you will enjoy this book.  But I strongly caution anyone who just picks up this book in search of a good, well-plotted mystery:  You may be disappointed.",Negative
"""The Professionals"" by Owen Laukkanan will appeal to many who enjoy the suspense and crime genres.  The novel is almost exclusively plot-driven, with little or no atmosphere, characterization, or psychological insight.  However, plot drives many novels of this kind, and they are wildly popular.  I predict that this novel will find a wide audience, too.<br /><br />The story begins as four college friends, unable to find well-paying jobs, turn to low-payout, high volume kidnappings of wealthy businessmen.  The kidnappings are solely about money; no violence is ever involved.  For two years, they move from ""job"" to ""job' until one day they kidnap a repellent man with mob connections through his wife.  For the first time, their carefully planned routine goes awry.  At the same time, the law, represented by State Investigator Kirk Stevens and FBI Agent Carla Windermere, is taking an interest in this kidnapping and others that are at first seemingly unrelated.  The bulk of the book concerns the efforts of the four young people to evade both the law and the mob.<br /><br />This novel is easy to read and moves along quickly.  At 370 pages, it has 93 chapters, many only two or three pages long.  I would classify this book as escapist reading.  There are many implausible situations that will leave readers wondering how this or anything even remotely like it could have happened in the real world.  The book will not satisfy fans of authors like P. D. James, but James Patterson fans will be happy for another writer to fill their bookshelves.  The author's note suggests that the he plans more books featuring Stevens and Windermere, so perhaps their characters will be more developed in later books.  They are likable people--maybe a made-for-TV movie is in the offing?",Positive
"I selected ""Light from a Distant Star"" because I had previously read some of the author's work and enjoyed it, especially ""Songs in Ordinary Time.""  Mary McGarry Morris's latest effort is not quite up to ""Songs,"" but it is worth  a read nonetheless.<br /><br />""Light"" is a coming of age story that will appeal to both adults and adolescents, though I suspect some of the nuances of the book will be lost on teens.  The central character, 13-year-old Nellie Peck, is beautifully drawn, with all the innocence and confusion of her age.  She prides herself on having what Holden Caulfield called ""an excellent BS detector,"" and she struggles to remain true to herself, even when family, peer, and other pressures mount.<br /><br />Each character in the book is  facing some sort of crisis.  The parents are facing imminent financial collapse, and each deals with it in diametrically opposite ways; the older sister is trying to re-connect with her birth father; the younger brother is trying to overcome shyness and insecurity.  A wider circle of friends, relatives, and neighbors each has his or her own eccentricities.  In the midst of all this, a murder occurs, and Nellie finds herself the star witness.  Ultimately she has to decide not just whether or not to do the right thing, but what the right thing is in the first place.<br /><br />This novel has been compared with Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" but I think the comparison is not merited.  Whatever the chaos in Lee's book, it had a moral center, Atticus Finch, that was solid and true, around which the entire narrative circled.  There is no real moral center in Morris's book, which makes the confusion of the central character very understandable.  This is not to say that none of the adult characters are good, but rather that they are compromised by financial need and societal pressures.  In this respect the title tells the reader a great deal:  The starlight we see comes from a star that no longer exists.  Is the author suggesting that modern life has no moral absolutes?  Are we left with only the residual light of a moral universe long past?<br /><br />In any event, I do recommend this book.  It held my interest, with realistic and well-drawn characters and a well-paced story line.  Readers will appreciate that Morris rejects easy and simplistic solutions to complex problems.",Positive
"Why would anyone take the opinions or ""facts"" of a self-confessed sexual predator seriously? Mr. Kratz is on a mission to...what exactly? The book is about himself. Not Steven Avery, and not Teresa Halbach. Not sure what he's trying to accomplish here. He's hostile and abrasive. Also, A PREDATOR. How is this man not in jail?",Negative

Cute Christmas book. Took off a star because I think for a board book I would have preferred more basic words and the action and emotion words seem confusing to me. But overall it is a very nice holiday book with lots to look at and nice illustrations.,Positive
"A cute little book about Hillary Clinton. Unlike other reviewers, I actually like the title. There isn't much about her playing hockey, but I think the point was to create interest with kids, which it did, and inside they will find other little stories and facts that are relatable, relevant and interesting. I learned a few things and my kids enjoyed it as well. The only reason I took off a star is because the story jumps around a bit and some parts don't flow because kids might not understand the bracketed words to clarify quotes. But other than that I like this kid-friendly biography and the messages it sends.",Positive
"An accountant’s delight, otherwise OK. Not being an accountant, but being an investor, I think the book provides a good checklist of general  things to look for in order for an investor to be cautious, before buying or keeping a stock. For instance, as the book warns, be wary when a founder of a company controls most of the voting shares of stock and the public mostly gets another class of the stock, with less or no voting power.",Positive
"What first attracted me to this book by Gregg Easterbrook, is the testimonial by Walter Isaacson, since I respect his journalism.<br /><br />The book is a persuasive look at how, despite the dystopian look at America as presented by the 2016 campaign of the new president, things are actually not just pretty good, but are quite an advancement from the past for most, as the author states the arrow of history always points up. And as with all societal advancements, come disruptions to many who either can’t or won’t adapt to the changes, and government is slow to provide help to those disadvantaged by the progress.<br /><br />Though the progress might be hard to see by many in the US or Europe, the middle class is shrinking because most leaving are moving up, and since 1990, extreme world poverty has declined from 37% to 10%.. Sure, reform is needed along with the changes, and the author addresses the possible reforms needed while also pointing out how the disadvantaged can currently adapt. The author goes into tackling the following.<br /><br />Are we starving? No, high yield farming has not only solved that, but the world’s population growth rate peaked around 1960, dropping from about 2.3% to 1.4% per year now. Yet popular films like The Hunger Games portray a future of starvation.<br /><br />Why, despite all our bad habits, are we living longer? Better healthcare, better disability handling like telecommuting, plus there is a strong correlation between better education and longer life expectancy.<br /><br />Will nature collapse? Mt. St. Helens’ 1980 eruption was equal to about the power of 1,500 Hiroshima nuclear bomb explosions. Some predicted that needed farmland would destroy our forests, yet since 1980 our forest cover has increased about 15%. Plus, replacements for CFC refrigerants have improved the atmosphere, as have smog controls. 3D seismology, fracking and better car efficiency standards have erased dire warnings of peak oil,<br /><br />Will the economy collapse? No, basically market economics, with its distributed  decision making, eliminated the situation of one leader causing a collapse. There never was a time when all jobs were secure, but there never were more US manufacturing jobs than in 2017. Despite claims that our workforce participation is down, it is about 63% compared to the low of 60% in 1966. Plus, those who complain that GDP growth is slowing, ignore that measurements of GDP are less accurate, like surgeries produce better results. The author does suggest GDP growth could improve with less regulation and public financing of political campaigns. Government efficiency and less debt can be achieved by replacing many social programs with a universal basic income or expanded earned income tax credits. And since a person’s intelligence is pretty much developed by age 6, extending paid work leave to parents of young children would improve population achievements.<br /><br />Why is violence in decline? Murder and war deaths per capita don’t even appear in the top ten causes of death. The greatest deterrent to crime is the more likely chance of being caught, thus just the cellphone has reduced crime. Less colonialism, more treaties and trade have reduced war. And as devices improve, so does morality.<br /><br />Why does technology become safer instead of more dangerous? Cars, ships, locomotives, etc become not only safer, but cleaner. Smaller and more accurate weapons reduce war deaths.<br /><br />Why don’t dictators win? Liberated people are more ingenious, democracies spread.<br /><br />How declinism has become chic. Research centers, government agencies and political interest groups seek funding. The media looks to grab attention with negative events, often overusing the term, crisis. As demographics age, there is the human tendency to glamorize youthful times. Human bodies are good at producing adrenaline and cortisol, thus a human tendency towards anxiety over future uncertainty, recently in the US and Europe when the white majority feels threatened by immigration. New, social media leads to more opinionization, clustering of ideas called the Big Sort, people only having relationships with people who think similarly, thus more susceptible to the Big Lie.<br /><br />The “impossible” challenge of climate change. Basically, see the above for clues to the future.......the Big Lie works, but there is reason for hope since not everyone believes the Big Lie.<br /><br />The “impossible” challenge of inequality. Progress does breed income inequality. Moving helps, like rust belt Midwest victims moving south and to the coasts. Again, a universal basic income might help.<br /><br />We’ll never run out of challenges. The author mentions future challenges like more robots, artificial intelligence and quantum computing<br /><br />I do recommend the book.",Positive
"Unfortunately I only received the flash cards for this set to review. From what I can tell from the flash cards it looks like a great program. My 5 year old granddaughter is finally getting the hang of reading so I was really looking forward to testing out this method with her to get her more comfortable. Without any instructions we just started doing the flashcards, one group at a time and I was surprised by how eager she was to keep doing more. We could have probably gone through the whole box in one sitting. My 8 year old grandson also enjoyed doing the flashcards and was stumped by a few of the longer more difficult words. I wish I knew how the flashcards fit into the program and how to use them properly.",Positive
"The book, by Jonathan Tepperman, excellently looks into the world situation, as many describe as hopeless, but sees many examples of extraordinary success in tackling big problems and presents them as ways which might also be used elsewhere. The common denominator of the successes is using pragmatism, not looking for perfection, but moving positively.<br /><br />First, he sees the Terrible Ten problems being income inequality, immigration, corruption, Islamic extremism, civil war, the resource curse, energy, the middle income trap, gridlock I, and gridlock II.<br /><br />As for possible improvements, I will cover these.....<br /><br />Brazil's poverty.<br /><br />Rather than lots of social programs, Lula introduced Bolsa Familia, just giving poor families cash  with certain rules, like having the kids attend school so that future generations will have greater chances for success in addition to making the parents better consumers. And being cheaper for the government. Basically combining left wing goals with right wing, Milton Friedman  economics......pragmatism.<br /><br /> Canada's need for more people, but white resistance, even from existing minorities.<br /><br />So, rather than an incremental approach to immigration, mass immigration with strict vetting for those most likely to help the economy, resulting in a true multicultural nation. And with strong government support for multiculturalism, it made the nation more Canadian, not less.<br /><br />Mexican gridlock.<br /><br />Since the winning party had no majority, it created a plan to have all three major parties participate.<br /><br />America's shale revolution<br /><br />It really could only happen in the US because of such things like its bankruptcy laws which encourage risk taking, RE laws which sometimes allow residential land owners also mineral rights thus encouraging investment returns for average people, Wall Street lending/investment, environmental costs effectively managed, lesser population density than Europe, etc.<br /><br />Other topics include Rwanda's overcoming its genocidal past, Indonesia overcoming terrorism, Singapore overcoming corruption and lack of natural resources and Botswana overcoming conflicts over new diamond riches.<br /><br />Sure, it takes special situations, like good leaders or just good luck, but all counties or governments could gain insights from the book, hence I recommend it.",Positive
"Our kindergartner is studying different habitats right now, and will be taking a field trip to the Birch Aquarium in a couple weeks, so I thought this would be a great book for him. Both him and his 3 yr old sister enjoyed this book being read to them.

For my 3 year old I just read the story, but my 6 year old also likes to be read the detailed excerpts.",Positive
"The author, of Greek heritage, goes to Greece to better understand how the nation will cope with the effects of the 2008 financial crash on it and its membership in the EU.<br /><br />He sees modern Greece as corrupt, with its government, via kickbacks, bribes, etc, providing easy living for all government workers and their descendants. Greeks don't see this as bad, just making up for brutal treatment under the Ottoman Empire. Plus, taxes go underpaid.<br /><br />Kind of a paradox, a nation as a birthplace of democracy, science and reason, now a dysfunctional government and people who expect to be rewarded.<br /><br />Meanwhile, those with ties to the government do pretty well, while those tied to the private economy either do well and move money out of Greece, or suffer.<br /><br />Greece probably cooked the books to get accepted  to the EU and cannot meet reforms because the nation lives on corruption.<br /><br />Also, past NAZI occupation of Greece during WW2 still evokes passion, such they see Germany as just the latest evil incarnation of the past, via the austerity wanted in proposed reforms. Talk of WW2 reparations still are prevalent.<br /><br />The author uses lots of interviews to paint his picture of recent Greece and I recommend the book to better understand Greece in relation to the current financial situation.",Positive
"This book makes a pretty good case for the challenges Europe faces in the coming years as it recovers from the 2008 financial crash and tackles with what the EU is and can be, and the future of the Euro.<br />The author maintains that great creativity must be used as the recovery is slow and it can't just rely on some normal course of events to handle the job.<br /><br />He actually wants Europe to look to the US for direction, as our economy is currently the best in the world and we've confronted immigration and done pretty well, for example.<br />Some points from the book....<br /><br />1. Europe is no longer mighty, but still must face some internal differences. Most countries have mounted up enormous debt and the Welfare state approach which has existed for years,can't stay that way because governments can't afford to do so without major changes, like with pensions, using a more defined contribution approach as the US does. The author describes such an eventuality as a social investment state - embrace opportunity and risk - flexsecurity.<br /><br />2. The three main EU institutions are the Commission, Council and Parliament. EU1 has evolved into EU2, where rule, so to speak, is decided, but that's the problem - no voting by all EU people, just basically out of sight with basically France and Germany's leaders making the decisions.<br /><br />3 Climate change is big, but the EU is mixed up. It should evolve into renewable energy like getting off coal first since that is the worst pollutant, so even advance more into fracking as the US is doing, since natural gas can replace coal. The author sees coal as worse than nuclear.<br /><br />4. The IMF has turned into a big player, also the ECB. But, unlike the US, there is no EU bond like US Treasuries.<br /><br />5. The author thinks an economic federalism has to occur, call it EU3. Each state must have some voice. It could take up to ten years.<br /><br />6. English should be made the official EU language, with everyone speaking/writing both English and their native country's language.<br /><br />7. The author talks about a representative democracy, but with more visibility, a monitory democracy, maybe incorporating advances in social media....a global village. Embrace a re-industrialization like the US - 3D printing, etc.<br /><br />8. Austerity is bad, but still reform is necessary in most states.<br /><br />9. Smart growth needed - reform education, innovation, R&D, information and communication technologies.<br /><br />10. Take action on tax havens and tax avoidance. Income inequality is a problem.<br /><br />11. Interculturism must replace multiculturalism in a globalized world - accepting people as different, not expecting assimilation.<br /><br />12. The author, basically agreeing that China is more democratic than the US. The US being a showbiz democracy, more about showmanship than leadership, while China has deep discussions before agreeing on a 5 year plan.<br /><br />13. The EU tried to be in the forefront on climate change, wanting to establish a carbon tax and have a trading system, but it ran into all kinds of problems, with any reduction of emissions mostly due to the recession. CA has had more success with such a trading system. Obama met with major nations and at least came up with in informal agreement, where the dysfunctional EU was essentially left out. So, basically the world has done nothing to reduce emissions, while also we have entered an anthropocene age, where humans have influenced nature everywhere. Conservation is no longer relevant, must use artificial means like biotechnology to recreate what has been lost. Again, the EU is especially dependent on more creatively doing things, rather than looking to the past.<br /><br />14. As for energy, the EU is messed up. Coal is the worst, and reducing nuclear energy just means greater use of coal, plus natural gas is best until renewables dominate, but EU lags the US in fracking knowledge.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is very good in showing how Europe is facing a critical time where it faces many challenges while not very united as needed, so must embark on more creativity to solve the problems, hence even more important to look to the US, which does lead in creativity even with its dysfunctional government.",Positive
"My 4yr old grandson liked this book. Original story with nice illustrations. He hasnt asked me to read it again, though, so might not be for every kid.",Positive
"I don't know about the claim that the book is darkly comedic, except only in a very dark way, but I can see how it could be adapted for the screen in such a way, especially since the story does lend itself to movie adaption. The story, a crime thriller, goes on a path which incorporates much music, a tracing of the blues, which fits the story as itself is kind of a metaphor for a blues song. That said, I really like the book. It combines suspense and an interesting assortment of characters, though I would prefer it not have the gory bits of violence it contains, even though I do see how it does fit the story.",Positive
"This book is a response the the Occupy Wall Street and other Occupy movements around the world, where the protestors know there is something wrong, the 1% vs the 99%, most people on the planet, but so far haven't come up with any comprehensive descriptions of the problems or possible solutions, because it is so complex. The author lays most of the blame on neo-liberal economics and related politics, beginning around 1980 with US president Reagan and Britian's Margaret Thatcher - basically complete free-trade and free movement of money with negligible government regulation, resulting in a transference of wealth from public hands and the poor and middle class, into the hands of the wealthy and well-connected. This all represented, in the US, along with, to a degree, Britain, which he calls ""The Empire,"" where what has resulted in a corporatocracy, a form of fascism, where the political system is bought and paid for by large corporations where this capitalism seeks cheap labor and resources from around the world, all the while using up the planet's resources to the point where we are nearing a point of no return where the survival of the world's civilization is at stake unless we change this direction.<br /><br />What the author claims is that we are going through a paradigm shift from Cartesian/Newtonian physics to Quantum physics at the world level, where the world is a living organism where it isn't ""cause and effect"" at the world view level,  but everything is connected. He offers a possible solution, a Gaian society, led by some small nations and leaders including some wise elders from around the world, to work together with new organizations and local currencies replacing the WTO, IMF and World Bank to work toward a sustainable planet which will change the way we live from from one of greed and accumulating money and material things to one where there is more meaning to our lives.<br /><br />The book is divided into 6 parts - Planet under siege, Drivers of Destruction, The Empire, New values/New beliefs, Toward a Gaian World Order, Getting There.<br /><br />Among the things covered are...<br /><br />1. Global warming (carbon footprint), extinction of species, genetic engineering a risk, antibiotic resistant bacteria, monoculture (industrial farming reduces crop rotation, etc).<br /><br />2. Corporatocracy is a threat to our civilization because it is overloading our ecosystem as exhibited above, plus overpopulation.<br /><br />3. Peak oil is mere decades away - tar sand oil and natural gas via fracking  use more energy to produce, especially when clean-up costs are included.<br /><br />4. Tainter's Theory - civilizations solve problems using greater complexity until they become so complex the are overwhelmed by it and collapse.<br /><br />5. Currently, nations measure progress by GDP, but GDP includes negative things like building of prisons, disaster clean-ups, etc. A more accurate measure GPI (progress)which started declining about 30 years ago.<br /><br />6. Greater consumption leads to speculative bubbles. Bhutan has a Gross National Happiness Index.<br /><br />7. Gini Coefficient measures income disparity where societies have shifted to ""Greed is good"" philosophy which at high levels as it is now, always leads to social and health problems with people rebelling.<br /><br />8. Beginning in the 80's banks migrated from low risk investments to high risk ones including derivatives, high leverage, Credit Default Swaps, naked derivatives, unrestricted capital flows allowed speculators to get money out of countries fast if bets went bad leaving countries to suffer, front-running to exacerbate trends, repeal of Glass-Steagall, etc.<br /><br />In sum, a very good look into the problems we face, though the author's solution is more speculative, but a good way to get our discussions started, so we can head in a better direction than we are now going. So, a fine book, even for neo-liberal supporters so that they know what is brewing.",Positive
"This book is interesting, especially if you are particularly interested in the Mexican border city of Juarez. The author is an American who visited the city recently. Some things I found noteworthy from the book are.....<br /><br />1. Some cities are known for seafood, some for air pollution, etc, Juarez is ""easy to forget."" Juarez is an ideal location from which to move illegal drugs to US cities like Dallas, Denver, Chicago and Manhattan.<br /><br />2. When the author went there in 2009, the first things he saw were two dead bodies, plus about 30 ""federales"" hanging around the bodies and everyone seeming untroubled. The murder rate was about 2700/yr when he got there. If the police do a good job and ID the killer in such murders it is likely they will be killed in retaliation, so no great effort to investigate. Same with newspaper reporters, don't look into killings because afraid of being killed.<br /><br />3. The author meets Marco who plays for the Indios, a Juarez soccer team. When author asks him why he lives in Juarez, he says to look at YouTube - for videos of the Indios and excitement they generate.<br /><br />4. The author was drawn to Juarez because of all the murders, also kidnappings, carjackings and extortion - extortion has closed so many businesses that Juarez is no longer a tourist hot spot. So, he wanted to understand it better, plus because of all this, he felt he could rent an apartment cheaply.<br /><br />5. Juarez has a population of about 2 million, but now maybe about one million since so many have fled to El Paso, Veracruz, AZ, CA, Chicago and Denver.  Some rich people in Juarez live in El Paso and commute. El Paso is the 3rd safest US city, because of all the wealthy Mexicans who live there. Juarez is ugly - burning tires, slums, poorly built bridges, bad climate - dust storms, heat. Employment is why everyone is in Juarez. Author also wants to better understand Juarez since Mexico influences so much of US culture. The author also notices so many like the soccer team, like to drink, and make love. The city has an energy the author likes. Mexico is where US fads go for an encore - Yellow Pages, Blockbuster Video stores, etc. Most people intentionally drive jalopies with dents, cracked wind shields, etc to avoid being stolen, carjacked, etc.<br /><br />6. Around 1917, Prohibition in the US changed Juarez to a place for Americans to go for bars, liquor, etc. NAFTA, later caused Juarez to become Mexico's 5th Largest city.<br /><br />7. El Kartel - Indios fan club - author joined it - they have a lot of fun. Indios team priest - ""When you are rich, etc you don't need God"" Juarez, like Mexico is heavily Catholic and it is evident everywhere - tapestries, churches, etc. Dental tourism was popular until all the violence. The author learned to stay in his apartment at night. Other than the Indios, most people in Juarez are out of shape, probably mostly because of the food.<br /><br />8. Lots of ""Amor por Juarez' stickers around. America is considered boring, whereas Mexicans are a happy people - everyone knows their neighbors. But, so many are leaving because of the violence. Before Juarez became known as the murder capital of the world, it was known for its murder of women - femicide. There have been lots of US movies about it, however most likely a myth as statistics match even some similar size US cities, especially in inner city neighborhoods, like Philadelphia.<br /><br />9. Some soccer teams in Mexico are sponsored by large universities and players aren't students - maybe the US can learn from this.<br /><br />10. Drugs affect lower level soccer teams. It is a backbone to the Mexican economy, along with oil and tourism. Not likely that the Indios are not laundering drug money since they are not that good of a team.<br /><br />11. The author eventually feels part of Juarez and loves it, but is told if he stays longer he will know some of the people being killed. So, the last straw for him was when car bombs started to occur in Juarez - but, worse, sites cleaned up as if nothing happened, nothing on TV, etc.<br /><br />So, the title of the book, ""This love is not for cowards."" Interesting book.",Positive
"This book is interesting, but definitely of more interest to someone who is specifically interested in the USS Enterprise, than someone just generally interested in some military history.

"This is an interesting memoir of a Wall Street insider's look at his life, so far,  and his experiences in Wall Street. Things of note...<br /><br />1. His grandfather, Ruby, told him all you have is your name and your word, and that honesty, trust, and respect were the foundation of any successful endeavor. Over the years, Todd confused net worth with self-worth. Dad left when he was 2, Mom and Todd moved from house in NJ to apartment in Great Neck, LI. He was diagnosed with ADHD, didn't fit in socially, placed in private school, 7th grade in Great Neck South Middle School, Bagel shop boy at 13 - learned if you want money get a job. Still had ADHD, but did well in sports and had a pretty traditional childhood. Jr and Sr year HS spent in CA to be with dad. Applied to UC Santa Barbara, San Diego State, Boston U., and Syracuse. Went to Syracuse,  good education, sports program, fraternity, did well. Met friend Kevin Wassong at Syracuse, talked about working together sometime, Kevin got job at reative Arts Agency, Todd got a business degree, in finance so to be near the ""cash register."" Todd got an internship at Morgan Stanley, then hired by them after school - Chuck Feldman made  the offer.<br /><br />2. At MS, clueless at first, worked at the equity derivative desk. Slow, but learned - ""Buy-write"" - long calls, short stock, ""synthetic put"" - long stock, short calls - ""married put"" ,long put, long stock.<br /><br />3. Jim Cramer called, ""Do you like  ....what do you think? Todd said ""yeah,"" Cramer hung up. Learned to give quick answer, not waste time.<br /><br />4. 1st yr  - $28K, no bonus. One incident told sell something, couldn't, told to lie.<br /><br />5. 2nd yr - same, no bonus, warning, 3rd yr,/1993 - $75K, 4th yr, $150K<br /><br />6. Had a big loss with First Interstate Bank, learned money makes you do things you don't like, became arrogant, cocky, innocence gone replaced with power.<br /><br />7. Saw that WS had an uncanny ability to recreate, repackage and sell risk. And, saw steady stalwarts  passed over for promotions - bad things happening to good people - all politics. Then, he was ""ambushed"" - told he couldn't be trusted, joined the Galleon Group hedge fund, they needed a derivative specialist. Struggled at first with Galleon - no bonus, told lucky to have a job. Then, Asian contagion, Greenspan stimuli, seeds of dot.com bubble which evolved into booms and busts in next decades.. By 1999, things were good, he began to covet things, wanted to be a partner.<br /><br />8. Moved to Cramer-Berkowitz hedge fund as partner, smaller $400M fund, base salary $300K + % of profits, ran trading operation. Cramer was  master of momentum and Berkowitz had a brilliant analytical mind. After Cramer threw a tantrum over a bad trade, Todd saw the true colors - you are only as good as your last trade - never the same for him. 4/2000 NASDAQ dropped 20%, in Summer, Cramer had Todd write column for Street.com - ""The switch was flipped."" Dad in jail in Hawaii, Bipolar like Cramer, Todd decided to leave, $5M final paycheck, $700K annual salary at the time. Cramer went on to CNBC, Berkowitz headed fund, Todd went to Street.com to write.<br /><br />9. 9-11 hit, falling out with Street.com, decided to leave.<br /><br />10. Met Casey Cannon, entertainment field, found bridge between finance and entertainment, Minyanville was born with ""Hoofy and Boo"" characters, launched  10/2002 along with the Ruby Peck Foundation. 12/2002, quit Berkowitz-Cramer, Street.com and started own small hedge fund. But made wrong call after financial collapse, didn't anticipate strong recovery, was wiped out. Became depressed. It took losing nearly everything to understand what real wealth was - happiness is not in a bank account.. Fork in the road, almost insolvent, decided to focus on Minyanville and foundation, Kevin Wassong joined him - remembered, ""do whaat you love and the money will come."" Minyanville won an Emmy. Finally, real success. In business, be an animal, in life, be yourself.<br /><br />So, a pretty good memoir. My thinking from the book, is that he was successful at Galleon, because he had good tips, but recent uncovering of insider trading at Galleon, Todd was only successful because he was given illegal info, though he probably didn't know it was illegal. And, his success trading at Cramer-Berkowitz, was because Cramer, a genius of momentum, caught the dot.com bubble run-up just right. His real talent was in learning the inside of Wall Street and writing about it in an entertaining way. So, a worthwhile book, in learning a little bit about one of the Wall Street players and his connections.",Positive
"I found the book to be enjoyable. It's a memoir, the life story of the comedian, Sarah Silverman, where she seems pretty sincere in writing about what appear to be the major milestones of her life. She does not hold back in her forthright profuse description of sexual and potty stuff, while also revealing a person with very moral and ethical values when it comes to the really important things the world faces. From the book, I found these things worth noting:<br /><br />1.She writes about her bedwetting as a youth and how it affected her, depressing her quite a bit. Her father and his father were also bedwetters. The depression peaked with her taking as many as 16 Xanax pills a day<br /><br />2. She talks about a key bad experience with a boyfriend, early on.<br /><br />3. She became a vegetarian out of her concern for animals.<br /><br />4. At 13, when visiting her sister at Berkeley, she got exposed to drugs by a neighbor of hers and he also gave her a gift of Playgirl and Penthouse magazines, and she claims that is what really began her focusing on sexual stuff for her comedy. Since the 3rd grade, she always knew she wanted to be a comedian.<br /><br />5. Her parents never hit her and they encouraged her and gave her lots of love. Beginning at age 15 her parents let her take shuttle trips from New Hampshire to New York City and she knew early on she wanted to eventually get out of New Hampshire and live in NYC. She said she felt like a goat among sheep in NH, but a goat among goats in NYC. She enrolled at NYU, majoring in drama, in Greenwich Village after HS. She would hand out flyers at a comedy club after classes eventually getting chances to do stand-up. She then quit NYU before starting her sophomore year and her dad offered to pay for her to live in NYC since it would be cheaper than going to NYU and he knew what she really wanted to do anyway - comedy, so she did that, living in Greenwich Village.<br /><br />6. Never had stage fright - she thinks because after she stopped bedwetting, nothing could be as embarrassing as that.<br /><br />7. Her approach to everything gross in life like drugs, sex, etc is to ""make it a treat,"" that is everything in moderation.<br /><br />8. At 22 she got interviewed by Saturday Night Live and got hired as a writer/performer, however none of her skits made it past dress rehearsal and coincidentally or not was fired after one year after hitting Al Franken in the temple with a sharp pencil - a joke gone bad.  She claims Chris Farley positively influenced her with an incident where Farley had been with SNL 3 years, but was still in awe of what had gone on before he came there. So, it gave her the strength to face future challenges.<br /><br />9. Always felt she didn't know how to dress and her disastrous Emmy Awards dress was a result.<br /><br />10. Being creative, she puts in a midword in her book, to take a break and say what she was doing when not writing. Likewise, she wrote her own foreword in the book - she claims groundbreaking.<br /><br />11. She writes about disputes with the publisher/editor about things like the title and other stuff.<br /><br />12. She writes about the racism she sees in the media - more nuanced than in the past - really uses her comedy to fight racism.<br /><br />13. She writes about her incidents as host at MTV award shows - and her loss of tact with her comments about Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.<br /><br />14. Writes about her film, ""Jesus is Magic"" and the ""Sarah Silverman Program"" on Comedy Central and how the network was tolerant of her edgy stuff also showing some of the hate mail she received about how God was presented in her program.  Also writes about her pro-union position even when facing cost control issues from the network.<br /><br />15. She talks about love and that she only really needs a man around a lot is for watching TV while cuddling in bed.<br /><br />17. Near the end of the book she has a chapter writing about being a Jew and what she thinks about Judaism - although she is secular she thinks Judaism is an OK religion, with many criticisms about Catholicism like the ostentacious Vatican and the child-abusing priests. When her parents divorced, although the divorce worked out well, she did spend time in a convent while her mom worked, and she was very critical of the violence used by the nuns for discipline. She realizes she comes across as a Jew and for that Jews like her and she is proud of ""The Great Schlep"" where she helped Obama win support of Florida's elderly Jews. She then has an afterward where she has God reflect about things like being nice to her in letting her finish the book.<br /><br />Overall, since Sarah Silverman is controversial, I recommend the book for those who like her, but probably not for those who don't.",Positive
"The book is very helpful to newcomers to Createspace who want to self-publish books with them. Some helpful tips were:<br /><br />1. First steps - a) Decide B+W or color - B+W much cheaper, b) Decide on book size -e.g. 6""x9"", c) Pick color of pages - recommend cream for novel, white for nonfiction, d) Consider ProPlan pricing or not, e) Suggest photos @ 300DPI. f) Create account at [...], g) Createspace will assign ISBN and EAN numbers for free h) Decide how the book will be marketed - either at Amazon.com or the Createspace e-store, or both.<br /><br />2. Book uses MS Word and Powerpoint as ways to create text and cover. So, less helpful for readers who want to use other products. Suggests title page, copyright page, dedication page, table of contents, plus other tips including page layout, fonts - recommends serif for titles, non-serif for text, raster graphics not vector, title on spine only if book more than 130 pages, front cover should look good whereas back cover should appeal to reason. Must create PDF files.<br /><br />3. Then upoad PDF files.<br /><br />In summary, helpful for newcomers to Createspace, plus underscores that one can self-publish a book for free, the only charges are for any proof copies ordered and, optionally, for the Pro Plan, currently at $39, which allows the author to receive higher royalties. Also, the contract is non-exclusive, so the author can cancel at anytime and sign with another publisher.",Positive
"""Simplexity"" analyses various things and deduces how they are either simple or complex, the purpose being that we should look a little deeper into things before making consequential decisions.  Sounds like pretty much common sense, and it is to a degree, but the book does highlight some scientific insights which might help the reader in approaching some situations. Here are some items which the book presents which I think are worthwhile:<br /><br />1. It is the region between order and disorder which gives complexity. For instance, a piece of copper pipe can be thought of as a simple piece of frozen solid, but it gets more complex as a network of plumbing in a skyscraper, and extremely compex at the subatomic level.<br /><br />2. Any system must be seen at all levels before determining if it is complex.<br /><br />3. The stock market may seem complex, but major changes in it come more from some bland pieces of information, rather than from some catastrophic news events.<br /><br />4. With experiments involving how people will divide up money, they show that we ""appear to be wired for justice"".<br /><br />5. Although human behavior can't be mathematized, it is influenced thusly. For example, 1.3M people die in auto accidents globally, yet something as simple as well placed speed bumps could reduce that amount quite significantly, since there is about an 80% death rate when accidents happen above 35mph.<br /><br />6. Fads spread faster rather than by first influencing the most popular people first, but by first influencing a smaller number of people but those having a close relationship with the originator.<br /><br />7. Politically, it is better to market ideas about a candidate which voters already think, than by breaking bigger, more surprising things. Hence, a simple approach is more effective in such situations.<br /><br />8. Complicated work skills appear at some of the least prestigous jobs. For instance, truck drivers must process visual, tactile, auditory and cognitive skills all instantaneously.<br /><br />9. Animals have about 1B heartbeats per lifetime, influenced by the mass of the animal. Based on that, humans should only live to age 20 or so, but they are the exception because they use their brains to ""game the system"".<br /><br />10. Since humans survive by converting carbs to CO2 + H2O + energy, perhaps inorganic substances share overlapping similarities with humans since CO2 and H2O also are associated with them, like with cities compared with humans.<br /><br />11. Zipf's Law - certain mathematical patterns appear as how often centain words and terms show up in text. Therefore, maybe similar patterns show up elsewhere, like income, size of corporations and urban populations. They do seem to do so.<br /><br />12. ""Probability neglect"" - people seem to fear a catastophic event (terrorist attack) rather than a more chronic one (climate change) when the chronic one can cause greater harm. Apparently, there are two systems for analyzing risk, automatic (feelings) and more thoughtful (experience).<br /><br />13. ""Availability heuristic"" - the better able it is to summon an image of a dangerous event, the easier it is to be afraid of it.<br /><br />14. In the computer world, it has been said ""there are two kinds of people, software engineers and those who are afraid of them"".<br /><br />15. Muhammad Yunnis, who pioneered microloans, showed that surgical strikes, so to speak, are more effective in reducing poverty, but that involves complex analysis.<br /><br />16. The Pareto principle applies to an 80:20 rule when looking at income distribution, but also shows up in all sorts of things.<br /><br />17. For the arts, complexity falls flat, but there is still a connection.  Sure, in music, but also in art, reflective of nature's quasicrystals, which have seemingly symmetric patterns though they never repeat. Jackson Pollack's paintings exhibit the mathematical concept of fractals.<br /><br />So, overall, if one wants to ponder how the mind works or might work better, there are some helpful thoughts here.",Positive

Most teachers have been in a tough position at some point. And the good ones find a way to master their own sense of balance, their craft, and to structure a class and day that inspires kids to do better. The portraits he paints of his students are caricatures of the ugliest kind. Worst, he fails to realize that fear and loathing will never bring kids around- only love will. Even more enraging, he uses his time with them to make more money.",Negative

"I'm so disapointed with this cookbook!<br /><br />The recipes are for a beginner, besides not having one picture in this book is a<br />big turn off to me about any cookbook.<br /><br />I have been cooking for my family, and now Grandchildren for years, and truthfully I do<br />not know how this got such good ratings!! The recipes are a no brainer.<br />For a slow cooker cookbook, it does say allot of recipes have to put in a frying pan first!!<br />For meat recipes I always would, to get the fat off.<br /><br /> Allot of the recipes you do not need a slow cooker for, I think!.<br />Such as :Black and white bean dip, ,black bean and corn dip, pizza dip, Cranberry dip,<br />Rosemary-Garlic mashed potatoes!<br />There are allot more recipes that would take 15 mins on the stove to make, and using<br />a slow cooker would not enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Most of the recipes call for a 4 quart slow cooker.<br /> I just bought the 6 quart slow cooker!!<br />.<br />The Creek style meatballs and artichokes calls for a 6 to 7 qt.<br />It also said to use 2 slices of white sandwich bread!<br />I do not call that healthy . Its as bad for you as eating Marshmellows.<br />For most of the sauces it calls for bottled sauces, which are full of Salt etc.<br /><br />Tried two recipes , they where easy, but nothing special.Tasted good.<br /><br />The book does give the information on:<br />Calories, fat, sodium, carbs, fiber and protein.<br />I do not see where it says what a Serving is!!<br /><br />Does give some tips at the beginning of the book how to use your slow cooker etc.Simple and to the point.<br /><br />I do think this cookbook would be good for a new cook who is new at using a slow cooker.<br /><br />I also want to mention. The old slow cookers / CrockPots all have Lead and Cadium in the<br />glaze. As we are finding out, so does older colored dinner ware, and new dinner ware.<br />Although new dishes have a lower amount of Lead and Cadium.<br /><br />California sets the law for the whole country on how much lead and cadium can be in cookware, dinner ware etc.<br /><br />California sets the standard lower then other states would want. All older Lead Crystal goblets have a higher amount of lead then new crystal goblets.<br />I believe white porcelian dinnerware has less lead, or none,  then other dishes as the fireing is very high, and would not do well if it had lead in it.<br /><br />I have nothing to do with  hamilton beach, but they are the only ones that make a enexpensive slow cooker without any lead or cadium. I had to do allot of research to find this.<br /> Its the programable hamilton beach that Amazon sells.",Negative
"This is a nice book, with nice pictures, BUT,<br /><br /> For me This cookbook has way to much Butter, Salt, Fats, and sugar.<br />Since we do not eat like that any more, we feel Much Better, and have allot more<br />energy.<br /><br /> If your want to eat healthier, or are a Diabetic, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />I gave this 2 stars, for the Pictures and the Presentation.",Negative
"I'm not as impressed with this book as most of the reviewers are!<br /><br />But I do have to say, the pictures are in color,(which I like), big, and very nice photogrophy (most of them!). There is also info on chicken coops , and your basic raising of regular chickens.<br />There is only info here about feeding your chickens regular food.<br /><br />  I was looking for a book that also told about feeding your birds healther food, so the eggs would be healthier. I was interested in the eggs, not watching how to kill chickens.I also was not planning on killing my birds, but I gress that comes with chicken books!!<br /> I do know if you feed your chickens ground up flax seed, along with there food, your eggs yokes will have Omega-3 in them. (proven fact) Also let them be free range during the day.<br /><br />  That said, I thought it was disgusting when it came to how she kills her chickens, and the<br />picture of the chicken being held down with a broom handle over its neck,chocking it to death,while she is standing on the broom, till she cuts its artery, But the chicken is still not dead!.<br /><br />  Then she shows how to put the chicken in a Killing Cone, that allows just its head and neck sticking out the small end (not a bad idea, but).<br />""The killing cone helps to prevent the bruising that can occur when the bird Flaps and Struggles while it bleeds out"" Which says to me. That chicken that was your Pet, is now in pain and struggling in pain till its death!<br />Also the cone will keep the blood from splattering on you!!!..<br />  I'm not a farmer, this made me sick!  I live on a few acres with animals, but we do not kill them..<br /><br />  I do eat chicken (not much. after this book, maybe not at all), but if anyone thinks this is a great picture book for little kids, I do not know where your coming from, Or what your thinking!!<br /><br />I gave this book two stars for the pictures, and some commen info about chickens.",Negative
"I did not expect this type of book.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be on how to train my dogs, but it talked about all<br />Amimals can be train with this mothod.<br /><br /> It basicly talked about giving any animal a treat when they did good, and doing bad did not get anything..<br /> No matter what your animal was doing if it was good, like sitting looking out the window, give her/him a treat..<br /><br /> I didn't think it took that many page to get the point across..",Negative

A woman literally follows her dreams to find the right guy. It just doesn't turn out the way she expects it to turn out.,Positive
"While Ms Heller writes great rom-com, and this book definitely has some of that here, her foray into mystery was very successful. The clues are all there and the murder makes sense. Good job!<br /><br />PS Read the story to understand subject line! 😉",Positive
Remember when Edna and Maggie followed Jake to that one building in Book 1? It Had a detective agency and psychic? Well those are Finn and Zia respectively. They work together to discover who trashed their offices and learn that maybe neither is as bad as they first thought.<br /><br />The novellas are cute but nowhere near as good as the series itself. Can't wait to see what happens on Wednesday and to whom! Book 4 hinted at a problem between Matt and Cassie. Or maybe we'll learn about young love through Piper and Drew. Or will we experience the teen years with Dylan or find out what Chad the Cheater has been up to. So many fun possibilities!,Positive
"A good 4 stars as it keeps you coming back for more, it isn't  hard core but gets the points across, but it offers love and hope for those left behind.",Positive
My 5 year old loves Fancy Nancy. These books are great,Positive
this is one of my favorite books to read to my daughter about the baby.  she loves pulling out the flaps and seeing the baby grow.,Positive
I guess I should have read more about this. I thought it was a workbook for homeschooling but it’s a book-book for reading. It’s educational at least but it’s not very organized. There are no chapters or sections. It jumps from one part to the other on each page throughout.,Positive
So far so good. My second grader is on the letter U so far. There are only 1 or 2 letters so far that I didn’t care for the style(as in it wasn’t how I was taught cursive). He asked me if he could learn cursive and this is what I gave him. He likes it!,Positive
Like it and easy to read but some of the formatting differs from what I've learned from other sources...I do not know who is correct?,Positive
very compelling wish there were more on allergies and soy and gluten issues in food.,Positive
Really good - nice change back to traditional haunts...I miss that - although the sci fi time travel was an added twist.,Positive
"I thought I would get a books with interesting facts about 1950.  There were only 2 pages and it did not even include the most popular book of the year (a serious mistake to me).  It was basically a journal, which I did not need.  Was looking for more facts.",Negative
"I loved the first book in the series and anxiously awaited this.  It started slow, but did pick up at the end.  Sometimes the four main characters were not clearly defined.  They seemed to be lumped as four Americans in Scotland.  I would like to see more individuality in each.  I do enjoy the premise and will continue to read the series.",Positive
I really liked the unique perspective of the main character. Her point of view as an honest thief was refreshing and interesting. But the story felt shallow and the climax was lacklustre.,Negative
"As you can see in the pictures, three out of four of the cover corners were not finished properly.  I did not see anywhere that this book was ""seconds"" quality.  Beccause I am leaving tomorrow to go and visit my grandson, I will repair this myself and keep the book, otherwise I would have returned it.",Negative
"Start by saying I love Lucas Davenport books. BUT this is not even close to the best of them. I miss all the people we are used to, Del, Shrake, Jenkins, Virgil, Sandy, Rose Marie, & even Weather (who I could do without) & the governor. The Bad Guys are given way too much time - they aren't interesting at all, unlike most of Mr. Sandford's criminals. The plot is very sketchy & pretty uninteresting. Letty is a little flaky as usual & that part was ok. It is worth reading but don't look for the usual ""can't put down until the last dog is dead"". It is easy to put down, but also easy to pick up again. So, I am again waiting for the next Prey book & am pretty sure it will be back to the best ever mystery series. We are all very interested in what Lucas is going to do now that he is out of the BCA, & hoping that it doesn't mean that the series is ending!!",Positive
"it's very intense and disturbing. I don't think I'll buy another from this author. it's pretty graphic and gory. however, it arrived on time and packaged well. and now I find they've made it into a movie!",Positive

But having said that, he is very new to writing and will, no doubt, get better with each endeavor. Plus, he did better than I could do! so I wasn't disappointed with this purchase and I did enjoy reading it.",Positive
I was very disappointed in the story.course it was a 'short' story but it just didn't keep you interested. the best thing I can say for it was atleast it was short.,Negative
"while I absolutely adore almost everything James Patterson writes, I'm not a fan of his on this particular storyline. It's just me and I'm sure almost everyone else will find it riveting.",Positive

I loved reading how mouse and Thomas came about. I'm not sure about Laura's father though. No one writes about Wizard fights like Jim Butcher.,Positive
Love this coloring book!,Positive
"This is a pretty interesting book about Method Acting. It has been often used to define American acting in the 1950s and 1970s, my favorite decades for acting. The 1960s had it wane then begin gaining strength with Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. I miss the love of acting and see most mass market movies as not being acting at all but humans just augment the special effects. The book is most interesting at the beginning and the end, the middle is more of a confusing muddle, which I believe happened The Method.",Positive
The author looks are several inventions of writing.  The most interesting was quipu from the Incas to me. A very interesting book.,Positive
"Four people during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine strives to live and improve their country. Russia invades the West, strikes down a Malaysian Airliner and destroys buildings. A pro-Russian president takes over Ukraine and protestors drive him out. The lives of these four characters highlight the experience on the ground, ordinary life. Well written.",Positive
I love Stacy Abrams and have read a nonfiction book of hers and liked it. But this is a really pedestrian novel and I didn't find anything outstanding about it.,Negative
The author travels the Lena River in Siberia and learns the culture and people who live there. He looks back at Russia’s history and present. Very good and very interesting.,Positive
"John Lennon at 37 is heading out to his island Dornish in Ireland. This novel Imagines what those 3 visits might have been like, especially the third. He buys the island in 1967 and visits briefly with Cynthia and later with Yoko but he spent 3 days there in 1978 with a friend doing scream therapy. The novel is made up of mostly dialogue between a John and his friend. They are amusing quips you might have imagined from John. Sweet but not complete.",Negative
I didn't see the term Anarchist Interventions when I borrowed this from the library. I agree with many of the ideas in loosening borders. I don't believe that there can't he borders. There hasn't really been times when there hasn't been borders of some kind. This book uses a lot of jargon geared towards mostly academic audiences and like minded readers. It expresses a lot of terrible and horrible abuses that need to end but it doesn't seem to have any idea to run a government or society and its claims see to invite more cruel in place of others. Sounds a lot like communism and not a pleasant version. The jargon! The jargon!,Negative
Chernobyl is a huge tragedy that I remember reading about and crying about when it happened. Strangely enough I felt detached from the book and the miniseries.  Not sure why I couldn't relate. I haven't found he right book to relate this tragedy too. I remember photos in the newspapers at the time and powerful reporting.,Positive
"Scott Pelley tells many great stories about journalism me has experienced many important news stories. This is a very interesting book especially the section on 9/11. He discusses his interviews with Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Trump.  Obama is untouched. A strength and a weakness is that the book reads like a 60 Minutes show. Nonpartisan, honest and truthful but somewhat filled. To provide the journalism he supports, he puts on the emotional brakes.",Positive
"Not as satisfying as the One Love picture book, this is still sweet. The book uses Bob Marley's lyrics with very nice illustrations.",Positive
"A young girl is learning to write sentences and words with her drawings. She tells stories, writes about her life and plays with words, etc. She dreams of being an author like the one who hosted school and read a book she wrote. Nice small chapter hook for young readers.",Positive
I know Lao and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Thailand so I'm familiar with the cultures. The mystery is an interesting one and the portrayal of Laos in 1977 is fascinating.

"A good novel about WWII on Okinawa Japan.  A young man who is a member of a youth military corps is trying to survive with friends and family a battle for Okinawa between the Americans and Japan.  The island residents are technically Japanese but historically been Okinawan and speak another language.  The Japanese soldiers are under severe stress and willing to kill the residents at the drop of a hat.  They have warned them the Americans are devils who will poison them with tainted food and water if they accept help.  The boy does accept help from the Americans but has trouble too.  Nothing is clear and safety is tenuous.  The only thing he has to protect himself and his family is a grenade that he was given in school.  But should he use it?  And whom should he use it on?  A pretty good book but I was disappointed that it was not as good as Refugee, the author's last novel which won several awards.",Positive

Mac b flies to Europe for the first time and suspects a Soviet spy from the KBG of being the theif.  Mac B is on the case!  I found it really helpful for my students learning English because is contained visuals that assisted understanding, clear humor, and lots of great information not told in a heavy handed way.  Very helpful to my ESOL students.  Especially older kids who read English at a lower level right now.  I found it funny!",Positive
A Skill Practice workbook for 2nd graders.  It uses standards based activities such as fluency reading and writing prompts.  A weekly assessment is included.,Positive
Good book about workouts for women. The author demonstrates many exercises and the proper form for them. She introduces equipment and their uses. She also provides a blueprint for starting out with exercise and a series of exercises to begin with and build up to in weekly increments. Helpful.,Positive
"The author explains in a forward that every culture has a different image they see on the moon when they look st it. In Korean cultures rabbit near to a mortar is seen, not a man’s face.  She creates a lively read aloud for young children about this rabbit on the moon holding a bucket of stars. After throwing stars in the sky the rabbit comes to visit Eatth for a short to spread good will and feeling before returning in the morning.  A very quiet story perfect for bedtime.",Positive

"No this isn't like the other books they have written. It doesn't have lots and lots of sex in it. What it does have are strong characters, a good story line  and funny laugh out loud moments. I liked being in Carter & Evie's world for a while. What would they do to each other next ? Would they get together or be apart?  It will be one I will be rereading.",Positive
"What a disappointment!  The first-person narrator in THE SILENT PATIENT is a damaged, self-absorbed psychotherapist who should never have been allowed to treat patients.  He is not quite an ""unreliable narrator"", but is very, very close to one.  The much-admired plot twist is contrived and unbelievable.  The ending is a total letdown, and would be stronger, in my opinion, if the perp were allowed to get away with everything.  The writing is competent but plain.  This isn't really a mystery, and I regret wasting both time and money (Kindle $10.99) on it.",Negative
"THE WAND CHOOSES THE WIZARD (Harry Potter) is a rather silly interactive book that may amuse a child for a little while.  The book is battery-operated, and it comes with a battery-operated plastic wand.  (Fortunately, the appropriate disc batteries are included and already installed.)  The child needs to be old enough to know NOT to poke someone in the eye with the wand.<br /><br />When you read through the book, which summarizes the way that Harry Potter used his wand throughout the whole series of Potter books, you come to diagrams of various wand-assisted spells.  If you like, you can use the wand to perform the wand motion that accompanies the spell.  Then if you press the button on the wand and touch the wand to the diagram in the book, the book plays the spell (e.g., “Accio”) as pronounced by Harry in the Potter movies.<br /><br />The book isn’t very expensive (about $10.50 on Amazon), but a child will probably tire of it quickly.  A child who has read the Potter books won’t need the explanatory text in the book at all.  As an adult, I lost interest as soon as I realized that the spell recording would play whenever I touched the wand tip to a spell diagram and pressed the button--there is no need to actually wave the wand in the appropriate pattern to activate the recording.",Negative
"INCREDIBLE PLANT-BASED DESSERTS: COLORFUL VEGAN CAKES, COOKIES, TARTS, AND OTHER EPIC DELIGHTS offers a fairly wide variety of fairly ordinary recipes for “plant-based” desserts (e.g., cakes, tarts, jam, bars, muffins, cookies).  What sets the recipes apart, is that they call for ingredients like “plant-based milk (such as almond, soy, or coconut)”, “light-tasting vegetable oil, such as sunflower”, vegan butter, nut butter, coconut sugar, etc.<br /><br />The recipes are tested for use with these alternatives to cow’s milk or butter or refined sugar.  The finished desserts look like they will taste good--not like “health food”.<br /><br />The photographs are nice, but not eye-catching or mouth-watering, because they are just printed on the pages like the rest of the book.  (There are no ""color plates"", as one reviewer described the color photos.)  The author does demonstrate considerable skill at decorating cakes and desserts.<br /><br />However, I can’t see any reason to buy this book, unless you are a vegetarian who does NOT eat dairy or egg products.  Most desserts are already mostly plant-based (made with flour and sugar) with only dairy products and/or eggs added.",Negative
"I’ve read and enjoyed two of the author’s “Darko Dawson” mysteries, but THE MISSING AMERICAN (AN EMMA DJAN INVESTIGATION) left me cold.  The language is so stilted that it kept me from ever getting immersed in the story.  The characters and their actions are reported on--always described in neutral prose (e.g., “After getting off the line with Derek, Gorden sat listless and depressed at the edge of the bed in the hotel room”)--rather than having their stories revealed through their individual viewpoints.<br /><br />The private investigator (Emma) is a wimp with unrealistic expectations.  She graduates from the Ghana police academy, and is unhappy because she can’t immediately work on homicide investigations.  She thinks she would be a good homicide detective because her father was one.<br /><br />However, one has to wonder about her analytic abilities, because she is caught totally off guard when a powerful superior’s promise of a transfer to homicide turns out to require sleeping with him.  Emma fights the man off, and finds out the next day that she has been dismissed from the police force.  She then goes to work for a private detective agency.<br /><br />The novel commences with the apparent assassination of a candidate for high political office.  However, the reader must wait a long, long time before the story returns to this scene.  Much of the story concerns a “sakawa boy” (Nii Kwei), who makes a lot of money by ensnaring trusting Americans with Internet swindles.<br /><br />Nii works with a fetish priest (Mr. Ponsu), who regularly extracts his own pound of flesh from Nii (sacrificial chickens, the hair of a white woman, etc.).  Whether the African Internet scams really work in this fashion, I do not know.<br /><br />In the novel, an American widower (Gordon Tilson) travels to Ghana to see a young widow he has met on the Internet (and has given money to).  Then he disappears.  His son (Derek) follows him to Ghana, and hires the private detective agency that Emma now works for.  Eventually the two of them discover what happened to Gordon, and uncover the source of a lot of Ghana’s political corruption.<br /><br />The last “Darko Dawson” novel ended with a possibly fatal attack on the detective.  I guess that the author really did kill Darko off.  That’s too bad, because Darko was many, many times more interesting than the private investigator Emma.  This is a very slow-moving, wordy novel, and--unlike the Darko novels--it doesn’t do much justice to the Ghana setting.",Negative
"Given the easy-to-read writing style and the introspective heroine, THE BOOK OF SECOND CHANCES would appear to be aimed at a young adult audience--but that can’t be right, because the heroine (Emily) is 28 years old.  When the novel opens, Emily is living alone in a home that she shared with her recently deceased grandmother (Catriona, a beloved children’s book author).  Emily is barely functioning, because she relied on Catriona for everything--companionship, food and shelter, and work as Catriona’s illustrator.<br /><br />Fortunately for Emily, Catriona foresaw Emily’s predicament, and took steps to forestall her granddaughter’s descent into hopeless depression.  Catriona left everything she owned to Emily (bank accounts, book rights, furniture, etc.), with one exception.  This was the rented home that she and her granddaughter had shared for many years, and the home could also be Emily’s--if Emily would follow a series of clues and find a secret.  If Emily found the secret before the lease was up (in 10 days), she would be able to purchase the home at fair market value.<br /><br />At this point, I gave up.  The world doesn’t need another “treasure hunt” novel where the main character follows clues in order to uncover a life-changing or history-changing secret--or at least it doesn’t need another one with weak characters and plotting, where the only reason to keep on reading is to see what the next clue will be.<br /><br />At the novel’s beginning, Emily is so helpless (she is an extremely immature young adult, who is angry at her grandmother for leaving her), and the prize is so boring (a house), that I simply don’t care what happens next.  Also, the whole premise--that a dying Catriona would set up a treasure hunt for Emily which required a whole series of different people to timely contact or interact with Emily to make it work--is not only unbelievable, it is fantastical and weird.",Negative
"The introduction to CHANEL’S RIVIERA: GLAMOUR, DECADENCE, AND SURVIVAL IN PEACE AND WAR, 1930-1944 states: “This book is neither a biography of Chanel nor a history of the Riviera . . . but the story of the years during which Chanel spent her summers in that part of France.”  That statement isn’t true--the book actually IS a biography of Chanel, just a biography organized around her activities and the people she interacted with during her “War years”.<br /><br />Generally I’m NOT a biography fan, and the fact that the book held my interest for a few chapters is a testament to the author’s skill at weaving factual detail into an interesting narrative.  I was struck by the number of famous artists, composers, and political figures that moved in the social circles of Chanel and her close friend Misia Sert (e.g., Huxley, Stravinsky, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, the Duke of Windsor, and many more).<br /><br />I was also struck by the enormous wealth that fashion designer Chanel accumulated from her maison de couture and from her signature fragrance, Chanel No. 5.  (Five was Chanel’s “lucky number”, and the fragrance was “No. 5” among a series presented to her by a master perfumier for her to choose from.)<br /><br />Before reading (and scanning) this book, I knew that Chanel was a Nazi collaborator during WWII; I did NOT know that she built her career through extended liasons with British, Russian, and German aristocrats.  (Chanel’s extraordinary talent as a designer, and her profound influence on the history of fashion, are indisputable.)<br /><br />However, as always happens when I try to read biography, the narrative concerning this person and that person among Chanel’s contacts began to read like endless name-dropping.  If you like biography, you can’t go wrong with this book.  But it’s a book about Chanel, her extravagant life, and the people that she knew, not a history of the years 1930-1944.",Positive
"The plot of THE CHILL: A NOVEL sounds promising--it’s about a huge reservoir that is haunted by the remnants of Galesburg, a community that was drowned when the reservoir’s dam was built to deliver water to downstate New York.  Unfortunately, the novel is almost unreadable.  Whatever story exists is buried under the sheer weight of words expended to establish an ominous atmosphere by describing minute details of a dilapidated cabin, underground NYC sewers, the reservoir’s cold currents, etc.<br /><br />By the end of Part One (about 100 of 435 pages), almost nothing has happened.  A grandmother who once lived in Galesburg “goes home” by drowning herself in the reservoir, using weighted and padlocked chains.  A New York City sewer worker starts seeing Galesburg-related hallucinations in the nearly complete water tunnel he is building.  A local sheriff kicks his drug-addicted son out of his home, telling the son he is no longer fit enough to swim the reservoir.  The son goes swimming in the reservoir, and hallucinates killing a dam inspector who has just discovered a condition that will lead to the dam’s failure.  The sewer worker’s daughter (and granddaughter of the drowned grandmother) arrives to investigate the son’s story, and realizes something is horribly wrong when the son mentions the name of a photographer who might have witnessed the killing.<br /><br />At this point, I gave up.  It’s clear that something very bad is going to happen at the reservoir, but I don’t care.  The characters aren’t memorable or well developed, and the puzzle of how Galesburg is going to get its revenge is only mildly interesting.  I certainly don’t want to read another 300 pages of overly descriptive prose to find out what happens next in the very thin overall story.",Negative
"THE MALTA EXCHANGE: A NOVEL (Cotton Malone Book 14) follows the usual “Cotton Malone” formula.  In the novel, Cotton’s freelance assignment to recover a politically explosive WWII exchange of letters between Winston Churchill and Benito Mussolini becomes the starting point for Cotton to follow a series of clues and prevent the exposure of long-hidden secrets that are best left hidden.<br /><br />This time, the secrets involve the basic theological underpinnings of the Catholic Church, as laid down by the Emperor Constantine.  Cotton ends up hunting a murderous cardinal (Pollux Gallo), who seeks to use a secret document (“Constantine’s gift”) to blackmail a conclave of cardinals into electing him Pope.  Cotton nearly loses his life at several points in the narrative.<br /><br />As usual, the novel is based on true historical events, and depicts them more or less accurately.  At novel’s end, the author explains in detail in a “Writer’s Note” what is fact and what is fiction in the story that readers have just finished.<br /><br />Researching the novel caused the author to spend a considerable amount of time on the island of Malta. The Knights of Malta (the Knights Hospitaller, established in Rome in the 11th century) ruled and controlled Malta until Napoleon invaded the island in 1798.  The author’s love of Malta is shown clearly in the novel, which at times reads like a travelogue--something that definitely slows down the narrative.<br /><br />This may not be the best novel in the long-running Cotton Malone series, but it’s well worth reading.  The characters are properly developed, and the twisty plot includes many surprising developments that are enough to keep the reader reading.",Positive
"For some reason, I can never warm to the Monkeewrench gang.  They’re the sorta-genius misfits who’ve formed Monkeewrench Software, and apparently you need to start with the early books to appreciate the personalities.  The three series novels that I’ve read are all police procedurals involving crimes that get solved with the aid of the extraordinary, almost magical, research capabilities of the Monkeewrench computer experts.<br /><br />In ICE COLD HEART: A MONKEEWRENCH NOVEL, a woman is found murdered in a bondage situation--suffocated by duct tape wound around her head.  The victim was married and well off; soon it becomes clear that she was involved in some sort of consensual relationship with her killer.<br /><br />As things develop, a picture emerges of a cruel serial killer with an ice cold heart.  By the end of the book, the detectives and the Monkeewrench crew are engaged in a race against time to save the lives of two additional women who’ve crossed paths with the killer.<br /><br />The book is well written, but the plot is thin. Much of the “story” is about the interpersonal relationships of the established characters, and about the amazing computer research performed.  Since I don’t particularly care about any of the characters, and since I am no longer awed by research feats accomplished with computers, I thought the novel was slow-moving and boring.  It was kind of all downhill after the opening few chapters and the crime scene.",Negative
"THIN ICE: A MYSTERY features Beth Rivers, a thriller writer and amateur sleuth, who is about the most unappealing female investigator that I’ve ever encountered.  She’s hiding from a kidnapper in a backwater Alaskan town, and her paranoia knows no bounds.  Absolutely everything that she encounters—starting with a man’s red and black lumberjack coat—calls up her disgusting and disturbing memories of her all-too-recent kidnapping ordeal.<br /><br />The kidnapper, Levi Brooks, was a stalker who apparently started out as a fan of Beth’s mystery/thriller fiction.  When Beth escaped, by flinging herself out of his car, she suffered brain damage that required surgery.  Her judgment was clearly affected by the trauma, as her response after waking up is (1) to check herself out of the hospital, and (2) to flee to Benedict, Alaska, a town that she selected because it’s remote and she liked its photos on the Internet.  She travels to Benedict with nothing more than a backpack, a manual typewriter, and the clothes she purchased in the hospital gift shop.<br /><br />Something that Beth failed to consider, is that it gets COLD in Alaska.  So her first problem is how to get equipped for the winter, when all she has is the cash in her money belt, and very limited access to her other funds.  Benedict is too isolated to have a strong Internet connection, and travel in and out is extremely limited.  However, Beth likes this, because the isolation makes her feel safe from the still-at-large stalker/kidnapper.<br /><br />Beth is NOT a character that I want to know more about, and the writing is rather poor.  For example, in the second paragraph, the pilot who is flying Beth to Benedict “angled his almost toothless grin in my direction”.  A “toothless grin”?  Really?  That’s not the worst of it, either, as the prose is generally stilted and wordy.<br /><br />The plot itself is nothing to write home about, and it’s made a lot less interesting than it might be, because of Beth’s constant flashbacks to her ordeal, and to her life “before”.  A sequel is probably in the works, as the story ends with a cliffhanger.  As it turns out, Beth’s brain-surgery-impaired memories haven’t been completely accurate, and she has gotten one rather significant detail completely wrong.<br /><br />The one thing that I did like about the book is the background setting.  The small Alaska town comes across as a nice place, with nice people who help each other, even though nearly everyone is hiding from something.",Negative
"There are three things that I disliked about THE EXTINCTION AGENDA.  First, the plot idea isn’t particularly original. Second, the viewpoint character (Mason) is not only immortal (surviving dangerous missions despite truly impossible odds), but also unlikeable (extremely self-centered and full of himself).  Third, the writing isn’t very good (wordy, rather stilted for a mystery/thriller, and filled with long passages about characters’ backgrounds, the planning of missions, and the organization of branches of government).<br /><br /> *****SPOILER ALERT: The novel is about a monstrous, evil conspiracy to thin the Earth’s population.  Powerful government insiders are preparing to release a “biological agent” that will kill all persons not deemed “essential” (e.g., first responders, key government figures, military leaders, infrastructure support persons).  The virus will operate selectively, because the “essential” people have already been immunized through secret additives to their routine annual shots (flu shots).<br /><br />Mason, of course, is destined to thwart the conspirators.  At the beginning of the story, he has no idea who or what is behind the “biological agent” that kills everyone who comes in contact with it.  But as he follows orders and carries out his missions, he gradually comes to understand what is really happening.*****END SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />You have to be a fan of government conspiracy thrillers to like this novel.  Unfortunately, I have little patience with them.",Negative
"THEIR LITTLE SECRET: A TOM THORNE NOVEL is a depressing book. It sort of explores the “killer couple” phenomenon, where two relatively normal people meet and spark something in each other that transforms them into co-murderers.  I’m new to the “Tom Thorne” series, so I don’t know whether this one is typical; I rather suspect that it isn’t.  This is the 16th series novel (for the first, see [[ASIN:B00B6U094U Sleepyhead]]).<br /><br />The co-killers here (Sarah and Conrad) are (1) a crazy divorcee whose life revolves around dropping off and picking up her son (Jamie) at school; and (2) a virtuoso con man who fleeces single women out of all their money.  The spark for Sarah and Conrad is an instant recognition, at their first coffee-shop meeting, that the other is NOT what he or she appears to be to other people.  That, plus incredible sex.<br /><br />In the novel, a woman (Philippa) throws herself in front of a train.  Her act is caught on video surveillance tape, so it’s clear that she’s a suicide.  But Tom Thorne suspects there is something more to her death.  In following up with Philippa’s relatives, he learns that Philippa was recently victimized by a mysterious con man (yes, Conrad), and that the experience was what drove her to suicide.<br /><br />Subsequently, a pair of seemingly unrelated murders (a young man in Margate, a local school teacher) come to Thorne’s attention, and little clues start to add up, leading Thorne inevitably to the killer couple.  However, most of the book is devoted to the relationship between Sarah and Conrad—as it initially forms, and then as it eventually breaks down.  It’s the breakdown, of course, that is the couple’s downfall.<br /><br />I don’t know whether the novel accurately depicts “killer couple” psychology.  It’s an interesting read, but depressing (as previously mentioned).  Series readers won’t want to miss it, though, because of developments in Thorne’s ongoing relationship with his estranged partner Helen.",Positive
"THE JANES: AN ALICE VEGA NOVEL is just too long.  Too many words and pages are devoted to developing (and admiring?) the “Alice Vega” character, who sounds like a sociopath.  She barely speaks to her investigative partner (the hopelessly enamoured Max Caplan aka Cap); she engages in criminal behavior (e.g., breaking and entering, beating information out of suspects) in public places in front of crowds; and she clears her mind by standing on her head for long periods of time.  However, Vega cannot be a sociopath, because she actually cares about underage children who are being exploited by human traffickers.<br /><br />There’s a fair amount of action in the book (e.g., Vega’s using gigantic bolt cutters to inflict severe injuries on a thuggy bodyguard).  Unfortunately, the most important plot-advancing scenes (e.g., Vega and Cap’s escape from their securely guarded hospital rooms) are unbelievable even by mystery/thriller standards for heroes/heroines.<br /><br />Sympathetic supporting characters (e.g., medical examiner Mia, honest detective McTiernan) are admirable in their willingness to help Vega and Cap’s cause (the finding and stopping of a child-sex operation that has already produced two “Jane Doe” corpses).  However, readers may wonder, as I did, whether any real life person would actually put his or her job and freedom on the line the way that Mia and McTiernan do.<br /><br />If you like hard-boiled female investigators, then you will probably like this novel, as Vega is as hard-boiled as they come.  The writing is professional, and the story moves along pretty well.  Of course, the story itself isn’t much—it’s just another corrupt-cops-get-their-comeuppance thing, spiced up with electroshock torture, multiple shootings and stabbings, and the aforementioned bolt-cutter beatings.  There’s also a surprise ending of sorts.<br /><br />This is the second novel in the “Alice Vega” series.  The first is [[ASIN:0385542496 Two Girls Down]], which I haven’t read, and which may or may not be better than this one.  I’m simply NOT interested in reading anything more about the impulsive, self-centered, sociopathic “Alice Vega”.",Negative
"If you’ve mastered pie crust, then pie really is “easy as pie”.  This book, THE PERFECT PIE: YOUR ULTIMATE GUIDE TO CLASSIC AND MODERN PIES, TARTS, GALLETTES, AND MORE will guide you to pie crust mastery--or you can take the easy way out (as I do) and use commercial pie crust from your grocery store’s cold case (e.g., [[ASIN:B003D1Z2E2 Pillsbury Pie Crusts]]).  Whichever approach you use, this book will provide lots of different--but fairly complicated--fillings for you.<br /><br />This is actually a technical cookbook for moderately advanced pie-makers, rather than a book for cooks who just want to bake pies that will please the family.  I really like the explanations of “Why This Recipe Works” that appear at the beginning of many recipes.  For example, the book explains that the filling in a “Skillet Apple Pie” (a recipe for a top-crust-only “pie” that begins on the stovetop and finishes in the oven) can be saucier than the filling in a double-crust pie because you don’t have to worry about a bottom crust’s becoming soggy.<br /><br />I’m NOT a fan of the “Classic” pie recipes, which add steps or non-classic ingredients to basic apple, blueberry, and pumpkin pies.  For example, apple pie uses Golden Delicious (horrors!) apples combined with Granny Smith (just okay) apples; and cooks and cools the filling before adding it to the crust.  (My Midwestern mother’s apple pie is hard to beat--it’s made with Jonathan, MacIntosh, Gravenstein, or other firm, tart-sweet apples that are tossed with cinnamon and sugar, then added to a double crust, and baked.)<br /><br />The “Classic” blueberry pie recipe adds a Granny Smith apple; the pumpkin pie recipe adds canned sweet potatoes and maple syrup, and even prebakes the crust.  These recipes aren’t really classics, and I question whether they’re worth the extra trouble.<br /><br />Sadly, there is no recipe at all for plain peach pie, which is one of the world’s great pleasures.  Peaches are used in tarts and “Peach Slab Pie”.  The “Why This Recipe Works” section for “Peach Slab Pie” says that double-crust peach pies need precooked fruit and multiple thickeners “to prevent a soupy mess”, and this has NOT been true in my experience.  Simple peach pie recipes may come out a little soupy, but they’re delicious and definitely NOT a mess.<br /><br />Of particular value are the many recipes for custard, cream, and curd pies (e.g., banana cream, lemon meringue, black bottom).  The section on regional pies (e.g., “New England Mince Pie”, “Southern Praline Pecan Pie”) is also interesting.  However, after reading the fruit pie recipes, I wonder whether these recipes will also be overly complicated for family cooks.<br /><br />Like most specialty pie-making books, this book shows you how to create a variety of crust-edge designs (braided, crimped, cutout, fork-crimped, rope, scalloped-spoon), and top-crust designs (lattice, cutout, braided strips, free-form lattice, free-form shapes, herringbone).<br /><br />A more unusual feature is the entire section on “Pie and Tart Doughs”.  This includes recipes for chocolate, herb, nut, vegan, gluten-free, cookie-crust, and other pie doughs.<br /><br />The book has many, many beautiful illustrations of finished pies--all of coffee-table-book quality.  Many procedures (e.g., removing the seeds from vanilla bean pods, making and rolling slab pie dough) are clearly explained with step-by-step photos.  The book also includes a few pages on troubleshooting pie problems (e.g., crust edges brown too quickly), and it is well-indexed.<br /><br />This book will make a nice gift for a dedicated pie maker or cookbook collector.  However, it won’t replace my go-to family-pie-making books, [[ASIN:1118432169 Betty Crocker’s Big Book of Pies and Tarts]], and [[ASIN:0470485531 Pillsbury’s Easy As Pie]].",Positive
"Although I love LEGO and miniatures, I’ve never been particularly interested in building microscale LEGO models--there is too much loss of detail in the end.  This book, LEGO MICRO CITIES:  BUILD YOUR OWN MINI METROPOLIS!, illustrates the “problem”:  although the colorful endpapers show four different city models (Bridge Town, Hyperloop City, Steamworks, Upper Brick Side), the models and buildings all look very similar.  There are only so many different “looks” that you can achieve by combining the smaller LEGO elements.<br /><br />The book has complete instructions for eight different city models.  The ones not previously mentioned are Gilded City, Tomorrowland, Utopia, and Strange New Worlds.<br /><br />Basically, this book is helpful for LEGO fans who want to get started on building their own microscale architectural models (models along the lines of the official LEGO sets in the “Architecture” theme series).  It explains how to construct different types of tiny buildings (round, rectangular, or stacked skyscrapers, for instance), as well as how to create tiny but recognizable trains, ships, trees, statues, trees, etc.  There are also tips on how to solidly attach various components to the baseplate and other elements.<br /><br />Hardcore LEGO aficionados will enjoy looking through this well-done book.  However, it’s quite limited in scope, and of course you will end up buying bricks if you want to replicate the models shown in the book.",Positive
"As a fan of author Elly Griffiths’ “Ruth Galloway” series (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B003UV90G6 The Crossing Places]]) and “Magic Men” series (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B00QPIGTOM The Zig Zag Girl]], I expected to like THE STRANGER DIARIES.  Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment--the story is told from multiple viewpoints (central character Clare, Clare’s diaries, detective Harbinder, Clare’s daughter Georgia, the narrator of a Gothic short story), and the plot clues and developments are dribbled out ever so slowly.  Overall, the novel is a confusing mess that isn’t worth the effort of piecing it all together.<br /><br />In the novel, a teacher at a private girls' school (Ella) is murdered during half-term break.  Ella’s murder promotes the chief narrator and diarist (Clare) to Ella’s position of teaching older students.  During half-term, Clare is teaching a course that includes a Gothic short story (“The Stranger” by the fictional author R.M Holland).  Clare becomes a suspect in Ella’s murder and also in subsequent murders tied to a haunted room in the girls’ school.<br /><br />What is extremely mysterious, is that Clare keeps finding entries in her private diaries that appear to be written by the killer.  The problem is, how did the killer gain access?  The Gothic story is itself a mystery, and it is revealed in small segments (though the whole thing is available at the end of the book).  Clare’s daughter Georgia is placed in danger, as is the family dog (Herbert).  Throughout the novel, Clare’s stability and sanity is in doubt.<br /><br />The best thing about this novel is probably the Gothic short story (“The Stranger”), which truly captures the mood and language of a 19th century horror story.  (Even to the point of leaving plot threads unexplained and dangling.)<br /><br />None of the characters in the main plot of this novel captured my interest or made me want to know more about them.  My hope is that Griffiths will return soon to writing the sort of mystery novels that she does well, perhaps by starting a new series with a new character.",Negative
"ALMOST MIDNIGHT (MIKE BOWDITCH MYSTERIES) is the tenth entry in this entertaining series featuring Maine game warden Mike Bowditch (the first is [[ASIN:1250161657 The Poacher’s Son]]); it works fine as a standalone.  The author does a marvelous job of immersing the reader in the remote Maine woods scene.  The plot involves administrative corruption within a Maine prison (corruption that causes a few inmate deaths), but it mostly centers on Mike’s search for the person who shot--and probably mortally wounded--his escaped dog/wolf (Shadow) with a crossbow.<br /><br />In the novel, Mike’s incarcerated best friend (Billy Cronk) urgently summons him to the Maine State Prison, and asks him to investigate the new CO, a sergeant named Dawn Richie.  Mike barely gets started before Richie is ambushed and wounded in the prison laundry room.  The ambush leaves a prison guard dead, and lands two inmates (one is Billy) in the nearest hospital.  More mayhem ensues when one of the injured inmates gets loose and takes a nurse hostage.<br /><br />When the situation clears, Mike concentrates on identifying Shadow’s attacker.  This puts him in touch with a crazy North Woods distiller (Alcohol Mary), a newly established Amish enclave, a young couple dwelling in a yurt, and a wealthy, homicidal landowner (Gorman Peaslee) who is determined to eradicate the Amish.  Mike also touches base with many game warden friends, and pursues his relationship with Dani Tate.<br /><br />The novel illustrates the changes occuring in northern Maine (e.g., the local impact of the closing of a huge paper mill).  It paints a very detailed picture of the area, but it never, ever reads like a travelogue.  The characters are extremely well-developed.  The plot is interesting, though it is driven by Mike’s pursuit of Shadow’s attacker far more than by the murders of the humans, and the Shadow plot gets tiresome over the course of a full-length novel.  The action-packed conclusion is both exciting and satisfying.",Positive
"THE MISSING CORPSE: A BRITTANY MYSTERY lost me after only 22 pages, as those were mostly filled with fact-filled passages about (1) zoo penguin behavior, (2) the dying out of the lighthouse keeper’s profession, (3) the varieties of rain in Brittany, (4) the emergence of life from Brittany’s seawater, (5) the geography of the plateau between the estuaries of the mythical Aven and Belon rivers, and (6) the worldwide problem of sand theft from beaches.  All these boring mini-lectures are out of place in mystery/thriller escape fiction.<br /><br />It is true that a probable murder turns up on page 11, but when the main character (Commissaire Dupin) reaches the scene, there is no body, no blood, and no disturbance of the soil.  Worse yet, the person who reported seeing the body is an elderly, eccentric, former actress (Sophie Bandol) who “gets confused sometimes”.  So it appears that there is no murder, after all.<br /><br />Well, thanks to the book’s title, we know that old Sophie wasn’t confused.  However, the murder setup--a pristine crime scene with a missing body and detectives standing around wondering what to do--doesn’t grab me in the slightest.  It isn’t interesting enough to make me want to slog through more descriptions of penguins, sand theft, and local scenery.<br /><br />Commissaire Dupin himself is boring, because he’s depicted as deeply dissatisfied with a recent promotion that requires him to attend seminars on topics such as “Conducting Systematic and Systemic Conversations in Investigative Situations”.  The fact that Dupin grasps at any excuse for skipping out on the training programs  doesn’t save him.<br /><br />The translation of the novel seems particularly uninspired.  True Francophiles may enjoy the book, but the characters and local settings aren’t nearly as interesting as the ones in Martin Walker’s “Bruno, Chief of Police” series.",Negative
"DKFINDOUT! CODING is mostly a collection of factoids about early computers (e.g., Babbage’s Difference Engine), programmers and inventors (e.g., Steve Jobs, Bill Gates), elementary coding programs (e.g., Scratch), apps (e.g., smartphones in action), gaming (e.g., virtual reality), and the like.  It’s so elementary in scope, I wonder what age group would find this worth reading?<br /><br />This is probably the first DK book I’ve examined that I haven’t liked.  I’m an information junkie, but the presentation here is so shallow, there is very little actual knowledge imparted.<br /><br />I think the book is pretty useless for increasing a child’s programming know-how, as promised in the advertising.  For example, one of the items in the “Learning to code” section (a two-page spread) states:  “Be a robot master  Robot kits let you build a robot quite easily.  You can then tell the robot what to do by writing instructions in code.”  Does a child who is interested in coding need to be told this in a book?  Would this inspire a child who knows nothing about coding to want to learn to code?",Negative
"RUBIK doesn't’ read like a novel, but like a collection of “experimental” short stories--or, more accurately, like a collection of vignettes prepared for creative writing class assignments.  The stories make little sense to me, and leave me feeling sad and mildly depressed, so I didn't enjoy them.<br /><br />I’m baffled by the Amazon classification of author Elizabeth Tan’s book as “Humor: Satire”.  What's funny about the torment of an aging piano teacher that is triggered by a cellphone call that plays the opening notes of a piano piece the teacher memorized long ago?  How is the sudden death of a young woman, who is now remembered only by traces left on Internet message boards, either humorous or satirical?<br /><br />The Amazon classification of the book as “Fantasy:  Magical Realism” seems more reasonable.  Since I’ve never heard of a “Magical Realism” genre, and have no idea what it is supposed to be, it may explain why I don't understand the stories.<br /><br />The author does seem to have writing talent, though I don't care for her style.  It’s choppy and frequently disregards the usual rules of grammar.  It has a certain rhythm and flow that you get used to, as you read, but that doesn't make the prose “lyrical” or “beautiful”.<br /><br />Here's a brief example, a paragraph describing a doomed character leaving a gas station mini-mart:  “Elena, on the diagonal, outside and away from the white glow of diesel and LPG, the faint croon of the radio playing infinitely for refueling motorists.”  Or another example, a sentence that opens a chapter:  “Kish, unarticulated today, without bar lines, spine creaking like a hymn book; soft, old Kish, having dreamed last night of being an engulfed cathedral, ascending to consciousness in perfect fourths.”<br /><br />Perhaps there is a story to be found among the disconnected chapters.  However, although I like fantasy and science fiction generally, I’m too literal-minded to want to spend time trying to figure out a “novel” like this one.",Negative
"THE HYPNOTIST: A NOVEL (JOONA LINNA) is a new translation of the first novel in Lars Kepler’s internationally best-selling Joona Linna series.  (Lars Kepler is the pseudonym of a Swedish husband-and-wife writing team.)  Unfortunately, it isn’t a very good translation--the grammar is correct, but the sentences are short and choppy, and the simple, limited vocabulary makes for dull reading.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the story is told in short chapters (often labeled by the same day of the week and month) that recount the particular day's important happenings from different viewpoints (Erik, Simone, Joona).  The shifting viewpoints make sense, because the characters are operating independently, in different locations and contexts.  However, this novel structure is hard to pull off smoothly in a writer’s original language, and the format presents extra challenges for the translator.  Here, the translation seems to closely follow the words of the original, with the result that the story plods mechanically along.<br /><br />The story is set in motion when the obsessive Detective Joona takes over a case involving the bloody knife murders of a teacher, his wife, and his young daughter.  The teacher's son (Josef) is found covered in stab wounds, barely alive.  Joona persuades a medically-qualified hypnotist (Erik)--who has sworn, after a bad experience, to never hypnotize anyone again--to hypnotize the boy in order to save the life of the murdered family’s one remaining daughter (Evelyn).<br /><br />Hypnosis reveals a startling, unexpected result, and the story continues with myriad unexpected plot twists.  Erik’s marriage starts to fall apart; his hemophiliac son (Benjamin) is kidnapped; there's another murder by the killer of the teacher's family; various people’s faces are disfigured; a seriously disturbed, homicidal woman (Lydia) resurfaces from Erik’s past; and more.  There are multiple bloody or otherwise disturbing scenes, and the novel culminates with a wildly unbelievable series of rescues.<br /><br />The novel is fairly readable, and is capable of engaging the reader’s attention.  However, the characters lack depth; and the plot is overloaded with far too many twisty developments.  In the end, it’s a police procedural that's simply exhausting to read.",Negative
"When I order a book marketed as a mystery/thriller, I expect a relatively easy-to-read, entertaining book--a novel to be read for the story, and then given away or recycled.  What I do NOT want is a book with a plot that dribbles out information about what actually happened or is happening to the characters, or that makes the reader’s job difficult by jumping around in timelines, and/or shifting abruptly from one first-person viewpoint character to another.  Why should anyone bother to read a throwaway mass-market novel that transforms pleasure-reading into a demanding job?<br /><br />THIS IS HOW IT ENDS is one of the worst examples I’ve yet encountered of a mass-market “mystery/thriller” that (1) makes reading the story as difficult as possible for the unsuspecting reader/purchaser, and (2) delivers next to nothing as a reward for the reader's effort in tracking the jumbled-up events.<br /><br />This novel includes a couple of murders, and two female, angst-ridden, first-person  narrators (Ella, Molly).  Perhaps the following partial list of early chapter titles will serve to alert casual mystery/thriller readers as to what they are in for, if they want to attempt this book.<br /><br />Ella Now--6th March<br />Ella Then--6th March--evening<br />Molly Now--6th March<br />Ella Then--6th March<br />Molly Now--7th March<br />Ella Then-- 1st March<br />Molly Now--10th March<br />Ella Then--15th February<br /><br />The chapters go on in the same fashion, with skipping-around “Then” dates for Ella and forward-going “Now” dates for Molly.<br /><br />In my opinion, a novel writer has utterly failed at his/her basic storytelling task, when the reader must read the chapter labels to be able to tell which character is speaking, and the times when the plot events are happening.",Negative
"DON’T BELIEVE IT is a complicated mystery/thriller with a lot of “chapters” printed entirely in italics--which gives you some idea of what you as the reader are in for.  The basic storyline is that a woman (Grace), who was convicted of murdering her lover on Gros Piton in St. Lucia, Eastern Caribbean, contacts an old friend (Sidney) and asks her to create a TV documentary about the case.  Grace hopes that Sidney will uncover new evidence that will exonerate her and cause her release from prison.<br /><br />Sidney obliges, and the italicized chapters are summaries of the resulting individual TV episodes as they air.  Thus the novel is multi-layered, with retellings of the basic murder events that are nestled inside new accounts of ongoing events (including the public’s reaction to the TV episodes).<br /><br />The plot is twisty, with some unpleasant things in store for the helpful Sydney.  There are many abrupt shifts among characters (e.g., Grace, Sydney, Gus, etc.) and locales (St. Lucia, New York City, rehab hospitals, etc.).<br /><br />In the end, the revelation of the killer’s identity and true motivation, and of why/how the novel’s various murders were/are covered up, is unbelievable.  (“Family first” and “blood is thicker than water” are strong motivations, but a good murder mystery needs more.)  The novel ends with a cliffhanger of sorts.<br /><br /> As a regular reader of mass market mysteries, I find a novel that is constructed like this one to be too much work to be enjoyable.  It's not particularly entertaining, and it’s slow going.",Negative
"BROKEN PLACES (A CHICAGO MYSTERY) sets up an extremely hard-boiled female detective (Cass Raines) in a new series set in Chicago.  Unfortunately, the prose is too wordy for the “hard-boiled” notion to come off properly.  For me, Cass is just unsympathetic and unlikeable.  I like the idea of a black female investigator, but who needs another female detective who’s constantly reminding everyone of how tough she is?<br /><br />The plot didn’t grab me at all, because it’s partly driven by Cass’ intense personal dislike of an over-promoted Chicago cop named Farraday.  Sure, she hates Farraday with good reason--he got her shot in the line of duty, and is the reason she resigned from the Chicago police force.  But he appears far too often in this basically unbelievable police procedural plot.<br /><br />The slam-bang ending is way too long (30 pages?).  Worse, the prose is sprinkled with many trite turns of phrase of the sort you expect to see in classic hard-boiled-detective fiction (e.g., after being ordered to “Freeze!”, Cass tells the reader, “I made like a Popsicle, dropping the jacket, raising my hands over my head.  ‘Consider me frozen.’”)<br /><br />I generally love mystery/thrillers set in Chicago, but I’ve already seen too much of this “Chicago Mystery” series.",Negative
"When I ordered FIRST PERSON: A NOVEL, I thought that the book-publishing aspect sounded interesting, and that it was a mystery/thriller.  Whatever book list I found it on, it was badly misclassified, because it appears to be a serious attempt at writing literature.<br /><br />It’s a first-person narrative, written in long, rambling sentences.  There is minimal punctuation--for example, conversations are reported on without all the bother of including quotation marks. The story is something about a ghost writer who’s failing at extracting information for an upcoming memoir from an infamous con man.  In all honesty, the book makes as much sense to me as James Joyce’s [[ASIN:0394743121 Ulysses]].  I cannot make head nor tail of it.<br /><br />Neither the narrator nor the prose is interesting enough to justify the effort it would take for me to figure out this book--what it’s about, or what the author’s intentions were in writing it.  I leave this much-praised novel to all the students of English literature who particularly enjoy reading “difficult” novels with expansive, all-encompassing literary themes.",Negative
"PROVIDENCE: A NOVEL is professionally written, and it’s probably a decent novel, but it isn’t what I expect from a fantasy mystery/thriller.  It’s written as a first-person narrative, in chapters that cycle through three different viewpoint characters (Jon, Chloe, Eggs).  The chapters are further grouped into parts involving different times and locales (e.g., Four Years Later; Six Years Later; Lynn, Lynn, City of Sin, etc.), and there are big gaps in the basic timeline.<br /><br />This style of novel-writing leaves me cold.  It’s far too much work keeping the characters and story straight.  I also hate sifting through all the inner thoughts, insecurities, ditherings, and general angsts of multiple first-person narrators.<br /><br />With this book, I couldn’t suspend my disbelief regarding someone’s placing a kidnapped middle-school boy (not a very bright one) into a medically induced coma for four years, and then releasing him as a more powerful person. Nor could I believe in a deep, abiding, lifelong love established between two middle-school students.  Also, the opening paragraph really grated, with Jon’s statement that “I brung Pedro home for Thanksgiving break ….”  (Pedro is a classroom hamster.)<br /><br />I ordered this book because the publisher’s description promised a character endowed with unusual powers (after being kidnapped), and a detective that encounters a whodunit involving a serial killer.  I should have focused, instead, on the part of the publisher’s description that touts the author’s “keen and powerful observations about human connection and how love and identity can dangerously blur together,” because that’s what this book is really about.",Negative
"FRIEND REQUEST is yet another novel about something terrible that happened when the main character was in high school; that comes to light again years later; that causes serious trauma or detriment to the adult character.  In this example, the main character (Louise) did things that contributed to the death of a schoolmate (Maria) some 25 years earlier.  Louise is now a single, working mother of a young son (Henry), and she’s struggling to cope with daily life.  What she doesn’t need is a Facebook “friend request” from the long-dead Maria.<br /><br />The story is told in Louise’s first-person narrative, mostly in chapters alternating between things as they are now (2016) and things as they were then (1989).  It’s all about teenage relationships (cruel as only these can be), and toxic adult relationships (a high school reunion, domestic violence).  Through it all, Louise comes across consistently as fearful, ineffectual, insecure, and woefully eager to please.<br /><br />The plot moves slowly, through flashbacks, and when the mystery is finally revealed, it isn’t very satisfying. The writing is okay, but there are no likeable or particularly memorable characters.  The basic idea (what would you do if you received a “friend request” from a dead person) is intriguing, but the novel itself is extremely disappointing.",Negative
"CROSSINGS: A DOCTOR-SOLDIER’S STORY is a moving memoir by a courageous Army physician who completed no fewer than three combat-duty tours in Iraq during the Iraq War.  Returned to the U.S. for treatment of injuries suffered in Iraq, he suffered a stroke that ended his medical career forever.  Yet his memoir is devoid of self-pity, and squarely focuses on recounting the actual experiences of an Army combat physician, and on the realities of recovery from PTSD.<br /><br />For a civilian like myself, the book is hard to read, because of its honest descriptions of the combat physician’s job.  I think that medical students (especially those drawn to ER practice) and physicians who are about to become Army physicians will particularly benefit from reading this memoir.",Positive
"The only thing wrong with AFTER I’VE GONE is the lack of suspense--the plot is given away by the publisher’s teaser description.  To wit, a young woman (Jess) opens her Facebook timeline, only to read memorial tributes posted by her father and friends regarding her untimely death.  Only she can see the posts--eventually she realizes that they are dated 18 months in the future.<br /><br />The story progresses in a sort of dual fashion.  Jess’ life moves forward (she meets a man, marries him, and gives birth to his son).  The Facebook posts also move forward (providing details of when she died, of her funeral, and finally of how she died).  Jess’ story is an interesting story, about friendships and other loving relationships.  Importantly, it’s not burdened with a lot of angst.  Jess is paying attention to what’s going on in her life, and to the mysterious Facebook posts, but she is taking things one day at a time.  She doesn’t act on the posts until some sort of action becomes imperative.<br /><br />This is a well-written novel, with well-developed characters.  There’s no supernatural stuff, except for the future Facebook posts, and the story contains a valuable caution for young wives and still-dating women.",Positive
"CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS: A NOVEL is written in economical prose--not the kind that Hemingway produced, but the dull, uninteresting kind. Even worse, the plot is all about slow-developing, slow-moving relationships among characters that are neither memorable nor compelling.  And of course, as a debut novel, it’s written with a first-person narrator.<br /><br />I ordered this book because of the Dublin setting (which hardly matters) and the advertised “best book” selections by Vogue, Slate, Elle, etc.  I have no idea why this novel would make anyone’s “best book” list, or why anyone would say that it doesn’t read like a debut novel.",Negative
"GIRLS OF PAPER AND FIRE is a “JIMMY Patterson” book; it’s one of James Patterson’s line of books aimed at “young readers” (meaning, I guess, “young adults”).  It’s a fantasy/romance novel, obviously intended as the first entry in some sweeping saga (see the cliffhanger in the Epilogue).<br /><br />The fantasy setting is a world populated by three races/castes.  Pure humans are Paper, human/animal-demon mixtures are Steel, and pure demons are Moon; all of the castes are humanoid in form.  Paper is the lowest caste, though there are “noble” families at the top of the caste.<br /><br />The heroine is a Paper girl with unusual golden eyes, who is taken from her village (located in a kingdom ruled by demons) to become one of the Demon King’s concubines.  This is supposedly a high honor.  She lives in the Hidden Palace, but she’s still a concubine, expected to yield to the Demon King's physical demands.  She’s also confined to the Paper House portion of the palace grounds.  She rebels against the Demon King’s demands, and falls in love with another Paper girl, a high-born one.<br /><br />Personally, I found the novel confusing, what with all the strange rites and weird interactions between the human, part demon, and wholly demon characters.  I also cannot see why young female readers should want to read about or identify with concubines, even if they are rebellious concubines or concubines plotting their escapes.  (I seriously doubt that young male readers would be even remotely interested in this novel.)<br /><br />If young women love this book, then it’s fine with me--it’s their choice.  However, I would never recommend it to anyone.  In my opinion, a fantasy novel needs to do more than establish a complicated fantasy kingdom to be worth reading.",Negative
"The Gus Parker/Alex Mills series, which begins with [[ASIN:B01N22TFJ1 Desert Remains]], features Phoenix homicide detective Alex Mills, who unabashedly employs the services of psychic Gus Parker to help him solve tough cases.  Like the first series novel, this second one, DIG YOUR GRAVE, has an elaborately constructed plot with all the loose ends tied up at the conclusion.  However, the author seems to have attempted too much in DIG YOUR GRAVE, where the need to juggle two independent plotlines (the stalking of Gus; the finding of the killer who leaves murder victims in cemeteries) results in a book that's a slow, too-long read.<br /><br />In the novel, Alex is called to a shallow grave in a cemetery that contains the body of a well-dressed John Doe.  Alex summons Gus, who intuits that the solution to the crime lies in an investigation of long-ago events.  The body is soon identified as the billionaire CEO of a company that promises “a better YOU”. A few days later, a second body is discovered in another cemetery; this time it’s a plastic surgeon who drives a Maserati.  Alex sets his homicide team to work, and a lot of traditional, slogging inquiries begin to unravel possible connections between the men.  The hard-won facts are supplemented by more visions from Gus.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gus is experiencing disturbing visions that don’t seem related to Alex’s investigation.  He’s still involved in an idyllic relationship with popular singer Billie Welch, but the words “Stay Away From Her” keep popping up, in visions and in mysteriously-delivered notes.  And he keeps hearing Spanish music.  Will Gus succeed in sorting out his visions in time to stop a killer, and to save himself?<br /><br />The book is reasonably well-written, though the prose takes more attention from the reader than is optimal for a mystery/thriller intended for a mass audience.  The novel would benefit by slimming down from 410 to 330 or so pages; and from a rewritten conclusion that didn’t have to rely on a dry-as-dust FBI case summary to explain the killer’s motives.  Also, the details about how the murders were carried out aren’t convincing; the added plot centering on Trevor is unnecessary; and the business about the victims’ wives paying for the killer’s legal defense is just plain silly.<br /><br />Despite the flaws in DIG YOUR GRAVE, I found the novel to be entertaining, and I’m looking forward to the further adventures of Alex and Gus.  Both are interesting characters in their own right.",Positive
"THE ROBOTS OF GOTHAM has an interesting setting--a near future (2083) world populated by humans and sentient robots (some friendly to humans, most at war with humans).  The writing is superficially okay, but it’s sorely in need of editing.  The novel is 675 pages long!<br /><br />The wordiness makes the story confusing, and extremely slow-moving.  In the first 50 pages, there is a big human-robot battle (we aren’t told what’s behind it); the main character (Barry Simcoe) improbably survives a missile hit; he helps treat wounded soldiers and robots despite having no specific training for this; he avoids a firing squad; and he negotiates the repair of a robot (Nineteen Black Winter) that he’s befriended. This may sound like a lot of action, but the book is set in fairly small type, and there is a lot of meaningless back-and-forth conversation between Barry and the other characters in between those actual happenings.<br /><br />Also, Barry’s character lacks believable motivation for his actions.  For example, in the middle of the human-robot battle, himself in mortal danger, he tries to save the lives of two mortally wounded soldiers. Or, as another example, when asked why he’s offering $10,000 to save Nineteen Black Winter’s life, he says that he doesn’t want anyone else to die that day.<br /><br />Worst of all, the plot requires tracking an incredibly complicated political situation, and the story is told through Barry’s blog posts and through robot Thought Machine Paul the Pirate’s dispatches.  The political situation, as described by Paul:  “America is now permanently divided, including the Eastern seaboard and much of the Midwest, under foreign occupation. Under the terms of the Memphis Ceasefire the SCC formally withdrew, leaving the occupied zones administered by the AGRT, a peacekeeping force made up of volunteers from over thirty countries.  Manhattan has been annexed by a weird robot monarchy, while in Tennessee a more permanent peace is being delicately negotiated between the battered remnants of the US government and an envoy of implacable machines.”<br /><br />In case you didn’t quite get that, there is a US map at the beginning of the novel that shows the political boundaries.  There is also a 2-page chart of “The 2083 Sovereignty Matrix” that gives the names of the leaders of world nations and their classifications (human or machine).  Canada is left completely blank on the map, even though protagonist Barry is Canadian; the chart tells us that the Prime Minister is an elected machine.<br /><br />A novel like this is just too much work for me.  It may be the start of some sweeping saga that will eventually gain a huge following (like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones), but I’m going to wait for the movie or TV series.",Negative
"“Peculiar” is the word that comes to mind when describing A TALE OF TWO MURDERS (A DICKENS OF A CRIME).  The novel is another predictably bad example of the “avoid-having-to-imagine-your-own-character-by-choosing-a-historical-personage-for-your-protagonist” genre of mystery-thriller writing.<br /><br />In this novel, the detective is a young Charles Dickens, who goes around asking people questions--ever so politely and discreetly--in an effort to determine whether two recently deceased young women were poisoned, and if so, who poisoned them.  The unconvincing Charles Dickens constantly reminds us of his high regard for Miss Kate Hogarth, the daughter of George Hogarth, his publisher/employer.  (In life, Dickens married Kate, and she bore him 10 children, though he eventually  fell out of love with her and took a mistress.)<br /><br />At first it seems that author Heather Redmond has a good handle on the setting and atmosphere of London in the 1830s, but Dickens’ activities soon become repetitive and tedious.  Dickens attends parties, watches plays, dines frequently at the Hogarths’ home, follows up leads from newspaper clippings, interviews members of the nobility--but the descriptions are superficial and mechanical.  The reader is never immersed in the Dickensian time period.<br /><br />The plot winds up the complicated murder mystery in too few pages, and requires at least one certifiably crazy person to supply motives for the murders.  The ending is unsatisfying.  As an appendix, the novel includes a two-page Book Club Reading Guide, with 12 discussion topics, but I can’t imagine why any book club would want to select this novel.",Negative
"GROWN-UP ANGER:  THE CONNECTED MYSTERIES OF BOB DYLAN, WOODY GUTHRIE, AND THE CALUMET MASSACRE OF 1913 purports to be a “cultural study”, but it’s so personalized--starting with an opening (18-page) chapter about the author’s gut response (at age 13) to Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone”--that it reads like a memoir.  Starting from that remembered response, author Wolff embarks on an epic quest to discover the source of Dylan’s anger, and recounts all the details of his quest in this book.<br /><br />Wolff settles on the anger source as the “1913 Massacre” that Woody Guthrie sang about (because Dylan used Woody’s same melody in “Song to Woody”).  The massacre was a real event, in which 73 children of striking copper miners and 1 adult suffocated in a Calumet, Michigan meeting hall stairwell.  Someone opened the hall doors and yelled ”Fire!” (a false alarm), and then anti-strike men held the exit doors shut from the outside so that none could escape.<br /><br />However, to take this single event, and Guthrie’s song, as the source of the anger expressed by folk singers in the mid1960s (as “have-nots”, against the “haves”) is a stretch, to say the least.  If anything, author Wolff's “revisionist history” shows that you can always find apparent “connections” between things, if you try hard enough.  Wolff tells us (in chapter 1) that his four years spent at Harvard College were wasted on him, and I would agree.",Negative
"AFTER THE INTERNET isn’t really about what comes after a “broken” internet; rather, it’s a discussion of the internet so far, and how it has, or hasn’t, fulfilled its founders’ expectations.  The expectations are encapsulated in a 1996 statement by John Perry Barlow that envisioned the internet “as autonomous from control, surveillance, and manipulation”, and that “reflect(ed) an ideology that prioritize(d) individual liberty over the practices of the state or society.”<br /><br />The book’s chapters describe this “grassroots” internet's battles against powerful forces, which are “cultural institutions and telecommunications corporations that objectify and silence the voices of indigenous peoples (chapter 1); extra-judicial systems of policing (chapter 2); draconian Western-backed authoritarian regimes of the Middle East (chapter 3); and corporations and governments that exploit technology to support surveillance of internet users (chapter 4).”<br /><br />The book is readable, though academic in tone.  It’s primarily of interest to internet historians, system designers, and policy-setters.",Positive
"Author Zing Tsjeng’s background is in broadcast and online journalism (see the “Broadly.” Channel on Vice), which probably explains the weird typography in FORGOTTEN WOMEN: THE LEADERS.  Throughout the text, short factual passages (maybe you could call them “sound bites”) are printed in type that is far larger than the type used for the text as a whole.  Presumably this is done to make the best “points” stand out, but in a printed book, it’s like reading a book that someone else has heavily highlighted.  It just doesn’t work.<br /><br />The book also gives the impression that the mini-biographies are researched and compiled almost entirely from online sources, which may or may not be true.  (Certainly the Bibliography supports that notion.)  Online research is all well and good, but not as accurate or scholarly as one would like to see in a book meant to educate and inspire young adult readers.<br /><br />I love the concept of this book--short biographies of little-known women who made significant contributions to the politics of their times.  I also like the graphic illustrations very much.  But in the end, I wouldn’t choose this book as a gift for a young reader, female or male.<br /><br />The list of included women is useful for anyone interested in finding out more about “forgotten” female rebels, warriors, rulers, activists, and reformers (check the Table of Contents in “Look Inside This Book” for the list).  Apparently the list was created with help from Gina Luria Walker, Professor of Women’s Studies at the New School of New York City, and Director of The New Historia.",Negative
"The biggest mystery in A MEASURE OF DARKNESS: A NOVEL is what Jonathan Kellerman’s name is doing on the cover.  This novel is clearly written by Jesse Kellerman, with little help from his famous father, because the writing and plotting aren’t very good.  If Jonathan’s name weren’t there, the novel probably wouldn’t sell at all. (Oh wait—I guess that solves the mystery!)<br /><br />I was very disappointed by this novel, because I really loved the Detective Jacob Lev novels previously published by the father-son writing team (see [[ASIN:B00SI0B9MM The Golem of Paris]] and [[ASIN:B019L4N80E The Golem of Hollywood]]).  I suppose that part of the blame should go to the unambitious, working-stiff main character (Clay Edison), because his job with the coroner’s office sounds very dull indeed.<br /><br />In the novel, a loud, paid-admission party at a renovated Victorian house located in a poor but gentrifying Oakland neighborhood ends with a shootout and some dead and injured attendees.  Coroner-worker Clay is tasked with identifying a Jane Doe corpse found in the backyard storage shed, and with notifying the next-of-kin of a transvestite pedestrian who was run down by an attendee who was fleeing the gunfire.  (Apparently it’s the coroner’s job to do these identifications and notifications.)<br /><br />Tracing the victims’ backgrounds is a daunting task, but Clay is up to the challenge.  Among other things, his inquiries involve interviews with the head of a “safe house” for transsexuals and transvestites in Oakland, and with the head of a “free school” in a hidden, forested corner of Marin County.  Naturally Clay is in trouble all the time with his boss, because he spends too much time investigating.<br /><br />The descriptions of the San Francisco Bay Area locales are reasonably accurate.  The plot has various threads that get tied up in the end, but the storyline is boring.  The book Is a fast read because the writing is careless and simplistic.  One high point is a cameo appearance by Alex Delaware, father Jonathan’s famous psychiatrist/investigator, who pulls some strings to help Clay out.",Negative
"THE GUILTY DEAD (Monkeewrench #9) is a fast, enjoyable, relaxing read.  I’d call it a “cozy police procedural”, because it chronicles a complex murder/anti-terrorist investigation by Minnesota police and the Monkeewrench software team, but focuses on the characters’ comfortable, familiar, joking personal relationships.<br /><br />In the novel, an FBI agent (Dahl) approaches the Monkeewrench outfit (Harley, Grace, Annie, Roadrunner), seeking software to automate the interpretation of metadata (online chatter) intercepted from terrorist suspects.  Monkeewrench has just the ticket—a beta program in development, no current buyer—and the program immediately detects an imminent bomb threat against Minneapolis City Hall.<br /><br />The federal anti-terrorist operation turns out to be interwoven with a local police investigation by detectives Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth into the double murder of a wealthy local philanthropist (Norwood) and a freelance photographer (Stenson).  The murders are staged as a suicide and a hiking accident, but the police aren’t fooled for long.  A single bit of information supplied by Norwood’s daughter—the first name of Norwood’s personal private investigator—is the key that unlocks the whole case.  The killer’s motive is tied up with the long-ago murder of a pregnant 14-year-old girl.<br /><br />The plot is twisty and interesting, though it’s totally predictable that Monkeewrench’s very pregnant Grace will be delivering the baby (Magozzi is the father) in the middle of a major terrorist bombing attack.  The writing is good, the characters are well-developed, and the novel works fine as a standalone.",Positive
"WITH MY HANDS:  POEMS ABOUT MAKING THINGS is a pleasant, beautifully illustrated children’s picture book.  It has short poems about “making” and “being a maker”, as well as about individual crafts (e.g., soap carving,  building a cardboard spaceship, origami, baking cookies, etc.).  The poems emphasize making things that are uniquely one’s own, and describe the feelings associated with creative craft activity.<br /><br />The poems usually include rhyming elements, though they aren’t slavishly rhyming.  The metre is awkward in spots in many of the poems.  (I would like this book much more if it weren’t for the metre issues.)<br /><br />The poems about specific crafts vary in quality.  For example, I think that “Knitting” misses the mark. (It would be fine if it didn’t include the trite reference to “clicking-clacking” of needles.  My knitting needles don’t click, so I wonder whether the poet has tried knitting.)<br /><br />Overall, the book deserves good marks for encouraging creativity in young children.",Positive
"I liked author Julia Heaberlin’s previous novel, [[ASIN:0804178011 Black-Eyed Susans]], a lot, but didn’t care at all for PAPER GHOSTS: A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE. The basic premise—a young woman locates her sister’s probable killer, who is suffering from dementia, and obtains his release from a care home for a 10-day, 2-person auto trip across Texas, so she can extract his confession—is simply too bizarre and unbelievable.<br /><br />This is a first-person narrative, and if you don’t buy into the premise, then the strange young woman isn’t likeable enough to sustain interest in her curious machinations. She has designed little tests, involving photographs and objects (e.g., a scarf similar to a murder victim’s), that she hopes will reawaken the still-dangerous serial killer’s lost memories.  Their effectiveness is limited by the killer’s unexpected lucidity.  Has he been feigning his dementia?<br /><br />The parts of the narrative that describe the young woman’s sister, the sisters’ relationship, and the Branch Davidian debacle at Waco are poignant and well-done.  However, this doesn’t make up for the incredible plot premise, and the equally incredible, unsatisfying, surprise ending.",Negative
"The esoteric background and setting of THE WIDOWS OF MALABAR HILL—a novel about a Zoroastrian (Persian) family law firm that represents traditional Muslims practicing polygyny (multiple wives) and purdah (seclusion of women in their homes, behind the veil) in 1921 Bombay, India—simply defeated me. It seemed like every paragraph contained an unfamiliar religious, cultural, historical, legal, linguistic, or food term that required the author to take the time to define it.<br /><br />Also, I couldn’t really wrap my head around the actions of the female lead character (Purveen), who is modeled on the real Oxford-educated woman who was Bombay’s first female solicitor (in 1923).  Purveen seems to need an escort and/or her father’s permission to so much as cross the street (she is criticized for going to the nearby bakery by herself to speak to a vagrant).  Yet she takes it on herself, when working on a will, to investigate a suspicious request from a deceased client’s estate administrator, and then to fight for the rights of the deceased client’s widows who are signing away their mahr (promise of being taken care of if their husband dies).<br /><br />In addition to the difficult subject matter (for what is supposed to be a cozy historical mystery), the book is typeset in a way that makes it very difficult to read.  (Probably the lines are too long for the size of the type, or there isn’t enough leading between the lines.)  That is the book designer’s fault, not the author’s, but my eyes kept giving out as I struggled to pay close attention to the difficult text.  Author Sujata Massey, who has written a number of award-winning novels, deserved better treatment from the publisher.  But for all of the above reasons, I found this novel unreadable.",Negative
"A YEAR IN THE GARDEN:  365 INSPIRATIONAL GARDENS AND GARDENING TIPS is a gardener’s perpetual daily calendar (months and dates only, no days of the weeks or years) with beautiful full-color garden photos.  It’s very heavy (4 lbs. 8.8 oz.) for such a small hardcover book (8” x 8”), and somewhat clumsy to handle.<br /><br />Gardening enthusiasts will enjoy reading the “tips”, which are actually short, opinionated essays about garden topics rather than serious how-to advice.  For example, the June 1 entry says, in part:  “Rose archways not only provide support for the plants but are also eye-catching and can be used to partition space, if they’re the appropriate size, material and style for the garden. ...Choose as wide an arch as possible.  Roses bloom more abundantly when their tendrils are not vertical but are guided horizontally in gentle spirals. …”<br /><br />The accompanying photo for June 1 shows a lovely archway of light and dark pink roses that frames a rustic woven willow bench.  The pages all have some space allotted for the owner’s “Notes/Birthdays”.  The book also has a Table of Contents (in back) that identifies the subjects of the daily essays by date, so that the owner can use the book as a reference.",Positive
"It’s a mystery, why THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ADELE BEDEAU is subtitled “A Historical Thriller”.  It’s NOT historical (unless you consider a novel first published in 1982 to be “historical”), and it’s NOT a thriller (it’s slow-moving and extremely boring).  It’s not even an “unreliable narrator” mystery, because the narrators’ accounts are totally accurate (allowing for the fact that one character is paranoid).  What it is, is a psychological study of a loner personality (Manfred Baumann), and of the lasting effects of guilt (over a murder) on the two central characters (Baumann; and Georges Gorski, the policeman who’s investigating the disappearance).<br /><br />In the novel, a waitress disappears from a bistro in Saint-Louis (a backwater town on the Swiss-French border).  Gorski investigates, and interviews the bistro’s regulars (including Baumann).  This routine inquiry triggers paranoia in Baumann, who is a perpetual outsider.  He constantly observes the people around him without understanding or connecting with them; and the people respond with polite tolerance of Baumann’s presence.  Baumann becomes obsessed with maintaining his daily routine and the appearance of normalcy.<br /><br />In Gorski, the inquiry triggers guilt over a murder he investigated and “solved” many years earlier.  Gorski believes the convicted murderer was innocent.  Gorski also harbors guilt over his inability to make progress in solving the mystery of the waitress’ disappearance.<br /><br />About a third of the way into the novel, there is an unexpected revelation about Baumann, which explains his retreat from society.  However, the bulk of the novel records Baumann’s inner thoughts about appearances, and about his paranoid belief that Gorski is constantly watching him.<br /><br />The novel is well-written, but boring.  It’s okay as a literary mystery, but it’s a waste of time if you’re expecting a psychological thriller.",Negative
"A SEASON TO LIE: A DETECTIVE GEMMA MONROE MYSTERY reads more like a romance than a mystery.  The detective (Gemma) is a new mother--breastfeeding, of course--who must interrupt her active crime-scene investigations because her breasts are throbbing (it's time “to pump”).<br /><br />Gemma is also a highly insecure female investigator who starts to experience a panic attack when, during a blizzard, she discovers a murdered man “skewered” to a tree with an antique knife through his belly.  She finds relief when her male partner (Finn) joins up at the scene, wearing his “dark puffy parka and brimmed winter hat” that “were familiar, instantly grounding”.  Gemma adds, “he made me brave”.  Oh, please.  Gemma seems to be in the wrong profession--how on earth did she ever make detective?<br /><br />The whole story is told in first person, and it is generously padded with Gemma’s reflections on the surrounding scenery (the wind made tree “limbs dance and their few remaining leaves jump like marionettes”), and on the meaning of life and everything else (“I knew forces mightier than me were in charge, and those forces would dictate our next steps”).<br /><br />And what about the flawed police procedure?  To protect the evidence on the murder victim’s body (which is outdoors in a blizzard), Finn empties out a nearby trash receptacle to get the trash can liner and cover the body.  Trash is now gone, and who knows what has transferred to the body?<br /><br />Finally, the plot is a total snooze.  It's about the inexplicable murder of a world-famous, best-selling writer, and the ending is expected and trite. (Novels and TV series about writers are rarely successful, probably because writers do the interesting stuff inside their heads.)<br /><br />For escape reading, I prefer strongly-plotted mysteries that focus on the puzzle to be solved.  Mysteries (like this one) that feature detectives who share their innermost thoughts, conflicts, and feelings in far too much detail leave me cold.",Negative
"For a first mystery/thriller novel, RAGGED LAKE:  A FRANK YAKABUSKI MYSTERY is a heck of a good job.  It bogs down a little in the victim's journal (flashback) sections, but is otherwise a fast-moving story with interesting plot twists.  It’s refreshing to encounter a seasoned investigator (Yakabuski) who actually makes mistakes in reading the situation before him.<br /><br />In the novel, a Canadian cop (Yakabuski) rides a snowmobile to the remote far north to investigate a reported triple murder.  The victims are squatters (a traumatized Canadian Special Forces vet, a beautiful Cree woman, their toddler daughter) who had built a wackadoodle cabin with a beer-can roof at the edge of a remote lake.  They had no known enemies, and the crime scene yields no clues.<br /><br />Yakabuski and the two rookie cops (Downey and Buckham) who came north with him must lock down the Ragged Lake area for two days until a backup forensic team can get there by train.  There's little to be seen there besides a bar/hotel sheltering a tourist guide, a bartender who doesn't seem to belong, a cook who can't cook, some Sports (hunters), an excitable tree-marker (who found the bodies), and some local residents.  But when the nearby Survival School turns out to house men (biker gangsters) with guns, and a major storm hits, Yakabuski and his rookies have all they can handle, just to stay alive.<br /><br />All of the book’s locations are fictional, but the author brings to life the Northern Divide crime scene to such an extent that I felt the need to check it out online anyway (see “the Laurentian Divide”).  Yes, the story has a large body count (23 if memory serves), but most are bad guys, and there's no graphic torture in the killings.  Overall, this is a fairly standard thriller, but I liked the Yakabuski character, and will be happy to read the next book in the series.",Positive
"Who would have thought that a mystery based on mortgage fraud and idiotic corporate rules would be interesting and fun to read?  Yet that's what happens with THE SILENT SECOND: A CHUCK RESTIC MYSTERY.<br /><br />In the novel, human resources manager Chuck Restic has established himself in a safe, upper-corporate-management position that pays well and promises a comfortable retirement.  But his marriage is breaking up and he's got no life outside of work. So he decides to investigate the odd disappearance of a former employee (Ed) who had been a drab, unimaginative, totally reliable worker.  Chuck had met Ed briefly, when he handled an employee complaint about Ed’s bad cologne (which smelled like oranges and diesel fuel).<br /><br />Chuck discovers that Ed is/was an Armenian, and that Ed owned various rundown Los Angeles area properties that he couldn't have afforded on his corporate salary.  Ed’s “Deakins Building”, in particular, seems to be of interest to the local “Armenian Power” mob, the local zoning authority, a high-powered law firm that represents a fabulously wealthy local developer (Valenti), and some local, possibly crooked, cops.<br /><br /> As Chuck explores the mortgage-fraud world of the “silent second”--which is a secondary mortgage not disclosed to the original mortgage lender--he finds that many of the people who help him along wind up as dead bodies.  And Chuck himself is coming too darned close to getting killed himself.  But Chuck can't let go until he’s got answers to his questions:  Whatever happened to Ed, and why?  Is Ed dead, or not?<br /><br />This novel isn't a page-turner, but it has an intricate, believable plot, several memorable characters, and lots of humorous jabs at corporate politics.  It will teach you a lot about real estate deals, real estate politics, and real estate fraud--and it will do it painlessly, as you follow along with Chuck as Chuck “follows the money”.",Positive
"FLASHMOB: A NOVEL is the second entry in the “John Smith” series about a former CIA spy who reads minds.  Well, not exactly.  He “hears” other people's thoughts--the thoughts of everyone around him, from stressed-out nannies to politicians to arms dealers--and it's a burden, not a gift.  Just listening in gives JS headaches; and when he uses his other talent--inserting paralyzing, nightmare thoughts into bad guys’ minds--he pays the price later with unbearable migraines.<br /><br />In the novel, JS investigates a wealthy programmer (Aaric) who has designed social engineering software (corrupted by others into “Downvote”) that turns crowds into weapons for killing targeted celebrities and other people.  JS follows the software all the way to an exchange with Chinese military intelligence in the Laotian jungle.<br /><br />The ending has a couple of surprise twists, and a terrific, believable concluding action scene.  However, I liked [[ASIN:0062416413 Killfile]], the first series novel, better than this one.  FLASHMOB repeats the original concept without taking it much further, although this second book introduces a mysterious new character (Zhang, a Chinese spy with talents similar to JS’s), who will no doubt be complicating JS’s life in the near future.",Positive
"THE ROOM OF WHITE FIRE is a somewhat brutal and shocking, fast-reading PI procedural that is obviously inspired by accounts of the “interrogation” techniques (e.g., waterboarding) used by the CIA and the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib Prison during the war in Iraq.  These techniques were presumably based on the psychological research behind resistance-to-interrogation-and-torture training courses that are offered to agents and military personnel who are judged at risk of capture by enemy forces.<br /><br />In the novel, PI Roland Ford is hired by Arcadia, a private mental hospital (a prison, really), to track down an escaped patient (Clay Hickman).  Clay, an Iraq war veteran, was being treated for schizophrenia and/or severe post-traumatic-stress syndrome.  Roland soon learns that Clay was on a mission “to bring white fire to Deimos”.  But what is “white fire”?  And what or who is “Deimos”?<br /><br />Roland is intrigued by the number of persons who seem desperate to capture Clay (his wealthy parents, his treating psychologist, Arcadia’s chief of security, Arcadia’s founder/director).  As he follows Clay’s trail, Roland stumbles upon a fresh murder scene, and then the stakes go way up.  In the end, Roland needs help from the ragtag bunch that rents the six casitas on his Rancho de los Robles property, to narrowly avoid becoming a murder victim himself.<br /><br />The well-written novel ends with a scene that brings all the principal characters together for accountings and explanations--a scene that prematurely erupts into fast action with gunfire and fiery explosions.  The plot is well thought out and has lots of unpredictable twists.  Unfortunately, the characters’ problems are only partly resolved at the end, and this left me feeling unsatisfied with the novel as a whole.  Nevertheless, I’ll be wanting to read the next PI Roland Ford novel, if there should be one.",Positive
"I really enjoyed [[ASIN:B00LYXED0A The Honest Folk of Guadaloupe]] by this author, in which the story was told from multiple viewpoints, with flashbacks, and had to be pieced together by the reader. The description of Guadaloupe itself and its political/judicial system was beautifully done, and was part of the novel's appeal.<br /><br />The plot of THE SECOND DAY OF THE RENAISSANCE (INSPECTOR TROTTI) unfolds in a similar disjointed, obscure fashion, but it was too much for me this time.  I’m never fond of flashbacks, and the ones here were maddening.  When Trotti answers a summons from an old police friend, who warns Trotti that a contract killer is after him, the flashbacks come one after another, just piling up, as the friend is constantly interrupted and then doles out miniscule bits of information after each interruption.  Trotti keeps asking the friend to come to the point, but the friend insists on passing along his information in his own way, taking his own sweet time.  Like Trotti, the reader wishes that the friend would just get on with it.<br /><br />Even after I was well into the novel, I had no idea what Trotti had done to warrant being targeted by a hit man, or what all the various people and scenes described in Trotti’s flashbacks had to do with each other or the plot.  Trotti himself is an unattractive, depressing character.  The descriptions of Italy lacked the charm of the ones in &#34;Honest Folk&#34;, and weren't enough to salvage this novel.",Negative
"TEN DEAD COMEDIANS: A MURDER MYSTERY is a reworking of Agatha Christie’s very famous murder mystery, [[ASIN:0671552228 TEN LITTLE INDIANS (aka AND THEN THERE WERE NONE)]].  Ten comedians (some still actively performing, some wealthy, some retired, some washed up) are invited to a Caribbean island by a famous comedian, Dustin Walker, who was the inspiration--in different ways--for each man or woman's own comedy routine.<br /><br />When the comedians arrive, they find that Walker has committed suicide by hanging, and that the island is booby-trapped to ensure that none of them leave the island alive.  The plot is sustained by the reader's curiosity as to who will be the next victim, and how that victim will die, as the comedians are picked off one by one.  With each death, the victim's photo is removed from a “gallery” in the main house.<br /><br />The author attempts to differentiate the comedians by their respective styles (e.g., “We Need to Talk”, “That's Racist”, blogger critic), which are based on various well-known comics.  Unfortunately, the comic monologues fall flat--no surprise, really, because standup comedy and improv depend so much on timing and delivery.  The characters are extremely hard to tell apart when they're interacting with one another on the island and not trying to be funny.  (The exceptions are Steve Gordon and the Orange Baby Man, who are more completely fleshed out as individuals.)<br /><br />It's a tribute to the strength of Christie’s concept that I stuck with this murder mystery to the end.  But I only kept on reading to find out which character was the murderer behind the whole scheme, and which characters, if any, would survive.  Take away Christie's idea, and there is hardly anything left to use as the basis for recommending this novel.",Negative
"MURDER IN PLAIN ENGLISH:  FROM MANIFESTOS TO MEMES is a serious academic work, co-authored by a literary criminology professor and an anthropology professor.  The book is an examination of &#34;murder&#34; and murderers, using a &#34;literary criminology&#34; approach.  This approach is defined as &#34;the study of crime through the lens of literature and language&#34;; it is an approach that includes &#34;the study of half-baked literary attempts by the murderers themselves.&#34;<br /><br />The word &#34;half-baked&#34; clues the reader that this is an opinionated study.  Personally, I don't find the authors' analyses of the murderers' writings at all persuasive.  For example, in analyzing O.J. Simpson's &#34;suicide letter&#34; (from the time of the infamous &#34;slow speed chase&#34;), they see O.J.'s statement, &#34;First, everyone understand that I have nothing to do with Nicole's murder&#34;, as &#34;a weak denial or avoidance strategy&#34; that fails to &#34;assert that he did not kill Nicole&#34;.  To me, it seems to assert flatly that he did not kill Nicole--but the authors obviously read more into the words and context than I would.<br /><br />Another example of the authors' opinionated approach is their stated view that &#34;Jack the Ripper&#34; never existed--that he was a figure created by unscrupulous, slanted newspaper coverage that was designed purely to increase newspaper sales.  They explain their reasons for adopting this view, and they could be right--I'm not enough of  Ripper scholar to be able to evaluate it.<br /><br />This book amounts to an impressive catalog of murderers--the famous and the not so famous (not just Zodiac and Bundy, but also Hennard and Birnie).  The murderers are classified by general types (e.g., the family annihilator, the set-and-run killer), and also by psychopathic types (e.g., the spineless psychopath, the unprincipled psychopath).<br /><br />The book is probably assigned as a text in some of the authors' college courses.  I'm glad that I'm not required to study it closely, because it seems to me that the authors are imposing their preconceived ideas on the facts, instead of reasoning from facts to conclusions. Despite all the facts and analysis included in this book, at the end I didn't feel that I had any greater understanding of murder and murderers than when I started.",Negative
"SUCCULENTS: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO CHOOSING, DESIGNING, AND GROWING 200 EASY CARE PLANTS is a typical Sunset book, with the first 125 pages (of 288) devoted to &#34;Inspirations&#34;--photographs of mature succulent gardens located in the U.S. West.  The next 56 pages show &#34;Easy Projects&#34;--photographs and directions for using succulents in Christmas ornaments, table dressings, hair ornaments, bird houses, patio containers, and more.<br /><br />The next 64 pages are a catalog of &#34;My Favorite Plants&#34;--photographs of 203 easy-care succulents with a single-paragraph description of the plant and its growth behavior.  The final 22 pages contain &#34;Planting and Care&#34; information, and a good index (including both Latin and common names of the plants).  (See my customer photos for a sample 2-page spread from each main section.)<br /><br />This is a book filled with &#34;eye candy&#34; for lovers of succulent plants, and it contains a lot of useful information for succulent gardeners.  However, it is NOT the comprehensive individual plant reference book that I'd hoped for.  Still, it's probably a more complete guide for selection and growing of succulents than either my previous favorite references, [[ASIN:1604693932 Succulents Simplified]], or [[ASIN:0789416573 The Complete Book of Cacti & Succulents]].<br /><br />It's a useful book for gardeners like myself who are responding to the recent California drought (and the possibility of future droughts) by replacing traditional grass, ground cover, and ornamental plants with water-saving succulent gardens.",Positive
"A DIVIDED SPY (Thomas Kell series) is a workmanlike, plodding thriller that simply failed to grab my attention.  At the beginning, it commits the sin of kicking off the plot though an extraordinary, unbelievable coincidence--a former colleague (Mowbray) of  a disgruntled MI6 operative (Kell) happens to spot a married Russian spy (Minasian) in a gay relationship at a little-known vacation spot in Egypt, and also witnesses the couple's bitter breakup.<br /><br />Mowbray informs Kell, who wants Minasion badly, because Minasion previously ordered the murder of Kell's soulmate (Rachel).  Although Minasion (aka &#34;Dmitri&#34;) vanished into thin air after the breakup, Kell knows he can locate Dmitri through his spurned much-older lover, a Brussels architect (Reidle).  Kell effortlessly locates Reidle; immediately obtains an apartment in Reidle's exclusive, expensive building; and easily befriends the naive, malleable, brokenhearted Reidle after rescuing him from a staged mugging.<br /><br />And that's the point where I bailed.  Too many coincidences, too convenient a route to the Dmitri quarry, too many funds and thug resources available at short notice to a semi-retired British spy.  This novel is well-written, so it's okay for beach reading; but it's far too contrived to stand up to the tough competition for readers that exists in the crowded mystery/thriller genre.",Negative
"MRS. SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE TRUE STORY OF NEW YORK CITY'S GREATEST FEMALE DETECTIVE AND THE 1917 CASE THAT CAPTIVATED A NATION is a weird biography of a crusading female defense lawyer and talented investigator, Mrs. Grace Humiston (1869-1948). It's much more a &#34;true crime&#34; book than a biography.<br /><br />The book has an unfortunate split personality--for half the book, the details of Humiston's early legal career and cases (from 1905-1917) are recounted in narrative chunks that alternate with narrative chunks recounting the early, dead-end investigation of the Ruth Cruger case (1917). I kept wondering what the two narratives had to do with each other--until Humiston finally got involved with the disappearance of Cruger, and the rest of the narrative was able to proceed as a single story.<br /><br />Humiston sounds like a brilliant woman, but I don't think this biography does her justice.  It's a confusing, jumbled-up account of her life.  Even the &#34;epilogue&#34; and the &#34;author's note&#34; that attempt to tie up the loose ends of the real people's lives, and to explain why Humiston more or less disappeared from historical records, are confusing.  The book would be improved if more of the details uncovered by the author's admirable, extensive research were moved to the footnotes.",Negative
"THE RISE OF ATHENS:  THE STORY OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST CIVILIZATION is &#34;narrative history&#34; that attempts to relate the story of Athens as it was experienced by the ancient Athenians who lived through the actual events described in the book. Because Athenians believed that the stories told about Theseus and about the events of the Odyssey and Iliad were actually true, author Anthony Everitt's narrative incorporates these fictional accounts into this &#34;history&#34;, right along with the more factual accounts of important events in Athens' history that were described by ancient historians.<br /><br />The book is extremely readable, but it's &#34;dumbed down&#34; history that cannot be relied on by any serious student of the history of Athens.  Fact and fiction get hopelessly mixed up in a presentation like this.  I like this book for its entertainment value, as &#34;a rollicking good yarn&#34;, but not at all as a history book.  The ancient Athenians were fascinating people, so the book is worth reading for pleasure, or as a young person's introduction to Ancient Greece, but I can't see it as a serious work of history.",Positive
"THE NOWHERE MAN is the second &#34;Orphan X&#34; novel, and it's a high-octane, page-turning thriller.  However, it's extremely brutal.  The Nowhere Man (aka Orphan X, aka Evan Smoak) unselfishly helps ordinary people out of serious, life-threatening trouble, but in the end he's nothing more than a highly skilled, U.S. Government-trained, freelance assassin.  He has been taught to kill people, and that's what he does, over and over again, throughout the novel.<br /><br />In the novel, a teen-age girl calls the Nowhere Man for help when she is about to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery.  Evan responds and takes out the mastermind of the human trafficking operation.  But when he is cleaning up some loose ends, he is kidnapped, and then imprisoned in a remote, snowed-in chalet.  His captor (Rene) is a genteel but ruthless villain who wants the $27 million held in one of Evan's many concealed bank accounts.  In managing his escape, Evan leaves many, many, many bodies behind.<br /><br />The plot is reasonably interesting, but it's almost entirely driven by well-written, high-action, bloody fight scenes in which Evan dispatches guards and old enemies by working with minimal tools (e.g., a napkin ring, a trash bag), and by coming up with creative plans to gain just the slightest advantage over his captors.  I found this book entertaining--in a horrid fascination sort of way--but one &#34;Orphan X&#34; novel is definitely all that I ever want to read.",Positive

I mistakenly thought it was a popular science book about the latest research into how human brains work.",Negative
"Alex Delaware is NOT my favorite Jonathan Kellerman character, but Kellerman's mystery/thrillers never disappoint.  HEARTBREAK HOTEL has a cast of memorable characters (e.g., Thalia Mars, the centenarian former gun moll; Kurt DeGraw, the hotel manager; Ricki Sylvester, Thalia's estate manager).  The novel has an intricate plot, filled with twists and turns, and includes a final surprise at the very end.<br /><br />In the novel, Thalia contacts Dr. Delaware for advice about leaving her estate to a worthy hospital charity.  In the initial interview, she speaks cryptically about evil people, then schedules another appointment for the next day.  But when Delaware sees Thalia again, she is a murder victim.  Delaware and his good friend, homicide cop Milo Sturgis, follow out the leads generated by wealthy Thalia's convoluted finances, and eventually discover a murder motive rooted in a long-ago jewel heist, and in Thalia's pre-WWII love affair with an old-style gangster.",Positive
"I'm a big fan of mystery/thriller author Reed Farrel Coleman, but WHAT YOU BREAK (A GUS MURPHY NOVEL) was somewhat disappointing.  I love the &#34;Moe Prager&#34; series, but I don't care for the premise of the &#34;Gus Murphy&#34; series, where the investigator, a retired Long Island cop, has had his comfortable life &#34;blown apart&#34; by the sudden, tragic death of his son (John Jr.).  The death ended Gus's marriage, and left him incapacitated by grief.  Now Gus conducts private investigations--reluctantly, and only for friends--while he struggles--every single day--with moving on.<br /><br />This is the second &#34;Gus Murphy&#34; novel, and it works fine as a standalone.  (The first series novel, which I haven't read, is WHERE IT HURTS.  It may or may not give more details about John Jr.'s death, which apparently wasn't caused by anything that his father Gus did.)<br /><br />In WHAT YOU BREAK, Gus is still working as a courtesy van driver and bar bouncer for a second-rate Long Island Hotel.  As a favor to a close friend (Father Bill), he agrees to investigate the motive behind a confessed killer's murder of the granddaughter (Linh Trang) of a thoroughly evil businessman (Micah Spears).  Then, when Gus checks out a suspicious hotel guest, who is mysteriously connected with a coworker friend (Slava), he witnesses a murder carried out by a Russian mercenary.  The ruthless mercenary is after Slava (because of a heinous crime in Slava's past), and eventually the mercenary pursues Gus as well.<br /><br />The many threads of the interesting, intricate plot are handled well.  Gus's background is introduced seamlessly into the story, and Gus's crippling grief over his son's death is convincing and not particularly overdone.  Because I enjoyed the story, and liked Gus well enough, but didn't care for the underlying grieving-father premise, I rate WHAT YOU BREAK at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN is an extremely long (554 pages), slow-moving, literary mystery novel.  It's well-written, but it chronicles a 20-year-long murder investigation that basically ends nowhere.<br /><br />In the novel, a detective (Sasagaki) is called to a murder scene--a child has discovered the body of a pawnshop owner, stabbed to death, on an old sofa in an abandoned 7-story building.  The detective's initial investigation turns up information about the victim's final activities--including his withdrawing an extremely large sum of cash from a secret bank account.<br /><br />There are likely suspects (a young, attractive wife; a young male pawnshop manager; a probable mistress), but the case turns out to be a regular &#34;whodunit&#34;.  The bulk of the novel deals with the detective's continuing efforts to solve the case, and with the ongoing, intertwined lives of the victim's withdrawn 10-year-old son (Ryo), and the victim's mistress' precocious pre-teen daughter (Yukiho).<br /><br />What really annoys me about this novel, is that 10 pages from the end, the detective has a &#34;eureka moment&#34;--and then figures out the solution to the whole complex crime over the following 5 leisurely pages.  If this is a crime that can be explained in so few pages, then why has it taken the detective 20 years to solve it?  And why have I been reading about his efforts for the last 400-plus pages?<br /><br />Because my overall impression of UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN is that it's a waste of precious reading-for-entertainment time, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"Everyone knows, you can't go wrong with this, or any other, BETTY CROCKER COOKBOOK. The 12th edition subtitle is &#34;Everything You Need to Know to Cook from Scratch&#34;, and that is NOT an exaggeration.  There are timetables for cooking meats; food substitution charts (e.g., 1 c. buttermilk = 1 T. lemon juice or vinegar plus enough milk to make one cup); equivalent measurement charts (e.g., 3 tsp. = 1 T.); and recipes for everything under the sun.  There are plentiful mouthwatering, full-color photographs of ingredients and prepared recipes.<br /><br />In this &#34;hardcover&#34;, 5-ring binder, 12th edition, the recipes are divided up and separated by tabbed lightweight card stock pages with the following labels:  Getting Started; Appetizers; Beverages; Breakfast and Brunch; Salads & Salad Dressings; Soups, Stews & Chilies; Pasta & Pizzas; Whole Grains & Rice; Vegetables, Beans & Legumes; One-Dish Dinners; Beef, Pork & Lamb; Chicken & Turkey; Fish & Shellfish; Vegetarian; Grilling & Smoking; Do It Yourself; Sauces, Seasonings & Marinades; Breads; Cookies, Bars & Candies; Cakes & Cupcakes; Pies & Tarts; and Desserts & Fruits.<br /><br />&#34;Do It Yourself&#34; covers canning and preserving; &#34;Vegetarian&#34; discusses vegetarian diet and includes vegetarian recipes (e.g., &#34;Learn to prepare tofu&#34;).  The vegetable cooking charts are in the &#34;Vegetables, Beans & Legumes&#34; section.  In each new cookbook edition, the Betty Crocker editors update older recipes and replace older recipes with new ones, to reflect current food wisdom on what constitutes a healthy American diet (e.g., less sugar).  A word of warning:  If your Betty Crocker cookbook has a recipe you love, hang onto that cookbook--because the recipe may be gone from the next edition!<br /><br />This looseleaf version of the cookbook has good, tight binder rings, and pages that turn smoothly and lie flat.  However, the countertop footprint of the cookbook is large (10&#34; wide and 20&#34; long).  It consumes nearly 2 feet of counter space!  (Of course, individual recipe pages can be removed when they're being used.)  Also, the card stock that has the separator tabs is so flimsy, the tabs were already bent when my brand-new cookbook arrived.  My cookbook also has a lot of looseleaf pages that aren't cut at the bottom; they're easy to tear apart, but I shouldn't have to do this.  (I hope that this is an isolated problem affecting only a few copies like mine.)<br /><br />In fact, I much prefer the spiral bound BETTY CROCKER COOKBOOK, which is smaller and also has pages that lie flat.  Because of the large size, the too-easily-bent tabs, and the uncut looseleaf pages, I rate this &#34;hardcover&#34; 12th edition of the great BETTY CROCKER COOKBOOK at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Written by two school librarians, THE BIG BOOK OF MAKERSPACE PROJECTS:  INSPIRING MAKERS TO EXPERIMENT, CREATE, AND LEARN seems like an ideal book to add to any public &#34;makerspace&#34;.  (A &#34;makerspace&#34; is an area in a library or community center that is stocked with crafts supplies, computers, sewing machines, 3D printers, and other items that can be used for making, tinkering with, or inventing things.)<br /><br />The book includes complete, step-by-step, illustrated (with photographs) instructions for 51 projects, ranging from motorized cleaning-brush &#34;bot warriors&#34; to a &#34;Littlebits Sphero smart track&#34;.  Each project starts with a summary that gives the cost, the make time, and a list of supplies that includes where to obtain them (for example, an electric toothbrush can be found at Dollar Tree).<br /><br />The instructions include &#34;classroom tips&#34;, with suggestions for setting up group projects, or for what to teach to a group.  In the first &#34;bot warriors&#34; project, one classroom tip notes:  &#34;... it is good to teach ... about battery safety.  ... In the robots you are creating, ... electrons are used to power motors when the circuit is complete.  This means that you should never hook up the positive side of a battery to the negative side of a battery with an alligator clip because this will create a short circuit. ...&#34;<br /><br />The project instructions also include &#34;challenges&#34; for the makers.  These are questions that encourage learning through tinkering with the finished project. For example, in the &#34;bot warriors&#34; project, the first challenge question asks:  &#34;What happens if you mount two motors to your brush bot powered by one battery?  Now try two batteries.&#34;<br /><br />The projects teach concepts of physics, electricity, coding, and more.  However, the book would be improved if the projects had better general descriptions--at the beginning of each project--of what the maker is going to be making.  For example, the &#34;bot warriors&#34; project has no photograph of the assembled robot until the project is finished.  Even then, it's unclear what the cleaning-brush bot is supposed to do, until the maker sees that Project 2 has instructions for making a cardboard arena for brush bot battles.<br /><br />Clearer general project descriptions would help makers choose which projects interest them most.  Also, the book would be improved if there were photographs of the supplies (for example, a photograph of the &#34;alligator clip&#34; that consists of a pair of clips connected with an electrical wire).<br /><br />Because of the less-than-ideal project descriptions, and the missing photographs or drawings of supplies, I rate this otherwise excellent makerspace project book at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"CITY ON EDGE is a gimmicky sort of mystery/thriller.  The investigative team consists of a bunch of misfits--convicted criminals given &#34;get out of jail free&#34; cards so that their special skills can be applied to law enforcement, or socially challenged, psychologically damaged folks such as a former soldier with crippling PTSD.  This &#34;Vidocq&#34; team is led by a beautiful, wealthy, somewhat antisocial young woman (Evangeline &#34;Eve&#34; Rossi).  Eve is a clinical psychologist who is a former FBI profiler, a seasoned interrogator and hostage negotiator, a concert-level pianist, and a marathon runner.  What more could you ask for in a fictional female detective?<br /><br />In the novel, a 13-year-old girl (Allie) is kidnapped from the staging area of the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, on the day before the parade.  Allie is the daughter of the embattled New York City Police Commissioner, who is too busy &#34;protecting the city&#34; (e.g., dealing with threats to next day's parade) to spend any time looking for Allie.  Thus the hunt for the kidnapper is turned over to Eve and her crew.<br /><br />They set about digging up dirt on everyone connected to Allie, from her father to her chauffeur to her housekeeper--and there's a lot of dirt to be found.  For instance:  Did the Commissioner murder Allie's mother?  Why has Allie been using a credit card to make lingerie purchases?  Of course the crew is also operating under extreme time constraints.  The kidnapper has communicated that Allie will be killed unless the Commissioner and Eve's team accomplish three tasks before the parade comes to an end.<br /><br />CITY ON EDGE has a complex (albeit farfetched) plot, with lots of twists and turns. It's not a page-turner, but it's entertaining.  The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade setting is interesting, and the insider details (e.g., handling the ropes for the giant balloons) ring true.  The characters are all well-developed, and I came to like most of Eve's misfits.  Eve herself was a little too much for my taste--in addition to all of her resume skills, she effortlessly picks up new romantic interests, and always seems to have a guy and a spare, as well as a fiercely loyal all-male team that is eager to protect her.<br /><br />Little loose ends are left dangling here and there in the plot of this novel, although the important threads are satisfactorily tied up at the end.  I'm not tempted to read the previous &#34;Eve Rossi&#34; novel (THE HOSTAGE TAKER, first in the series), but the writing here is pretty good, and the story and characters will generally hold the reader's interest.  I rate CITY ON EDGE at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"In the Introduction to VERTICAL: THE CITY FROM SATELLITES TO BUNKERS, author Stephen Graham observes that shortage of land results in increasingly dense and stacked human societies.  Thus, he says, any understanding of contemporary cities requires looking at their &quot;vertical geographies&quot; (from skyscrapers' sub-basements to their empty antenna-filled crowns), not merely at their &quot;horizontal geographies&quot; (as represented by skyscrapers' footprints as seen on flat maps).  Today, political struggles over urban development are now increasingly shaped across both vertical and horizontal geographies of power.<br /><br />In the bulk of the book, Graham describes, at great length, the human and political aspects of the vertical strata of cities.  Satellites photograph the Earth's surface in astounding detail, causing political unrest in Bahrein when the impoverished majority sees the ruling majority's lavish homes on Google Earth.  Elevators shape interior building spaces as they evolve from cars placed within elevator shafts to exposed, glass-walled gondolas clinging to hotel lobby walls. Sewers hide &quot;the excretory nature underlying the city&quot;, and sewer construction must take into account special problems such as the solidified fat discharged by fast-food restaurants.<br /><br />The book contains a wealth of contemporary historical fact related to the &quot;strata&quot; of cities (from the effects of the bombing of Dresden to the depiction of sewers as monster-filled in horror films).  However, I struggled to find any real theme or argument to this book.  If the book is taken as purely descriptive of the vertical, three-dimensional characteristics of cities and their buildings, then the author's convoluted, academic prose makes for extremely tough going.<br /><br />Perhaps this is an important, must-read book for urban planners, and for political activists who oppose high-rise developments.  However, as a reader with only a casual interest in architecture and city planning, I rate the book at 2 stars (&quot;I don't like it&quot; on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"Failed Tibetan lama Tenzing &quot;Ten&quot; Norbut is a great private investigator, but his mystery series is NOT for everyone.  The novels are slow-paced, as Norbut constantly contemplates his inner equilibrium; and the novels always include some explanation of the teachings of Buddhism (smoothly incorporated into the story, but they're there).  A fun element of each novel is Ten's adoption (at the beginning) of a new Rule to live by--a Rule which he usually breaks almost immediately.  As Ten himself says in THE FIFTH RULE OF TEN:  &quot;That was the problem with setting a new intention:  it was invariably, immediately put to the test.&quot;<br /><br />The Tenzing Norbut novels work fine as standalones (the first one, of course, is THE FIRST RULE OF TEN).  This fifth novel is my least favorite, because it delves into the difficult-to-understand (for the Western mind) mysticism of the Kalachakra tradition in Tibetan Buddhism.  However, the reader doesn't need to understand the tradition to follow the complex plot, and the novel is a must-read for Ten fans because it contains so much of Ten's personal backstory.<br /><br />In the novel, Ten adopts a new intention to &quot;be mindful both making and keeping commitments that they be springboards to liberation, instead of suffering, for all sentient beings.&quot;  Ten is tested by a promise made to his autistic housekeeper Kim, and by his promise to marry girlfriend Julie (when he's feeling suffocated by their constant togetherness in their small living quarters).  There's hope for Ten, though, because his close friends, lamas Yeshe and Lobsang, have arrived in Los Angeles from Tibet for a fund-raising tour sponsored by Ten's local temple.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ten's attention is distracted from the tour.  He's pulled into the investigation of a missing person, after receiving a driver's license hand-delivered to his mailbox; and L.A. detective friend Bill is consulting him about a &quot;murder victim outline&quot; found in a local park--worthy of attention, even without a dead body, because it's painted in blood.  Also, Ten is having nightmares that finally drive him to seeking psychiatric treatment from his mentor Eric.<br /><br />Happily, Ten's cat Tank is still around, now coexisting peacefully with Julie's dog Homer.  As usual, the characters are well-developed and the plot has many complex twists and turns.  However, because the Kalachakra theme slows the story down (more than the Buddhist aspects usually do), I rate THE FIFTH RULE OF TEN at 4 stars (&quot;I like it&quot; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"In CLOSED CASKET:  THE NEW HERCULE POIROT MYSTERY, author Sophie Hannah does Hercule Poirot very well--almost as well as Agatha Christie herself.  But Christie died in 1976, so of course Christie did NOT share in the writing of this excellent (and apparently authorized) &#34;new Hercule Poirot mystery&#34;.<br /><br />It's too bad, I think, that the publisher (or Christie's literary estate) added Christie's well-known signature to the book's cover, and lists the book as &#34;by Sophie Hannah and Agatha Christie&#34;,  presumably as a marketing ploy.  In fact, author Hannah has invented her own quirky plot--for a murder carried out by &#34;the least likely person&#34;, per the Christie tradition--and thus she deserves the full byline.<br /><br />In this novel, a wealthy author (Lady Athelinda &#34;Athie&#34; Playford) of a children's mystery series (Shrimp Seddon and the Lady in the Suit, etc.) invites a group of guests (including famous private detective Hercule Poirot and Scotland Yard detective Edward Catchpool) to a weekend at her secluded estate (Lillieoak).  At dinner, Athie announces that she has changed her will to leave everything to her secretary (Joseph Scotcher), who is dying of kidney disease and thought to have only months to live.<br /><br />The news is not well received by her ineffectual son (Harry) and his wife (Dorro), or by her vicious-tongued daughter (Claudia), or even by Scotcher himself.  Athie's proclaimed motive for the bequest is unconvincing, and everyone speculates about her state of mind.  But son and daughter needn't have worried--their inheritance proves to be secure when Scotcher is murdered--apparently killed twice, in fact--and it's up to Catchpool and Poirot to unravel the puzzle.<br /><br />The plot has many unexpected twists and turns, and several quite memorable characters that are wholly invented by Hannah (e.g., nurse Sophie, the vainglorious Kimpton, Scotcher, Claudia, the almost-silent butler Hatton).  The book is probably a little too long, and it's certainly NOT a page-turner.  But the clues and conflicting bits of evidence fall neatly into place at the end, when Poirot gathers all of the guests together for one of his trademark &#34;reveals&#34;.  Because CLOSED CASKET does a very good job of writing in the Hercule Poirot tradition, I rate CLOSED CASKET at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"FRIENDLY FIRE (A JONATHAN GRAVE THRILLER) is a run-of-the-mill mass market thriller, but it’s perfect for summer reading.  The plot moves along quickly, the subplots are easy to keep straight, and the main characters (lawbreakers who kill not solely for money, but for a good cause) are intelligent and reasonably well developed.  This is my first “Jonathan Grave” thriller, but the eighth in the series (the first series book is [[ASIN:0786037075 No Mercy]]).  This one works fine as a standalone.<br /><br />In the novel, a Starbucks barista (Ethan) recognizes a customer as the monster who kidnapped and tortured him 11 years earlier, when he was only a child.  Ethan chases the customer and knifes him to death in a parking lot, before many witnesses.  Ethan tells authorities that he was kidnapped by the monster, and rescued by two men (“Scorpion” and “Big Guy”).  However, there is no record of the kidnapping.<br /><br />But Ethan isn’t lying.  In fact, Ethan’s rescue was performed by Jonathan’s Security Solutions team (consisting of Jonathan aka Scorpion; Big Guy; and Mother Hen, a woman with awesome hacking and electronic data collection skills).  All of the Security Solutions operations are strictly off the books, because Scorpion and Big Guy tend to leave a lot of bodies behind.  That was true in Jonathan’s just-completed successful “extraction”, the rescue of a congressman’s kidnapped daughter.<br /><br />That operation turns out to be connected to a U.S.-based terrorist group (the fictional al-Amin), which is not only hiring skilled professional kidnappers to snatch high-profile targets (e.g., children of senators and representatives), but is also plotting a major terrorist attack on U.S. soil.  Ethan’s monster/murder victim is one of the al-Amin kidnappers, so Jonathan’s team has a very slim chance of helping Ethan stay alive in prison and escape execution by lethal injection, by secretly confirming his unbelievable kidnapping story to the FBI and local police.<br /><br />The book is well-written, but formulaic. The plot is believable, and has a lot of interesting twists, but the good guys ultimately win out because they have the right government contacts and surveillance skills to be able to get the information they need just in time to take down the bad guys (while leaving lots of bodies).  There are a lot of practical details left out, many things skipped over, as the action of the story advances.<br /><br />Because it’s entertaining and a fast read (though not always a page-turner), I rate FRIENDLY FIRE at 4 stars (“I like it” on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"In DAMAGED (A ROSATO & DINUNZIO NOVEL), it’s obvious that author Lisa Scottoline has boned up on the law relating to child protective services, guardianship, and child custody.  Unfortunately, there’s so much law in this book, it seriously interferes with the reader’s enjoyment of the book as legal thriller fiction.  You can buy a law book if you want that much information.<br /><br />Even worse, family lawyer Mary DiNunzio is the most unbelievable lawyer I’ve ever encountered in mystery/thriller fiction. In real life, family lawyers who represent children encounter heartbreaking situations on a regular basis—and something that family lawyers do NOT do is begin proceedings to be themselves named a child-client’s guardian after the child’s only known relative dies unexpectedly.<br /><br />Mary’s falling in love with the child after meeting him only once makes the novel’s premise even crazier.  Mary’s only excuse is her “hormones”, because she happens to be planning her upcoming wedding to Anthony.  The wedding is only days away.<br /><br />DAMAGED is the fourth in the Rosato & DiNunzio series.  (The first novel in the series is [[ASIN:1250027659 Accused: A Rosato & DiNunzio Novel]]; the series itself is a continuation of the “Rosato and Associates” series.)  The novel works all right as a standalone, but despite the overabundance of legal instruction, it's mostly about relationships and wedding planning.  Because DAMAGED is such an unbelievable legal thriller, I rate it at a generous 2 stars (&#34;I don’t like it” on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"FIELD OF GRAVES is J.T. Ellison’s lightly-revised, previously-unpublished, first novel (and my very first J.T. Ellison novel).  FIELD OF GRAVES also happens to be the first “Taylor Jackson” novel; although, strictly speaking, the first published novel, [[ASIN:B00UFIH4X8 All the Pretty Girls]], is the real beginning of the series.  Some of the writing is awkward (especially at the beginning), but the plot drew me in, and I ended up enjoying the book.<br /><br />In the novel, the gorgeous Lieutenant Taylor Jackson leads an investigation into a series of baffling Nashville murders.  The body of a young woman is found posed on the steps of the Nashville Parthenon; the body of another young woman is pulled from the river near Riverfront Park; a priest and his student are burned to death in a confessional; a pregnant Vanderbilt student disappears and may be another victim.  Early in the investigation, medical examiner Samantha Owens (who has her own J.T. Ellison series) finds signs that the dead victims were all poisoned, and that they may have been sacrificed by a ritual killer.<br /><br />Taylor is recovering from having shot a fellow police officer to death.  She’s suffering from recurring nightmares that feature a field of graves.  Luckily, she joins forces with Dr. John Baldwin, an FBI profiler who has been severely damaged by losing three Behavioral Science teammates in a recent BSIS operation.  The two damaged detectives turn out to be just what the doctor ordered--for solving the case, and for each other.<br /><br />The amateurish parts of the book include the heavy use of Taylor’s nightmare dreams for characterization and filler, and the insertion of a poem authored by one of the perpetrator’s targets.  These passages exist mostly to show off the author’s creative writing skills, and aren’t really needed to advance the plot.  Also, Taylor works the investigation over several days without getting any meaningful sleep, and that sort of “superwoman” stuff strains my willing suspension of disbelief as a reader.<br /><br />However, despite the novice writer elements, the plot is highly intriguing and has lots of unexpected twists and turns.  Also, the characterization is pretty good.  I rate FIELD OF GRAVES at 4 stars (&#34;I like it on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"I AM NO ONE: A NOVEL tells the story of an ordinary man (Jeremy) who runs afoul of the ubiquitous present-day U.S. government surveillance of Its own citizens.<br /><br />Returned to the U.S. after spending 10 years in England, Jeremy is teaching German history at New York University. However, something about his data profile captures the interest of his governmental watchers, and sets in motion a series of events that only confuse and puzzle their  oh-so-ordinary subject (Jeremy).  Jeremy is in danger, but doesn't know it, let alone the &#34;why&#34; of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the entire 341-page novel is told in first-person (mostly stream-of-consciousness) narrative.  It's a real slog, because Jeremy IS so ordinary.  The message of the book (I think) is that a world without personal privacy isn't worth living in.<br /><br />In my opinion, that simple message isn't nearly enough to justify such a long book about a nobody.  (You can read the publisher's product page description for a pretty good capsule summary of the actual events in the novel.)  I rate this boring novel at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"BOAR ISLAND:  AN ANNA PIGEON NOVEL doesn't have a lot of Anna Pigeon in it.  It's mostly about Anna's close friend, disabled former rock climber Heath; Anna's goddaughter, Elizabeth; and a disaffected park ranger, Denise. I've read quite a few Anna Pigeon novels (though none recently). Compared to those, BOAR ISLAND seems short on the mystery-to-be-solved-by-Anna element.  It's mostly about relationships.  It also fails to provide the expected descriptions of Maine's Acadia National Park, because most of the action takes place on a private island that is located in the general vicinity of the Park.<br /><br />In the novel, Elizabeth is being attacked by a vicious cyberbully, who has totally ruined her high school reputation.  When Anna is temporarily assigned to Acadia, Heath and Elizabeth follow her to nearby Boar Island (owned by a hospitalized family friend), in order to get away from their home situation. Unfortunately, the cyberbully turns out to be a cyberstalker, and follows the pair to Maine. Thus Elizabeth's life is in real danger until the cyberstalker can be identified and arrested.<br /><br />Parallel to this main plot is Denise's story.  Park ranger Denise is consumed by hatred of her boss (an old friend of Anna's), who jilted her for his current wife (and baby).  But when Denise meets Paulette, a woman who is regularly abused by her lobsterman husband, her attention is turned elsewhere.  She and Paulette begin plotting the husband's murder.  Anna innocently gets entangled in their plans, and the two women begin plotting Anna's murder.<br /><br />The novel is well-written, and the Denise/Paulette story is reasonably interesting.  ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*****  However, in using the all-too-common mystery plot device where a heroine is placed in mortal danger at story's end to manufacture an exciting conclusion, the author allows her heroine to escape a certain-death situation in a wildly improbable fashion.  For this reason, and because the novel wasn't much of a mystery, I rate BOAR ISLAND at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).<br /><br />I recommend the early novels in the Anna Pigeon series, but not this one.",Negative
"AN INVISIBLE CLIENT, written by a successful Utah trial attorney, portrays practical trial strategy, tactics, and legal procedure so accurately that the book is almost a must-read for anyone planning to enter law school (especially for prospective criminal lawyers). It tells the story of a case involving an &#34;invisible client&#34;-- the name for a client with a winnable personal injury case that high-powered PI lawyers won't touch, because the client's lifetime expected earnings won't justify a big damages award at the end of the case. (To be &#34;visible&#34; a client needs an Ivy League education, a six-figure income, an inherited family family business, or the equivalent.)<br /><br />In the novel, a big-time PI lawyer (Noah Byron) decides to accept an invisible client (Joel Whiting).  Twelve-year-old Joel is hospitalized and dying, having been poisoned by tainted cold medicine that irreparably damaged his kidneys and other internal organs.  The manufacturer of the cold medicine (Pharma-K) claims the product was poisoned and replaced on store shelves by an unhinged serial killer.  When Noah accepts the case, he does so because he thinks Pharma-K's executives and lawyers are hiding something, NOT because of any strong desire to right the wrong done to Joel and his mother (Rebecca Whiting).<br /><br />The rest of the novel details how Nathan and his mega-firm's newest hire (Olivia Polley) gather the witness testimony and hard evidence they need to prove at trial that Pharma-K caused Joel's injuries.  Olivia is a whip-smart Brigham Young University Law grad, naive but pragmatic, and with a desire to work for ACLU-type causes.<br /><br />AN INVISIBLE CLIENT is a standard legal procedural novel, but it's well-written, well-plotted, and fast-reading.  Not only are the main characters well-developed, the author makes you care about them.  The novel is a great choice for summer vacation reading.  Because it's entertaining and accurate, but is fairly standard legal fiction, I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"DARK MATTER:  A NOVEL has a great concept--what might happen if a scientist invented a &#34;box&#34; that allowed him to physically interact with and explore the quantum superpositions applicable to his own life?  What would happen if the scientist were able to pick and choose among the alternative lives he would have led, had he made different choices at important turning points in his life (e.g., getting engaged or not, accepting a particular job or not).  What would happen if his &#34;box&#34; would actually allow him to go back and live inside a different life that now seems preferable to his present life?<br /><br />ASIDEM NOTE ON THE SCIENCE:  The concept is based on the theory of quantum superpositions, which posits that a quantum system such as an atom or photon &#34;can exist as a combination of multiple states corresponding to different possible outcomes&#34;, and that such a system remains in superposition until it interacts with or is observed by the external world, &#34;at which time the superposition collapses into one or another of the possible definite states&#34; (google &#34;Schroedinger's cat&#34; for the full discussion).<br /><br />DARK MATTER is a sort of &#34;parallel universes&#34; novel, but it's really an exploration of quantum superpositions.  The idea of the novel is terrific, but it's poorly executed.  The story is told through the inner thoughts and perceptions of the main character (Jason Dessen), a small-college physics professor who is inexplicably abducted from his happy family life and thrust into one of his possible alternative lives as a highly honored internationally known physicist and brilliant researcher.<br /><br />The novel just rambles along, documenting Jason's efforts to sort out all his confused thoughts and experiences, along with his efforts to find his way back to his original, idyllic life.  For me, the story didn't move very far from the basic idea, so that the plot entirely lacked in substance.  Jason's character is simplistic--he just wants to get home--and the characters of Daniela and Amanda aren't developed, either.  The novel never caused me to engage with, or care about, any of the characters.<br /><br />+++++++++SPOILER ALERT++++++++++++++<br />The ending seemed very contrived.  I have no idea whether the concept of many coexisting, competing Jasons makes sense in quantum theory, because I know very little about quantum theory.  As an ending, this idea was poorly prepared for, and didn't make a lot of sense.  It seems like the engineered life swap was doomed to failure from the outset, given that it apparently generated the multiple Jasons.<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />If you're interested in literary attempts to explore extremely basic principles of quantum physics, you may enjoy DARK MATTER.  However, because I found the novel boring, with a flawed plot, and not particularly well written, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"The author of MURDER.COM is a retired New York City lawyer.  The series title character (Reuben Frost) is a retired New York City lawyer.  Perhaps this explains what is wrong with this novel:  the author is a lawyer first, a storyteller second.<br /><br />The novel is literate, but the story doesn't flow because the language is stiff and formal.  At the beginning at least, the plot is simplistic.  Frost's detective friend Bautista tells him about his new murder case (a woman with a Ladbroke apartments address). Frost wishes Bautista luck, then goes to dinner at the Four Seasons with a former client (Courtland).  Courtland chooses the excellently presented Steak Tartare;  Frost goes for Maryland Crab Cakes.  Courtland then asks Frost to look into the very, very recent disappearance of his adult daughter (an editor who just moved into the Ladbroke apartments).  The two women's names are different, but  guess what?  The murder victim is the client's daughter!  So Frost and Bautista team up to solve the murder.  Except for the descriptions of characters' backgrounds and expensive NYC restaurant dinners, this is basically all that happens in the first 40 pages.<br /><br />The novel literally put me to sleep every time I picked it up.  I even started it over again from the beginning, to be fair, but I just couldn't get into it, and finally I gave up.  Because I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting, and the plot too thin and obvious to keep me reading, I rate MURDER.COM at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"THE DISNEY WAY: HARNESSING THE MANAGEMENT SECRETS OF DISNEY IN YOUR COMPANY (Third Edition) is an &#34;inspirational&#34; business management book.  It extracts a basic mantra (Dream Believe Dare Do) from a Walt Disney quote, then recounts Disney company anecdotes that supposedly illustrate how Walt himself used those guiding principles to manage and build his immensely successful family entertainment business.<br /><br />The basic Walt quote--&#34;as legend has it,&#34; the authors say--is: &#34;I dream, I test my dreams against my beliefs, I dare to take risks, and I execute my vision to make those dreams come true.&#34;  Stated that way, the ideas don't strike me as a specific formula for business success, nor do they provide any real explanation for Walt's individual success or for the Disney corporation's continued success.<br /><br />Likewise, an anecdote about how Walt ordered construction workers to test out new rides such as &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean&#34;--and ordered one man to keep riding until he figured out what it was that he sensed was wrong with it (no fireflies)--doesn't really fit into the mantra format.  (Maybe it illustrates Believe (in your ideas)?).  To me, it merely shows that Walt was a perfectionist who paid attention to detail, and could afford to indulge his perfectionism.  I think that Walt's success is primarily explained by his amazing artistic creativity, and by his clear understanding of what to put into family entertainment to give it the widest possible appeal--and these are things that cannot be taught in business management seminars.<br /><br />Probably each included anecdote is capable of inspiring an &#34;aha&#34; moment in someone.  However, the presentation--the forcing of disparate anecdotes into the Dream Believe Dare Do structure--severely detracts from the readability and enjoyment of the stories.  Also, the anecdotes and principles (e.g., &#34;never a customer, always a guest&#34;) seem very dated as examples of how to manage and develop a successful business.  For these reasons, I rate THE DISNEY WAY at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"A British historical mystery, inspired by the Russian spying operations in Cambridge in the 1930s, DIANA'S ALTAR takes some time to read.  It isn't exactly slow-moving,  but there's a lot of detail for the reader to absorb about the anti-Bolshevist political climate in England between the wars; the Oxford colleges and their traditions; the machinations of a fictional &#34;Hellfire Club&#34;; and the pre-WWI backgrounds of various aristocrats, politicians, and other fictional characters who figure importantly in the plot.  Fortunately, the basic puzzle (why did a Scotland Yard spy stab himself to death in a church pew AFTER completing his mission?) is sufficiently intriguing to keep the reader reading, wanting to know the answer.<br /><br />In the novel, a lady doctor (Adelaide) discovers a dying man with a knife in his chest, a self-confessed suicide, sitting in a church pew in Cambridge on Halloween night.  Adelaide notifies the authorities, and when the man's aristocratic identity becomes known, Joe Sandilands of Scotland Yard is called to Cambridge from London.  Adelaide, who is Joe's fiancée (sort of), informs him that this is the second possible murder she has witnessed this Halloween night.<br /><br />Joe, as head of Scotland Yard's Special Branch, has been ordered by higher-ups to deal with a &#34;national emergency&#34; that involves both the recent inexplicable suicides of several very important personages, and the possible leaking to Russia of atom-splitting secrets developed at Cambridge's famed Cavendish Laboratory.  The two deaths involving Adelaide seem to be part of the problem.  In the course of investigating them, Joe dines at the Trinity College High Table; masquerades as an amateur collector of Watteau paintings (with the help of beautiful feminist Dorothy Despond); uncovers a wide-reaching blackmail scheme that ensnares politicians, judges, and aristocrats; and meets with many important people (including the notorious Russian scientist Peter Kapitza).<br /><br />An unusual feature of DIANA'S ALTAR is that it has not one, but two well-prepared-for surprise endings.  It works as a standalone, but the reader will probably enjoy it more after reading at least one &#34;Joe Sandilands&#34; novel to get acquainted with the character.  (The series begins with [[ASIN:1616950021 The Last Kashmiri Rose]]).  I've read a lot of the series books, but knew nothing about Joe's romantic relationship with Adelaide, who is introduced in [[ASIN:1616956178 Enter Pale Death]], and now I must go read that book.<br /><br />There are a lot of interesting plot twists in DIANA'S ALTAR, and the characters are as well developed as they need to be.  (I particularly liked the new guy, Constable Risby).  However, the narrative is dense at times (at least for American readers), and there are a few too many lucky coincidences needed to advance Joe's investigations and the overall plot.  (To be sure, the coincidences are fairly well integrated and/or concealed.)  Perhaps a bit miserly, I rate  DIANA'S ALTAR at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).  It's a good addition to a fine series.",Positive
"BOYS AMONG MEN is a must-read for high school basketball players who are thinking of entering the NBA draft as soon as possible (one year removed from high school under the rule instituted in 2005).  By telling the stories of the trailblazing NBA stars who successfully skipped college basketball (e.g., Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant), author Jonathan Abrams makes it clear how hard it is for any athlete to make the transition directly from high school player to professional player.<br /><br />What the NBA prep-to-pro successes had in common was an incredible work ethic and devotion to improving their basketball skills, as well as coaches and teams that were committed to allowing their immature high-schoolers time to develop and to grow into their bodies.  What the NBA prep-to-pro failures had in common were raw basketball skills that suffered from lack of college coaching, too much money to spend, and too little personal development before their short-term contracts expired.<br /><br />The book is also a must-read for serious NBA history fans, because of the detailed accounts of the intense scouting and recruiting of the early prep-to-pro successes, and of the behind-the-scenes draft-pick talks among college and pro coaches, owners, managers, and players' agents.  (There is one particularly interesting to me segment on how Nike came to acquire Michael Jordan for the wildly successful &#34;Air Jordan&#34; line of shoes.)<br /><br />The book is surprisingly easy to read, considering the wealth of factual detail it contains (gathered from many, many firsthand interviews) about the prep-to-pro players, the history of the NBA, and the development of certain NBA franchises from about 1995 to the present day.  However, the text is often weighed down by the sheer quantity of names.  An enormous number of people were involved in the decision-making that swirled around the key NBA players featured in the book, and it's difficult to keep track of who all the people are, unless you're already familiar with a lot of NBA history.  For this reason, BOYS AMONG MEN isn't a good choice for a casual NBA fan like myself, and I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Because Jonathan Kellerman is such an accomplished storyteller, I always enjoy his books. However, child psychologist Alex Delaware isn't my favorite Kellerman character, because popular psychology doesn't interest me much.  In BREAKDOWN, Delaware spends most of his time investigating the circumstances surrounding a gorgeous young actress' mental breakdown and the disappearance of her gifted son.  For me, the book's best part comes near the end, when Delaware cleverly uses Google Earth photos to uncover a hidden location where some bodies might be buried; and also arranges for thermal imaging to probe the area for graves.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, Delaware learns that a homeless woman, Zelda Chase, has experienced a psychotic break, and is on 72-hour hold as the only patient in a semi-experimental boondoggle of a county facility.  Delaware is Zelda's psychotherapist of record, even though she was never his patient, because he evaluated her son (Ovid) years earlier,  as a favor to Zelda's now-deceased psychotherapist.  Delaware remembers both the beautiful Zelda and her talented son quite vividly, so he agrees to check in on her.<br /><br />Ovid is nowhere in evidence, and Delaware remembers the young Zelda as a loving mother who was totally dedicated to her child, so he embarks on a quest to find out what happened to Ovid.  Because Zelda is homeless and incoherent, Delaware relocates her to a suitable halfway house where she has resided before.  However, Zelda soon walks away.  After a short time, she is found dead in a rich woman's formal, manicured gardens--gardens that are miles from the halfway house.  At that point, Delaware's investigations broaden to include both Ovid's disappearance and the hows and whys of Zelda's death.<br /><br />This is an extremely well-written novel, and the plot has enough developments to keep the reader reading.  But it's not a page-turner, or a thriller.  There are some surprises, and there is good forensic stuff at the end.  Because it's a good story but kind of slow and unexciting, I rate it, maybe a little generously, at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"THE REVOLVING DOOR OF LIFE is my first &#34;44 Scotland Street&#34; novel, and the 10th novel in the series.  It's enjoyable as a standalone, because of Alexander McCall Smith's amazing skill at showcasing the foibles of ordinary people in a lighthearted way.<br /><br />How can a reader NOT laugh at a serious first-grade classroom discussion about whether one child's mother--who is &#34;a cow&#34; according to another child's father--got her &#34;cowness&#34; from the first child's maternal or paternal grandmother?  Alexander McCall Smith possesses a truly unique way of looking at life that always makes me smile.<br /><br />However, I found it hard to get into this novel, because of my unfamiliarity with the basic Scotland Street setting (Edinburgh's New Town) and the myriad characters (Matthew, Elspeth, Pat, Irene, Domenica, Angus, Bertie, Olive, etc.).  Because I much prefer the author's &#34;#1 Ladies Detective Agency&#34; series, and was not inspired to go back and read the earlier &#34;44 Scotland Street&#34; novels, I rate THE REVOLVING DOOR OF LIFE at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"FBI Special Agent Audra Bailey, the main character in POINT OF CONTROL, is another damaged female investigator.  She's a sociopath (defined by her inability to empathize with other people or to feel guilt about her own behavior).  But she's a &#34;good&#34; sociopath, not a criminal, because on the continuum of sociopaths, she doesn't take pleasure in hurting others.<br /><br />Bailey is in her ideal job, which she landed thanks to her superior IQ and analytical skills.  Lying comes easily to her, but she has to work hard at concealing her inability to relate to people in order to keep her job.  Often she must guess at what her superiors are actually ordering her to do.  She's failed at romantic relationships in the past, and has given up hope that she'll ever find &#34;the one&#34;.  She's also topologically-challenged, possessed of a very poor sense of direction or location.<br /><br />In the novel, Bailey is assigned to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearances, kidnappings, and murders of several scientific researchers who are experts in either metallurgy or digital encryption.  Bailey quickly figures out that the thread connecting the crimes is probably the cell phone industry.  There exists a severe shortage of cell phones, a shortage that is probably permanent because China has decided to stop exporting several rare earth metals that are essential to cell phone manufacturing.<br /><br />Bailey's investigation proceeds in a fairly straight line, not as a page turner, but not exactly plodding either.  There are enough characters and plot twists to keep the reader interested and entertained, and enough action scenes to satisfy the reader's expectations for a mystery/thriller novel.  Naturally Bailey finds that elusive love interest, an attractive man who triggers unexpectedly deep feelings in her, a man who is near the center of her highly dangerous investigation.  Most of the bad guys are identified fairly early, but there are still some surprises at the end of the story.<br /><br />POINT OF CONTROL is well-written and well-plotted, with well-developed characters.  However, because it didn't inspire me to want to read the next Audra Bailey novel, I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Patricia Cornwell is a terrific writer, a writer who really knows how to keep the reader turning the pages.  She also knows her forensics, which is why I've always kind of liked Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta.  However, the series has always been flawed by Scarpetta's being targeted for death by whatever serial killer she is currently investigating.  In this novel, it happens again.<br /><br />In DEPRAVED HEART, Scarpetta's incredibly evil archenemy, Carrie Grethen, is texting Scarpetta videos that were recorded 17 years earlier in her niece Lucy's FBI dorm room.  The videos implicate Lucy in a gun felony crime, and Scarpetta drops everything to try to protect Lucy.  The plot describes a convoluted conspiracy that involves Scarpetta's FBI-connected husband Benton and Lucy's partner Janet, as they try to thwart Grethen's easy manipulation of government databases that threatens to convert those databases to &#34;data fiction&#34;.  (&#34;Data fiction&#34; is data that has been falsified to present an untrue pictureof whatever the data is supposed to represent.)<br /><br />Most of the plot goes on inside Scarpetta's head, as she tries to make sense of the videos and of the behavior of her close family members.  There is a lot of filler that is pure description of the details of filthy-rich Lucy's private estate and its furnishings.  At the end, everything is wrapped up in a few pages, with loose ends left dangling, and with Scarpetta meekly accepting having been lied to by many different people.<br /><br />To me, Scarpetta comes across as a whiner and a paranoid, and the fantastical plot is wholly unbelieveable.  Although DEPRAVED HEART is well-written and mildly entertaining, with the usual forensics instruction, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale&#34;).",Negative
"WOMAN WITH A BLUE PENCIL is a tour de force, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  It's a kind of exploration of a literary conundrum.  To wit, what happens to a character that a novelist has brought to life, when the novelist decides to eliminate that character from the ongoing story?  Does the character continue on as before, even though he/she no longer has a place in the fictional world the novelist has created?<br /><br />In this novel, it's the day before Pearl Harbor, and a very ordinary guy (Sam Sumida) is devoting his entire existence to finding the person who murdered his beautiful wife (Kyoko).  But in the real world, Pearl Harbor happens, and Sam's creator, a Japanese American writer (Takumi Sato), is &#34;persuaded&#34; by his manipulative editor (Maxine Wakefield) to change his investigator's origins from Japanese to Korean, and to change his detective novel into a mass-market thriller.<br /><br />This has devastating consequences for the original character Sam, who suddenly finds himself in a world where there are no records of his existence.  Sam meets friends who don't recognize him, finds that his home is owned and occupied by a stranger, and learns that even the newspaper accounts of his wife's murder have disappeared.  But Sam doggedly continues on with his investigation.<br /><br />The book's story is told in a sequence of alternating chapters--first , a segment from the original novel (with Sam); second, a letter from the editor (Maxine) suggesting changes that will make the original novel more marketable; and third, a segment from the completed novel (with the new Korean protagonist, Jimmy Park) as it was actually published in 1945 under Takumi Sato's pseudonym, William Thorne.  The narratives in the two novels twist and twine around each other until they merge into one.<br /><br />It's an amazing performance, and the writing is excellent.  The author perfectly captures the tone of the overbearing editor (in her letters with &#34;suggestions&#34; that totally rewrite the novel).  Both versions of the story are fairly interesting in their own right.  However, I tired of the conceit fairly quickly, and ended up reading WOMAN WITH A BLUE PENCIL in a lot of short sessions.  Because it's a tour de force, but not altogether enjoyable as escape reading, I rate this novel at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale)",Positive
"A BLOSSOM OF BRIGHT LIGHT is a readable police procedural, but more &#34;literary&#34; than &#34;mystery&#34;.  The focus is on romantic relationships (Jimmy and Adele), and on the plight of vulnerable, undocumented Hispanic workers who risk unjust, family-destroying deportation (Manuel and his children) or sexual abuse by exploitive employers (a live-in nanny and several others).<br /><br />In this second Jimmy Vega mystery (the first is [[ASIN:149670228X Land of Careful Shadows]]), a newborn baby dies because Jimmy persuaded Adele to ignore a call from La Casa, her community help center, and to spend the night with him as they'd planned.  Neither Adele nor Jimmy are blameworthy--the call only reported that Zambo, a local crazy, had experienced another vision of the Virgin Mary in the woods behind La Casa--but Jimmy is obsessed with solving the mystery of the baby's identity.  The mystery deepens when the body of a teenager, who had just given birth, is discovered buried in the woods.  No one recognizes the girl, who had carried her baby to full term.<br /><br />Jimmy is taken off the case when his daughter Joy becomes the prime suspect in the two deaths.  Of course, he investigates anyway, risking his job and his working relationships with his partner and other cops.  Jimmy is distracted a little by concerns that Adele will accept a political candidate's offer of an important job in Washington, D.C., and leave Lake Holly altogether.  In the end, Jimmy wraps up the case in an action-packed finish that is interesting despite being rather unbelievable and contrived.<br /><br />The writing in this book is excellent, and its portrayal of the plight of undocumented immigrants rings true, especially the portions about deportation procedures.  Although most of the larger plot developments are predictable and easily guessed, there are many detailed plot twists that suffice to keep the reader reading.  However, because so much of the story is about relationships and the sadness surrounding the unnecessary death of a newborn baby,  I rate A BLOSSOM OF BRIGHT LIGHT at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"As author T.J. English observes in the Introduction, WHERE THE BODIES WERE BURIED is ""an account of the trial of Whitey Bulger from a particular point of view.""  That point of view is, basically, outrage against the government law enforcement system that recruited a notorious Boston mob boss like Bulger as a ""Top Echelon"" informant, and protected him from prosecution for many years, despite his ongoing criminal activities (including murders, sex with underage girls, drug trafficking, and racketeering).<br /><br />English ""attended every minute and every day of the trial,"" and recounts the daily events in detail, in chronological order.  Thus he successfully captures the tedium of every long criminal trial.  The author's desire to see the full scandal of the FBI's unfortunate involvement with Bulger ""laid bare"" is admirable, but the scandal itself isn't all that interesting if you haven't heard of Bulger and his crimes before picking up this book.<br /><br />WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED represents a lot of research (through interviews with witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and former federal agents), and is reasonably well-written.  However, as one more reporter's eyewitness account of a famous criminal trial, it's boring.  Those who are already familiar with the Boston gangster's crimes will probably find it more interesting than I did.  I rate it at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"It's a pity that the person who wrote the jacket blurb didn't write the entire book.  CLANDESTINE is nothing more than an awful, unreadable mess of a police procedural novel. The concept of a pair of detectives (one French, one German) working together to solve ordinary, run-of-the-mill crimes that occur in occupied France during World War II is highly intriguing, if you have any taste at all for historical detective fiction.  But this book's writing is so opaque, there is no pleasure to be gained from slogging through to try to locate the plot.<br /><br />As the story opens, St-Cyr and Kohler are arriving at a ruined monastery in the French countryside, where they've been summoned to investigate some bodies found near a banking company van.  There is a policeman awaiting them.  St-Cyr seems to have some kind of history with the policeman, but it's hard to figure out what that might be.  I guess you need to have read one or more of the previous 15 (!) books in this series.  There are two bodies, and the victims have been shot with antique firearms, apparently by two assailants.  The policeman who was first on the scene is lying to the investigators.  It is unclear what the victims' van was doing at the ruins, or why it was carrying smuggled contraband in addition to bank notes.<br /><br />The most immediate problem that I had with this book, is that you can't tell which character is speaking as you read the dialogue.  Similarly, when you encounter interior monologues instead of dialogue, you can't tell right away that you've gone inside a character's mind, and you can't tell which character is doing the thinking.  And it's very hard to tell from the detectives' back-and-forth banter which detective is in charge--the Frenchman? or the German?<br /><br />Then there's the fact that historical background is added with factual passages like this (recounting the German detective's thoughts while examining a murder victim's body for the first time at the monastery's ruins):  ""The pockets had been turned out and emptied, . . . everything . . . taken, even the small change that was so necessary now if one was to ride the metro, whose riders had gone from 2 million a day in the autumn of 1940 to nearly 4 million.""<br /><br />For a little while, I wondered whether this was simply a terrible translation.  But the author is Canadian, so presumably the book was originally written in English.  I ordered CLANDESTINE because it is supposedly part of a long-running series (!), and because Mysterious Press is the publisher.  But Mysterious Press really let me down this time. Because this novel is unreadable for pleasure, I rate it at 1 star (""I hate it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"THE BONE TREE is a well-written thriller, but it's a sequel to [[ASIN:B00FJ3AC10 Natchez Burning]], which I haven't read.  Evidently [[ASIN:B00FJ3AC10 Natchez Burning]] ended with a major cliffhanger, so this book starts out by dealing with the prior book's unresolved issues.<br /><br />After reading 50 pages, I still wasn't sure who the good guys and bad guys were, or why the good guys and bad guys wanted to kill one another.  There's a small-town mayor, journalist, doctor, and local police chief who are apparently on the same side, allied against a corrupt Louisiana state police organization that wants to do . . . what?  There is also an FBI investigator who must be a wild card--whether good guy or bad guy, I don't know.  At the time the book opens, a number of people have already been kidnapped, assassinated, euthanized, or burned up while opposing one side or the other.  Some of the likely good guys are on the run, some aren't.<br /><br />After scanning the remaining 752 pages, I threw in the towel.  The book seems to be a chronicle of various pursuits and narrow escapes and successful murders, with one side or the other temporarily gaining the upper hand.  Also, there's a lot about the involvement of the corrupt state police organization in the assassinations of JFK and RFK.  This is a plot that I cannot get interested in--and I simply lack the time to slog through such a long book when there's no entertainment value in it for me.<br /><br />No doubt those who read and enjoyed the very-well-reviewed [[ASIN:B00FJ3AC10 Natchez Burning]] will be eager to read THE BONE TREE to learn what happened next.  As for me, I have no plans to read [[ASIN:B00FJ3AC10 Natchez Burning]], even though I have already purchased a copy on the basis of its excellent reviews.  I already know that I don't care for the characters, or for the plot that centers on police corruption at the highest levels.  As a matter of personal preference in mystery/thriller novels, I rate THE BONE TREE at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"ALIBABA'S WORLD is a highly readable account of Porter Erisman's eight years (2000-2008) spent working with Alibaba founder Jack Ma, transforming a tiny Internet startup (a Chinese business-to-business web site) into the Alibaba of today (an e-commerce giant with a customer base three times the size of Amazon's).  Erisman gives Ma full credit for Alibaba's extraordinary success (achieved by Ma's dreaming large, controlling costs, and making risky business decisions such as challenging eBay's Chinese auction operations head on).  Still, the memoir is worth reading, because Erisman was there--a Chinese-speaking Westerner working as an Alibaba vice president handling corporate affairs and international marketing--during Alibaba's formative years.<br /><br />The chief weakness of the book is that the Alibaba insider account ends too soon--in 2008, when Erisman left the company.  Given the speed of present-day Internet commerce, that 7-year gap from 2008 to 2015 is enormous.  Today, as Erisman explains, &#34;The Alibaba Group . . . is a vast e-commerce conglomerate that connects buyers with sellers and enables them to do transactions across a wide range of products and services. . . . More than just a collection of related e-commerce businesses, Alibaba has become an ecosystem in which the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts because of the synergies among its elements.&#34;  (The main elements consist of wholesale marketplaces, retail marketplaces, and support services provided by ecosystem participants.) Increasingly, Alibaba &#34;provides the infrastructure for China's modern economy.&#34;<br /><br />To bring the book up to date, Erisman enhances his memoir with a chapter that describes Alibaba's current businesses, its position in the world economy, and the key challenges it faces.  As a business built (like Amazon) on a customer-first model, one of those challenges will be retaining customers within the Alibaba ecosystem.<br /><br />The book's concluding chapter, &#34;Alibaba and the Forty Lessons&#34;, lays out--in a sort of &#34;for Dummies&#34; format--many of the sound business principles on which Alibaba's phenomenal growth and success has been built.  A few examples:  &#34;Dream Big--Really Big&#34;; &#34;Never Overestimate Your Competitor&#34;; &#34;Be as Fast as a Rabbit But Patient as a Turtle&#34;; and &#34;It's More Important to Be Best Than First&#34;.<br /><br />Because most of the book is an anecdotal memoir that is entertaining and readable, but speaks rather generally about Alibaba as a business, I rate the book at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"No matter how hard I try, I cannot warm to this JUST TYPE 2015 WALL CALENDAR.  Printed on cream stock in just two colors (red and black), it's boring--definitely not the sort of ""eye candy"" you expect in a monthly wall calendar.  Hanging open on a wall, it displays each month's name in headline-sized type, and a series of odd-looking, mismatched date numbers.  (To see what the calendar will look like on your wall, click on the product-page photos to expand them and see the calendar's actual double-page appearance.)<br /><br />The date numbers appear to be mismatched because they are examples of the different  variations that are available for the typeface (e.g., Matrix Bold, Matrix Script Book, Matrix Inline Extra Bold, Matrix Regular, etc.).  I bought this calendar partly for the ""Big Grids"" promised by the subtitle, but in fact there isn't much space under each date  for writing in appointments or reminders.<br /><br />At the top of each month's display, there are a few comments on the history of the featured typeface (e.g., Matrix (for February) was the first typeface designed on a Mac).  There are further comments on relative heights and shapes of serifs, terminals, etc., to explain the features that distinguish the particular typeface from other typefaces. The 2015 calendar showcases the following twelve typefaces:  Akzidenz-Grotesque BQ; Matrix; Rockwell; Adobe Caslon; Snell Roundhand/Poppl-Residenz; Copperplate Gothic; ITC Century; Gill Sans; Dispatch; Bodoni; Bauhaus; and Trajan.<br /><br />As soon as I can find something else to hang in the wall space, this calendar is coming down.  The displays simply aren't interesting enough to look at for a month at a time over the course of an entire year.  I rate the JUST TYPE 2015 calendar at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"THE WHITES is a new mystery/thriller by novelist Richard Price (writing under the pen name Harry Brandt).  Not surprisingly, it's more literary than thriller--definitely not a page-turner--but it's always interesting, and comes across pretty well as a police procedural.  The characters are extremely well-drawn, well-motivated, and memorable--indeed, detective Milton Ramos is the stuff of nightmares.  The complex plot involving half a dozen major characters requires the reader to work a little, but there are plenty of horrendous crimes included to keep the reader reading.<br /><br />Back in the day, NYPD Night Watch detective Billy Graves was one of the Wild Geese--one of a batch of rookie cops who got good results by NOT sticking strictly to the rules.  Eventually the WG's were all promoted to detective, and eventually most of them moved on to new lives.  Redman ran a funeral parlor; Jimmy was an itinerant building supervisor; Yasmeen headed up a university division of crimes against students; Pavlicek was a rich realtor.  But the WGs still met for a monthly dinner, and each one was haunted by a personal ""White""--a criminal who had committed a horrendous crime on their watch, who had never been brought to justice.  The crimes had set up housekeeping in their lives--with Pavlicek forever stalking Jeffrey Bannion, Whelan forever pursuing Brian Tomassi, Redman forever watching Sweetpea Harris, Yasmeen forever tracking Eric Cortez, and Billy forever shackled to Curtis Taft.<br /><br />But when the White belonging to Pavlicek, Jeffrey Bannion, is stabbed in Penn Station and bleeds out while jumping a turnstile during Billy's Night Watch shift, Billy is pulled into an investigation of all of the Whites that ultimately tests his long-held, fierce WG loyalties.  In a secondary plot, Billy's family is stalked by a murderous, brutal psychopath with an ancient grudge against Billy's wife.<br /><br />As improbable as the plot description may sound, this mystery/ thriller actually works.  The novel is partly a police procedural, partly an exploration of workplace friendships and family relationships--and the pages abound with serpentine twists that all come out satisfactorily at the end.  Because THE WHITES is interesting, but more of a literary effort than a mystery/thriller, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Like the first book in this series ([[ASIN:0533164699 Splattered Blood]]), THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE DEAD departs from the usual mystery/thriller formula by featuring a crime-solving team instead of a single hero/heroine.  In this outing, Randy Larkin, Roseanne Kelly, and Graham Dunne have joined forces with a semi-retired private investigator (Pete Peterson) in order to acquire the supervised hours they need to qualify for their own private investigators' licenses.<br /><br />But they've hardly logged any supervised time before a baseball strike turns a rabid fan into a serial killer (the Vindicator) who targets baseball's biggest stars--the ""greediest"" players who earn the most outrageous salaries.  The killer blames the players for raising ticket prices so that genuine, ordinary baseball fans can no longer afford to attend games.  After the first murder--an All-Star player who has just signed with a new, higher-bidding team is electrocuted in a San Antonio hotel room--the FBI, local police, and the baseball commissioner are completely baffled.  So when the resourceful Roseanne offers the investigative team's services, pointing out that their firm specializes in sports-related crime and recently solved the Boston Celtics case, the commissioner hires them as ""fresh eyes"".<br /><br />If you're a long-time baseball fan, the story is particularly entertaining.  What true fan doesn't hate free agency and striking baseball players?  But most fans won't stay sympathetic to the Vindicator for long, because he targets good-guy baseball stars right along with the truly greedy ones who only play for money and what it will buy them.  The plot includes three well-designed murders that keep the story interesting, and everything hangs together well.  This series entry continues the development of Rosanne and Randy's relationship, and introduces their curmudgeonly, intriguing, slightly comical supervisor Pete.<br /><br />The novel isn't a rip-roaring  page-turner, but it's a fast, enjoyable read.  My only complaint is that Randy spends a little too much time reflecting on current events (in a way that doesn't really advance the plot) for my taste.  For that reason, I rate THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE DEAD at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"CYBER THREAT!: HOW TO MANAGE THE GROWING RISK OF CYBER ATTACKS is another of those business-school management books that is long on generalities (e.g., ""More and more we see sensitive information sited in environments that may or may not be secure"") and short on practical solutions (e.g., ""Make sure that any ISP that is going to become part of the enterprise is fully vetted."")<br /><br />The book contains absolutely no discussion of technical approaches to protecting a company from cyber attacks.  Indeed, when talking about responding to a real, very serious cyber breach, it advises the creation of ""a breach management investigation team"" consisting of representatives from general counsel, internal security, human resources, corporate communications, risk management, and other company or corporate departments.<br /><br />More than half of the book consists of disorganized, anecdotal examples of cyber threats (e.g., laptops containing sensitive data are stolen; social media is used to profile bank employees as part of phishing attacks; lots of people, nations, and companies steal information; the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has issued a damning report on China's telecommunications spying).  Does a high-level manager who wants to know how to protect his business from cyber threats need to be told at length about these well-known and widely reported occurrences?<br /><br />The Table of Contents is very promising:<br /><br />---Introduction:  What Every Current and Future Senior Executive Must Know about the Cyber Threat: A Perfect Digital Storm Is Forming<br />---Chapter 1: The Rise of Cyber Organized Crime and Its Global Impact<br />---Chapter 2:  The Emergence of the Cyber Nation-State and Technology Espionage: Red China Rising and Its Global Cyber Theft Strategy<br />---Chapter 3:  Cyber Al Quada Poses a Threat to Critical Infrastructure<br />---Chapter 4:  What Is the True Cost of a Cyber Attack?<br />---Chapter 5:  U.S. Cyber Public Policy:  Don't Rely on It to Protect the Brand<br />---Chapter 6:  Four Trends Driving Cyber Breaches and Increasing Corporate Risk:  Technological, Cultural, Economic, and Geopolitical Shifts<br />---Chapter 7:  Social Media and Digital Protest<br />---Chapter 8:  Managing the Brand When the Worst Occurs<br />---Chapter 9:  Managing the Big Risk:  Third-Party Vendors<br />---Chapter 10:  Creating Executive Cyber Risk Councils<br />---Chapter 11:  Early Warnings:  Something Bad Is on the Way<br /><br />Unfortunately, the text does not deliver on the promise of these chapter titles.  I rate CYBER THREAT! rather generously at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  If you're really interested in knowing about cyber-warfare's disturbing, growing threat to the U.S. government, the U.S economy, and the safety of U.S. citizens, you might consider [[ASIN:077043617X Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon]].",Negative
"The U.S. Government's ""Philippine Reservation"" was one of the most popular exhibits at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition.  It displayed some 1300 native Filipinos, taken from a dozen different tribes, with the intention of building popular support for the continuing U.S. occupation of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War.  The human exhibits of daily tribal living served to illustrate to the U.S. citizenry that Filipinos were innocents who were unready for self-government.  When the Exposition closed, the Filipinos were returned to their native land.<br /><br />A few years later, two impresarios (Truman Hunt and Richard Schneidewind) independently brought small groups of Filipinos from the Igorrote tribe to the U.S. to continue as human exhibits.  In Hunt's case, some of the Igorrotes were returnees from the St. Louis Exposition.  All of the Igorrotes came willingly, having been promised pay for their performances.  Schneidewind treated his Igorrotes well, setting them up in an authentic village that was clean and pleasant.  Schneidewind's exhibit also included informative lectures, so that it had a strong educational ethos.<br /><br />In contrast, Hunt set his Igorrotes up in Luna Park (on Coney Island) and forced them to build fake structures (e.g., a ""medicine man's hut"" on stilts), to prepare daily ""dog meat"" feasts (even though the Igorrotes held such feasts only on special occasions such as weddings), and to stage a pro forma ""native wedding"" to draw in curious crowds.  Hunt made up many stories about the Igorrotes' customs for publicity purposes (although it was true that the Igorrotes were head-hunters, and normally wore little clothing).  After Hunt landed in considerable legal trouble (beginning with an accusation of a bigamous marriage), he went on the run with some of his Igorrotes and produced a traveling show.  Eventually the Igorrotes sued Hunt for taking their money, and a lengthy trial ensued.<br /><br />THE LOST TRIBE OF CONEY ISLAND tells the full story of Hunt's exhibition and involvement with the Igorottes--from Hunt's selection of Igorottes in the Philippines,  to his initial wild success at Luna Park, to the impact of his legal problems on the exhibit, to his final total loss of the Igorrotes' trust, to the messy conclusion of the Igorrotes' lawsuit against Hunt.<br /><br />The narrative itself is immensely bloated, filled with the author's speculations about the participants' thoughts and feelings at every stage of their disastrous experience.  For example, the opening of Chapter 3, ""The Journey from the Tropics"", about the group's trip from the Philippines to the U.S. on the steamship RMS Empress of China:  ""The tribespeople bent their heads back as far as they could, but still they couldn't see the tops of her funnels.  Tainan felt a fluttering sensation in his stomach.  With wide eyes, he jumped up, as if hoping the few extra inches would help him take in the ship's full splendor. . . . Daipan wished her father were there to witness the incredible sight before them.  The RMS Empress of China was a huge, hulking beauty . . . .""<br /><br />To my mind, Hunt's exploitation story is a story that isn't worth retelling--certainly not in a 338-page narrative (exclusive of footnotes).  I rate this book at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"""Recycled"" is the best way to describe HEIRLOOM KNITTING SKILLS.  The knitting history is superficial, and most, if not all, of the photos have been published elsewhere.  The stitch treasuries are poorly printed (the textured and lace stitches in dark blue and dark purple lose all their detail), and the stitch patterns (a patchy, limited selection) have mostly been published elsewhere.  The project patterns are few in number, and are modern designs that merely use well-known ""heirloom"" stitches.<br /><br />Also, the project designs are not particularly inspired.  The projects are a basic square tote bag, a textured hot water bottle cover, house slippers, a beret, a twisted-stitch cowl, a baby blanket, a cabled cushion cover, a cabled cardigan, lacy-cuffed socks, a Hap shawl, a Fair Isle child's sweater (one band of Fair Isle across the chest), and Norwegian mittens.  The knitting techniques section includes how-to photos, but the photos are far too small to be of much use to knitters who are unfamiliar with the ""heirloom"" techniques (e.g., purl two together, Fair Isle stranding).<br /><br />If you're interested in knitting history, a good place to start is the excellent [[ASIN:1931499373 A History of Hand Knitting]], or [[ASIN:B00DLYULF6 Patterns for Guernseys, Jerseys & Arans]] (for cable and textured fishermen's knits).  For stitch treasuries, it's hard to beat the Walker books (e.g., [[ASIN:0942018168 A Treasury of Knitting Patterns]]), the Harmony Guides (e.g., [[ASIN:B0028HI262 The Harmony Guide to Knitting Stitches]]), [[ASIN:1898852758 Heirloom Knitting]] (for lace), or [[ASIN:3900493146 Uberlieferte Strickmuster Aus Dem Steirischen Ennstal]] (for twisted stitches).  Because HEIRLOOM KNITTING SKILLS is a poorly printed knitting book with a patchy selection of stitch patterns and ho-hum project designs, I rate it at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"WHAT STRANGE CREATURES was my first Emily Arsenault mystery.  I enjoyed it, but was not particularly inspired to order the earlier ones (standalone literary mysteries, e.g., [[ASIN:0062103105 Miss Me When I'm Gone]]).  Oddly, I did end up ordering [[ASIN:B002RI97XO The Book of Margery Kempe ]], because Arsenault's perpetual student/amateur detective Theresa Battle makes ""Marge"" sound like an interesting gal.  (Also, I've always kind of liked reading about medieval times.)  Serious college students and academics will appreciate Theresa's situation--being a seven-year Ph.D. candidate, stalled on her doctoral thesis (on Margery Kempe).<br /><br />The book's title is taken from Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK:  ""What strange creatures brothers are!""  Theresa is very close to her brother Jeff, an alcoholic, gentle soul, who is unemployed because he kicked a kid off his school bus for making fun of an overweight girl.  Things had been looking up for Jeff--he had a new, serious girlfriend, Kim--but then Kim is murdered and Jeff is arrested for the crime.<br /><br />Theresa has no choice but to do ""whatever it takes"" to investigate, find the real killer, and clear Jeff's name.  It doesn't help that Jeff suffered a blackout during the critical hours, or that some bloody evidence is found in his possession.  Theresa, a divorcee, doesn't mind sleeping with a hunky man (who keeps a full-grown python as a pet), if that's what it takes to find Kim's critical video files on the man's computers.  Theresa shows a remarkable ability to lie convincingly, as she interviews Kim's friends without revealing (most of the time) her relationship to Kim's accused murderer.<br /><br />Theresa's cats and dogs are charming characters.  Wayne, Kim's ""puggle"" (a cross between a pug and a beagle), actually helps Theresa with the investigation.  The book is extremely literate and well-written, and the plot has plenty of fun twists and turns.  I never guessed the identity of Kim's killer--at least not until quite near the end--and the ending itself is satisfying.  The whole story is upbeat, with a lot of subtle humor.  But for me the book wasn't a page-turner, so I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Lizzy Gardner is another of the new crop of psychologically-damaged female investigators that are perhaps inspired by the success of the [[ASIN:B00452V49A Mallory]] and [[ASIN:0307949486 Lisbeth Salander]] mystery series.  Lizzy's particular ""issue"" is that she's paranoid about personal safety--understandably enough, since she was kidnapped and held captive for some months by serial killer Spyderman when she was a mere teenager (see [[ASIN:1612185096 Abducted (The Lizzy Gardner Series #1)]]).<br /><br />In A DARK MIND, private investigator Lizzy and her detective boyfriend Jared run afoul of another serial killer--the ""Lovebird Killer"" (LK), who delights in surveilling couples who are unusually devoted to each other, and then capturing, torturing, and killing one or both ""lovebirds"".  Lizzy comes to LK's attention because she was hired by two of his victims to investigate a dubious workman's compensation claim by one of their former employees.  Jared is actually assigned to a task force that is investigating LK's crimes and attempting to apprehend him.<br /><br />Much of the book's actual investigating is carried out by Lizzy's assistant Jessica (who spots suspicious garbage bag activity at a construction site she is assigned to watch), and by Lizzy's troubled teenaged helper Hayley (who has been released from jail with a GPS anklet that is supposed to confine her to Lizzy's home, but who doesn't let that stop her from seeking to protect her mother from an abusive boyfriend).  Because there are three different investigative plot lines (Lizzy, Jessica, Hayley) that constantly shift their California locations (Sacramento, Davis, Antelope, Granite Bay, etc.), I found the story quite hard to follow.<br /><br />Chapters begin with quotes from real-life serial killers (David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, John Christie, etc.) that sort of talk about these famous killers' motives.  The story itself is developed through alternating short segments that recount the ongoing progress of the different investigations.  The segments are headed by generic place and time labels (e.g., ""Sacramento, Thursday, May 10, 2012"", or ""Davis, Friday, May 11, 2012"").  I have no idea what purpose is served by the famous-killer quotes, and the generic labels didn't help me at all to sort out when and where things were happening in the investigations.  The labels were simply confusing.<br /><br />For my taste, LK's gruesome torture crimes are described in far too much loving detail.  Also, I disliked the conclusions to the three investigations--none were particularly believable, one had echoes of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", and one left a character that I'd come to like a lot in a very bad place.  I rate A DARK MIND at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"***SPOILER ALERT:  There are many, many plot events that are NOT mentioned in this review; however it is necessary to discuss the book's structure, general plot, and some plot elements that are revealed early in the book to be able to write a meaningful review.***<br /><br />BIRD BOX essentially tells the story of a blindfolded woman's struggle to row a boat--a boat carrying herself and two small children--to a riverside sanctuary.  Blindfolds for the woman and children are essential, because there are creatures roaming the riverbanks that cause all humans who see them to go completely mad.<br /><br />Any human who sees a creature--directly or in a videotape--will first attack other humans and then commit suicide.  The creatures are never described, there is no explanation of their origin, and nothing is said about how they survive.  Apparently the creatures do not physically harm humans, because the bodies of humans who die from seeing the creatures are left to rot.<br /><br />In flashback chapters that alternate with the rowboat chapters, the book tells the story of how the woman (Malorie) came to be in her present situation.  When the creatures arrived in her city, she and a few others took refuge in a house, covered the windows with black drapes, and made sure that no creature or already-mad-human entered the house.  Whenever they ventured outdoors for water and supplies, the survivors wore blindfolds.  They rigged a ""bird box"" of caged birds that cooed whenever any creature approached the house.  The survivors also developed mildly complicated relationships within their confined existence.  Probably the most interesting part of the survivors' story is the scene about how the madness finally entered the house and destroyed most of the occupants.<br /><br />In my opinion, the author's failure to create believable, frightening creatures is responsible for causing this entire novel to fail.  More than anything else, BIRD BOX reminds me of the low-budget science fiction movies where the audience ""sees"" invisible threats through the movement of bushes, tree branches, and tall grass.  Although Malorie's bravery in rowing the boat to sanctuary is admirable,  her problem of having to remove the blindfold briefly to find the sanctuary is not frightening enough to sustain the rowboat portions of the novel.  Also, the final ending is guessable, anticlimactic, and not particularly believable.  Because nothing much happens in this book, I rate BIRD BOX at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Negative
"In GRAND DELUSION, Jacob Burns is back--still making the questionable daily-life decisions of the sort that landed him in so much trouble in his delightful debut mystery, [[ASIN:B00AFLQK1M Breakfast at Madeline's]].  When a crooked cop, Jake's hated nemesis and very-public-enemy, is shot at 1 a.m. outside his home, Jake investigates.  But his timing is way off.  He arrives at a deserted crime scene, and is standing in his bathrobe over the body, when his cop friend and neighbor Dave arrives.  What else can Dave do, but arrest Jake as a cop killer?<br /><br />Of course the innocent Jake talks freely to the cops at the station, and his wise-cracking results in a ""confession"" that mires him even deeper.  Naturally Jake decides to investigate the crime himself--against the advice of lawyer, wife, friends, and cops--and ends up escaping from police car chases, hiding in bushes, hanging off tree limbs, and breaking into buildings.  In this adventure, Jake is aided by a neglected and streetwise child, Tony, who sleeps in the local cemetery to get away from his substance-abusing mother.<br /><br />Although GRAND DELUSION is an enjoyable cozy mystery--especially if you're already familiar with Jake--it's not as much fun as BREAKFAST.  It's well-written and well-plotted.  However, I don't particularly care for mystery/thrillers that build suspense by putting the main character ""in the frame"", or by making him/her the target of a serial killer or the actual killer being hunted.  Since I would have enjoyed this novel a lot more if Jake had been investigating on someone else's behalf, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  That said, I'm  still looking forward to reading the next book in the series, [[ASIN:B00DDT55W8 Strange Bedfellows]].",Positive
"Claire DeWitt is a Silettian ""detective""--a detective so completely dedicated to uncovering the truth (the always unpopular, always abhorrent truth) that she solves mysteries when all others have failed to solve them.  Her method is taken from D&Eacute;TECTION, a book by the once-revered-and-respected-French-master-detective Jacques Silette.  His book is misunderstood by most, and its publication caused him to be written off as a crackpot.  But Claire read the book, understood it, and became a detective (which ruined her life).<br /><br />Claire is the quintessential ""intuitive"" detective.  She solves mysteries with Clues, not facts.  A Clue can be anything from a poker chip lodged in a couch to a tow truck driver's feelings upon entering an abandoned car--but only a true Silettian detective like Claire can spot a genuine Clue when it presents itself.<br /><br />A book with such a wacky detective should be fun to read, but Claire isn't much fun, and the reader is completely excluded from the mystery-solving.  Claire sleeps around, steals prescription drugs from friends' medicine cabinets, and does many, many lines of cocaine while detecting (to focus her thoughts).  Perhaps Claire should be excused because the mystery she is solving is the murder of her former love, but she's hard to warm up to.  As for the mystery-solving, the reader can't participate, because only a Silettian detective like Claire can discover the actual Clues.<br /><br />Solving the murder mystery takes Claire on a name-dropping tour of the San Francisco Bay Area (e.g., a coffee shop on Valencia in San Francisco, a coffee shop on Solano in Albany, a cabin in the Redwoods near the Bohemian Grove, a restaurant in Concord, a miniature horse farm in Marin County, etc.). Unfortunately, the setting falls flat, because there is no description of any of these interesting, varied locales to bring them to life.  Also there are clunkers, the worst probably being Claire's observation that I. Magnin (incorporated into Macy's in 1994) is still hanging on as a retailer in downtown Oakland.  (The iconic art deco landmark I. Magnin building still exists, but it hasn't been a retail store for at least 20 years.)  Oddly, there is almost nothing about the Bohemian Highway in the book.  Most of the ""action"" takes place in San Francisco and in Brooklyn (in a secondary mystery plot that unrolls in alternating chapters).<br /><br />A jacket blurb proclaims that the author ""elevates the detective story as literature"".  Indeed, the novel is well written, and mildly entertaining (at least until Claire starts snorting cocaine at every opportunity).  But it's NOT literature, and it's not even a good detective story.  Because of the unconvincing setting, unlikeable detective, and unsurprising ending, I rate CLAIRE DEWITT AND THE BOHEMIAN HIGHWAY at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale.)<br /><br />This is the second Claire DeWitt novel, and seems to work all right as a standalone.  The first one is [[ASIN:B008NRY58K Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead  ]].",Negative
"THE DIABOLIST isn't your ordinary thriller--it's  a primer on types of occult and Satanic religions (anti-establishment? devil worshiping? practicing magic?), and is filled with philosophical discussions about the origin of evil (created by God? created by an evil entity equal to God?) placed in a general context of Zoroastrianism.  However, this serious content is presented in a way that isn't difficult for the reader to grasp, and it doesn't weigh the story down--certainly this book has plenty of exciting action scenes!<br /><br />Dominic Grey (in his third series appearance) is a master of jujitsu; he partners with Viktor Radek, a Georgetown University professor of religious phenomenology (the study of religious and cult beliefs in angels, demons, ghosts, Satanic possession, alternate planes of existence, etc.). When Interpol calls Radek for help with an unusual murder--the leader of an infamous Satanic cult suddenly burst into flames before his congregation, in the presence of a black-robed figure that briefly appeared and disappeared--the partners  commence an investigation that leads them to San Francisco, London, Paris and its catacombs, Cambridge, Whitby, York, and--ultimately--Sicily.<br /><br />Dominic is a one-man army, but may have met his match in Dante, a universally feared master knife-fighter.  Dante is the right-hand man of the Magus, a reclusive New Age prophet who is determined to merge all existing Satanic and occult religions into his own Order of New Enlightenment, and then to convert all mankind.  The Order has its own terrible rituals--including Black Masses with human sacrifices--all performed in honor of the evil god-entity Ahriman.<br /><br />THE DIABOLIST will appeal to readers having an interest in magic, Satanism, and the occult.  Dominic's jujitsu moves, as described in the action scenes, are convincing and seem plausible (although I know little about the martial arts).  The story is complex, with many unguessable plot twists, and all of the loose ends are tied up in a believable ending.  The book itself works fine as a series standalone (this was my first Dominic Grey novel).  However, at 468 pages, it seems longer than necessary.  Overall,  I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"A long-ago sibling rivalry has matured into a full-blown hatred.  An old collaboration has grown into a massive conspiracy that threatens the populace of Montreal, the politics of Quebec, and the stability of Canada itself.  In HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN, Chief Inspector Armande Gamache patiently investigates the long-hidden, underlying secrets behind a 70-year-old woman's murder, and a government worker's suicidal leap off Montreal's Champlain Bridge--a ""suicide"" that turns out to be murder after all.<br /><br />In this book, Gamache is severely handicapped in his investigations by the dismantling of the homicide department of the Surete du Quebec.  Gamache still commands the department, but his highly successful homicide team has been broken up, on orders from his superior, Chief Superintendent Sylvain Francoeur.<br /><br />Gamache's case begins when Myrna (a resident of the close-knit village of Three Pines) calls him regarding the disappearance of her friend Constance Pineault--who is the sole survivor of the famed Ouellet Quintuplets.  The Quints were little princesses who were given everything by the government of Quebec, but who grew into desperately lonely adults. Gamache's case ends with his old friends from Three Pines closing ranks to protect him from out-of-control government conspirators who want him dead.<br /><br />As with other Gamache mysteries, the plot of HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN is quite complicated, but Louise Penny's writing skills make it easy for readers to track the simultaneous threads.  Even so, I found this ninth Gamache novel to be unusually slow-moving at times.  The Quints' story was interesting, but I guessed the ending fairly early.  The conspiracy story provided a satisfying conclusion to the La Grande hydroelectric dam story chronicled in [[ASIN:0312626908 Bury Your Dead]], but was tacked on and not particularly believable overall. However, this book is an absolute must-read for all fans of the excellent Chief Inspector Gamache series (which begins with [[ASIN:0312541538 Still Life]]).  Overall, I rate HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"When I ordered LIGHT & LAYERED KNITS, I expected a collection of patterns for layered garments that were intended to be layered together, that would be shown on models wearing the garments in layers.  Instead, this is a collection of lightweight tops (and a few sweaters) that are mostly suitable for layering.  (I guess that a cardigan worn over a dress is an example of ""layering"".)<br /><br />What initially got me excited about this book were the designs with elements of bold directional knitting:  Pier 37 (cable-enclosed keyholes at front and back necklines); Ruffle Shell (diagonally placed neckline-to-hem ruffle across front); Zigzag Shell (two-color intarsia front with contrasting colors meeting in bold, irregular zigzag at center front); Origami Flower (two-color front with colors meeting at third-color diagonal band placed shoulder-to-waistline); Tuscany Lace (keyhole neckline, shown on cover), and Kathmandu (princess-shaped bodice with peplum).<br /><br />Alas, the ""directional"" patterns are not knit directionally, and thus aren't very technically exciting.  Except for Kathmandu (which uses picked up stitches), the directional effects are achieved by knitting shaped pieces or strips, fitting the pieces together like jigsaw puzzle pieces, and sewing the pieces together.  (In Zigzag Shell, the irregularly-shaped half-fronts are knit in one piece as intarsia, but the zigzag seam is then accented with a separately-knit, sewn-on i-cord.)<br /><br />Some of the non-directional patterns that I like are Jane Austen Spencer (a short, U-necked, narrow-sleeved lace jacket); Lace Finery (a sleeveless top with an asymmetrical lace-rib collar); Celtic Queen (a top with short cap sleeves decorated with Aran cables); Tailored Pleats (an elegant v-collared pullover with ""pleats"" that create a peplum); and Wrap Blouse (an elegant wrap-around sweater with three-quarter sleeves, linen-stitch waistband, v-neckline, and offset diagonal lower-front edges).  There are also patterns for plain and decorated tees, a zip-front jacket, a couple of tunics, and a couple of cardigans.<br /><br />All but one of the designs are knitted in DK weight or sportweight yarn (which means a lot of stitches to knit for an adult garment).  The remaining one design (Bold Aran)  is knitted in medium worsted weight yarn.  All in all, this is a nice collection of patterns for wearable lightweight sweaters and tops that are variously suited for wearing over or under regular clothing or suit jackets.  I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Author Lucy Main Tweet is a former ""fashion leader"" for Talbots, Evan Picone, J. Crew, and Bernard Chaus; during her professional career, her passion was needlepoint.  When she left the fashion industry in 2008, she accepted her mother's suggestion, and took up knitting.  Thus, by her own admission, she is a ""novice knitter"".  Her lack of knitting experience really shows in KNITOLOGIE: CREATING PERSONAL HEIRLOOM KNITS.<br /><br />As a novice knitter, Tweet got bored with casting on, knitting, purling, and casting off.  So she decided to make a scarf, using these basic skills, that would be personalized with her own initials.  As a result, the bulk of KNITOLOGIE consists of giant knitting stitch grids (not standard knitting charts), with numbered rows, that graph a design for each letter of the alphabet.  In the accompanying photos, the letters are usually made in reverse stockinette on a stockinette background.  (But of course they can be knit in stockinette on a reverse stockinette background; or all in stockinette or reverse stockinette if you use two colors of yarn.)<br /><br />The remainder of the book consists of extremely simple patterns for square pillows, mittens, mitts, rectangular scarves, and baby caps--all of which use one or more letters from the alphabet grids.  Brand-new knitters may find the alphabet and patterns useful, but they will have to look elsewhere for even the most basic how-to-knit instructions.<br /><br />KNITOLOGIE is a beautifully designed book, expensively produced with lovely color photographs.  It even has a ribbon bookmark--with a cardboard ""swatch"" square to weight it down--attached to the inside back cover. (Be careful when you open the book, or the ribbon will tear the book's back endpaper.)  However, the book's production values do not make up for the lack of useful knitting content.<br /><br />When I purchased this book, I expected a book with an assortment of knitted alphabets, possibly accompanied by a text discussing how to design attractive knitted monograms.  (Such a book would be a welcome addition to my knitting book collection.)  However, KNITOLOGIE has only one block-letter alphabet--and that alphabet is one that could be designed by anyone with a pad of graph paper.<br /><br />As a hardcover, coffee-table-sized, 160-page book, KNITOLOGIE is probably priced reasonably at slightly under $22.  But KNITOLOGIE should have been published, if at all, as an inexpensive leaflet or paperback for novice knitters like the author.  Because the book is overproduced (and consequently overpriced considering the actual knitting content), I rate it at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  For now, the Internet is still the best source for knitted alphabets to be used for personalizing your hand-knitted garments and accessories.",Negative
"As a long-ago art history major, I love the many included photographs of the medieval church paintings that inspired the 20 patterns in MEDIEVAL-INSPIRED KNITS.  Also, I very much enjoyed reading author Lundberg's text, which describes both the churches (located in Uppland province, Sweden) where the paintings can be found, and the specific elements of the paintings that she decided to adapt for her patterns.<br /><br />However, Lundberg's unquestionably attractive sweaters strike me as relatively mediocre Fair Isle knitting designs.  (There are patterns for 5 cardigans, 11 pullovers, 1 pair of half-gloves, 1 scarf, and 2 children's sweaters; some of the cardigans and pullovers are vests).  For me, none of the designs really cried out ""knit me!""  Probably I would like the designs better if the background colors departed more from the backgrounds in the original paintings, and changed subtly every few rows (as is done in many Fair Isle designs to create color depth and added interest).  Experienced Fair Isle knitters can easily change the background colors this way, if they wish.<br /><br />My favorite designs are the ""Harkeberga Twisted Leaf Panel"", which uses white yarn in the outlines of leaves so that the stitches resemble beads; the ""Sanga Verdigris Panel Sweater"", which has an allover snowflake-like motif  arranged in rows of light turquoise, dark turquoise, and malachite green on a white background; and the ""Norsunda Arch Panel Vest"", which combines cables with an intarsia leaf motif to form a striking vertical front panel.  (The ""Norsunda"" vest is probably the most difficult to knit pattern in the book.)<br /><br />Most of the sweaters are knit in sport yarn on US 1-2 and 2-3 (or US 2-3 and 4) circular needles.  The patterns are written with one or two sizes for each sweater--this is normal for Fair Isle patterns having large-scale brocade designs.  The patterns include clear charts,  in color, for the elaborate motifs used.  These designs involve a considerable investment in knitting time, but can probably be knit by adventurous intermediates as well as experienced knitters.  Because I loved the photos and text, but wasn't bowled over by any of the individual patterns, I rate this book at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"KNITTED TEDDY BEARS: DRESSED WITH HANDKNITS has simple patterns for small (10""), medium (13""), and large (17"") bears.  I purchased this book because I thought the clothes (including undergarments!) were cute.  Nearly all of the clothing patterns are modeled in the cover photograph and the ""Look Inside This Book"" feature, which show the jacket, coat, overalls, sweater (striped version), and pants.  In addition, the book has patterns for an undershirt, boxer shorts, a scarf, a charming lacy dress, and a delightful pants suit with a lacy tunic.<br /><br />The patterns are written in row-by-row instructions.  This means that if you use the same yarn and needles for the basic bear and the clothing, the clothing will be sure to fit.  The bears are knit on double-pointed needles:  for the large bear, size US 8; for the medium bear, size US 4; for the small bears, sizes US 1.5 or US 2.5.  For the yarns used in the models, the brand names are given, but not the specific yarn gauges.  You can substitute any yarn that states on the label that it is suitable for knitting on the needle size you use.  The patterns recommend stuffing the bears with wool (but I would at least try stuffing mine with polyester fiberfill).<br /><br />This is quite a slender volume:  just 68 pages (including two pages for ""Notes"").  Because the book is so short, and has such a limited number of clothing patterns, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"As you would expect from a well-known crochet designer like Kristen Omdahl and publisher Interweave Press, THE FINER EDGE: CROCHETED TRIMS, MOTIFS, AND BORDERS is a beautiful book.  The full-color photos are gorgeous, and the crochet patterns have both written-out and charted instructions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed, because I expected a collection of many patterns for crocheted edgings.  (Can anyone ever have enough patterns for decorative crocheted edgings?)  The book does indeed deliver a collection of interesting edging designs, but it is focused on ""expanded use of edgings to create entire fabrics, make individual decorative motifs, and produce three-dimensional designs"".  Thus only about half the book is devoted to an Edgings Reference Library (20 top-down, 8 bottom-up, 14 side-to-side, 12 miscellaneous).<br /><br />The rest of the book is devoted to Projects (10 in all).  Some of the projects are quite innovative:  (1) a cowl made of crocheted-together edging strips, (2) a car coat with a collar and edging of vertical stripes worked in horizontal rows, (3) a net top with applied spiraling flower edgings, and (4) a flower crocheted onto a bag made from simple square motifs.<br /><br />Because of the limited number of actual edging designs, I rate THE FINER EDGE at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  If you're looking for a collection of crocheted edgings, you might consider these excellent ones: [[ASIN:1579909140 The Complete Book of Crochet Border Designs: Hundreds of Classic & Original Patterns]], [[ASIN:1933027355 Crocheting on the Edge: Ribs & Bobbles*Ruffles*Flora*Fringes*Points & Scallops]], or [[ASIN:0486252388 Traditional Edgings to Crochet]].

"In KNIT VINTAGE, well-known designers Madeline Weston and Rita Taylor present more than 20 classic knitwear designs, updated for modern tastes from designs originally published in the 1930's, 1940's, and 1950's.  Most of the designs are for body-hugging tops, like the one in the cover photo, but there are also designs for a ""Wallis Simpson"" cardigan, a Tyrolean-flower-patterned cardigan (intarsia), and some very pretty cabled and lacy twinsets.  All of the designs have a definite ""vintage"" look--and you probably won't want to knit them unless you have a taste for ""retro"" clothing.<br /><br />The full-color knitwear photographs by Debi Treloar are beautiful, and the written-out instructions seem to be clear (as I would expect from Weston and Taylor).  Nearly all of the designs (sweaters, stockings, skirt and top, beret) are knit in fine yarns, on 3mm to 4.5mm needles (US 2 to US 7), in gauges of 6 to 8 stitches to the inch.  This means a lot of knitting, especially for the twinsets!  You will probably need at least intermediate knitting skills to knit the body-hugging designs, because they have a lot of shaped increases.  Because of the limited appeal of this pattern collection, I rate KNIT VINTAGE at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"EXORBITANT PRIVILEGE is a readable, somewhat general, historical account of the development of the present-day international monetary system.  In particular, it discusses the post-WWII shift from the British pound to the U.S. dollar as the leading international currency, and what this has meant and still means to the U.S. economy.  The ""exorbitant privilege"" is the advantage enjoyed by U.S. merchants, investors, and banks in NOT having to pay currency conversion charges or arrange for acceptable international currency when conducting foreign business transactions across national borders.<br /><br />Chapter 5, which talks about the 2008 stock market crash that so damaged the U.S. housing market and produced the current economic recession, interested me most.  However, the author talks mainly about the broad forces (lack of regulation, too much leverage, misplaced belief in mathematical formulas for ""risk management"") that produced the financial crisis.  I was hoping for a more detailed explanation of ""derivatives"" and exactly how they operated, to help me understand what happened.  However, the book told me general things that I already knew, and went over my head in its assessments and assignments of blame for the disaster (given my minimal knowledge of economics).<br /><br />The speculations about the probable emergence by 2020 of the Chinese renminbi as  another international currency that will compete with the U.S. dollar are interesting and persuasive to a nonexpert like myself.  However, to get the most out of this book, I think that one needs to have devoted some time to studying economics.  Because it is readable and includes excellent explanatory footnotes, I rate EXORBITANT PRIVILEGE at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"ANCIENT EGYPT IN LACE AND COLOR is a paperback collection of 12 attractive lace shawl patterns.  Each pattern is introduced by the entertaining Egyptian folk tale or historical fact that inspired  the shawl. For example, the ""Osiris"" shawl has motifs (13 full moons, a fish, and leaves) that symbolize the 14 pieces of Osiris' body and the cedar tree where Osiris' coffin lodged after floating down the Nile.<br /><br />All of the patterns are charted (no written out instructions).  The charts are large and easy to read without using a photocopier to enlarge them.  Color photographs show each shawl on a model and also laid out completely flat, so that you can see all the details.  The text and matte photos are printed on lightweight paper that's just one step above newsprint.  I purchased my copy from a non-Amazon seller for about $27, and was a little surprised at the paper quality.  However, given that comparable shawl patterns are often sold online for $6 to $10 each, perhaps the price is reasonable.  The book also includes a very short list of suggestions for further reading on Egyptian mythology, art, religion, symbols, and daily life.<br /><br />The shawl models are knit from various indie dyers' yarns (Cephalopod Yarns, Claudia Hand Painted Yarns, Indigodragonfly, Rocky Mountain Dyeworks, the Verdant Gryphon, Zen Yarn Garden), and links to the dyers' web sites are included.  As with nearly all lace shawl patterns, other laceweight yarns can be easily substituted.  Most of the patterns require one 40-inch, US 6 circular needle; some patterns require a US 1-1/2, US 2-1/2, US 3, or US 5 circular needle.<br /><br />Photos of the individual shawls (Osiris, Fields of Malachite, Seth, Girl With the Rose Red Slippers, Memphis, Nefer, Anubis, Nefertari, R and Apep, Egyptian Gold, Bennu, Thoth) are available on the publisher's web site. I rate this book at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Some assembly required!  KRUSTEAZ CINNAMON CRUMB CAKE & MUFFIN MIX tastes good, but requires more preparation steps than you expect from a cake or muffin mix.  If you're making crumb cake, you have to layer the cake mix and crumb topping, swirl the batter with a knife, and then sprinkle on a final layer of crumb topping.  If you're making muffins, you have to fold half the crumb topping into the cake mix, and then sprinkle the remaining crumb topping on top.<br /><br />My husband loved these.  I loved the cake part, but felt that the cinnamon/sugar/crumb topping was too sweet.  However, you can't really go wrong with Krusteaz mixes, particularly [[ASIN:B0016BU7AK Krusteaz Banana Nut Muffin Mix)]] and [[ASIN:B0016BU7GO Krusteaz Cranberry Orange Supreme Muffin Mix]].<br /><br />For a crumb cake or 12 standard muffins, you need one egg, 2/3 cup water, and one package of the mix.

"The subtitle of PATCHWORK KNITTING makes an important point:  this is a book of projects to knit AND crochet.  The concept is that you knit ""patches"" (squares, rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids), and crochet them together into garments and throws.  The patches are knitted with yarnover eyelets all around the edges, and then single crochet stitches are worked into the eyelet ""holes"" to join the patches and create decorative crochet seams.<br /><br />According to author Johanna Schwartz, the crocheted seam ""always has the same distance to the border"" of individual patches, so that ""a correct fit is guaranteed.""  Presumably the fit is guaranteed if you follow the individual project instructions carefully--but this garment construction method surely requires a designer to plan the patch sizes and shapes quite carefully in advance.  The photo on the book cover illustrates clearly how various kinds of patches are combined into a ""shaped"" pullover sweater.<br /><br />The garment project patterns have charts for different sizes that tell the knitter (1) how many stitches to cast on, (2) how many rows to knit, and (3) how many eyelet holes to make, for each patch in the garment.  The charts also say how many different-sized or different-shaped patches are needed, and how many of each to knit.  Schematics show how to assemble the patches.  Each project has extensive written-out instructions.<br /><br />The project patterns include (1) a flared skirt, (2) an oversized jacket, (3) a scarf with pockets, (4) a hat with colorful border, (5) a ribbon yarn top, (6) a vacation hat, (7) a shrug with a crochet flower, (8) a poncho, (9) a jacket/art vest, (10) a woman's pullover, (11) a plaid jacket, (12) another scarf with pockets, (13) a pullover with stripes,  (14) slip-on slippers, (15) slippers with pompoms,  (16) a handbag with floral granny squares, (17) a pillow, and (18) a reversible throw.  My favorites are the woman's pullover (shown on the book cover), the pompom slippers (a small project cleverly constructed from square and triangular shapes), and the reversible throw (probably the easiest to make and to ""customize"" into one's own unique throw).<br /><br />But all of these projects are complicated to knit and assemble! Because PATCHWORK KNITTING teaches a new and original garment construction concept, I rate it at 4 stars.  However, I'll probably never make any of the projects, because it's easier for me to knit garments the usual way.",Positive
"Walter Mosley is well-known for his mystery novels (the Easy Rawlins, Fearless Jones, and Leonid McGill series).  This book is totally different:  it consists of two short fantasy stories, each with a philosophical twist.<br /><br />In ""The Gift of Fire"", Mosley envisions Prometheus' return to earth.  The immortal, taking on the name of ""Foreman Prospect"",  rekindles the nearly-dead spark remaining from his original gift of fire, and gives mankind a second, even greater, gift of fire.  The second gift, a force for healing, compassion, and sharing, manifests itself through the Pentecostal preaching of a young boy, known as ""Chief Redd"", who is cured of near total paralysis by his reception of the second gift on mankind's behalf.<br /><br />In ""On the Head of a Pin"", Mosley imagines a situation in which a technological gadget--developed as an animation tool to create movies indistinguishable from live action--turns out to connect with, and display  on a woven wire screen called ""the sail"", all of the thoughts of all of the creatures that have ever existed on the planet earth.  Different individuals see different ""movies"" on the sail; and, depending on their innermost personalities, may see things so disturbing that they will die from merely watching.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading both of these stories, but especially liked ""On the Head of a Pin"".  I always love science fiction stories that involve parallel universes, and this story has a highly creative and different approach.  I rate the book at 3.75 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.",Positive
"Bess Crawford, a WWI army nursing sister, genuinely cares about people.  So when she returns home to London from the French warfront on Christmas leave, and finds a battered wife with a concussion in the doorway of her flat, Bess quite naturally agrees to accompany the injured woman to Sussex to ensure her safe return to her family.  After arriving in Sussex, Bess accidentally learns some dark family secrets, and her already delayed Christmas visit to her parents in Somerset is further delayed by the murder of a houseguest in Sussex.  Ultimately, Bess is charged with a virtually impossible task to accomplish upon her return to wartime France:  locating an orphaned French child who may be the love child of the army officer husband of the battered wife.<br /><br />A BITTER TRUTH is the third book in Charles Todd's ""Bess Crawford"" series.  The story unfolds in a leisurely fashion, the murders are civilized (without gory descriptive details), and the backdrop of WWI England is well drawn.  Author Charles Todd (a mother and son team) writes extremely well, and has a wonderful knowledge of the WWI period that is incorporated in all of the Todd mystery novels.  Even when the plots, like this one, are a little far-fetched, Todd holds the reader's interest and wraps everything up in a believable fashion.<br /><br />A BITTER TRUTH is a little bit lighter on the WWI historical detail than usual, so I was a little disappointed.  This novel works fine as a standalone, but I would still recommend that readers new to the series begin with the first ""Bess Crawford"" novel, [[ASIN:B003JTHR6O A Duty to the Dead]], in order to better understand Bess' situation and her particular family relationships with her mother, the Colonel Sahib, and Simon Brandon.",Positive
"This is a lovely coffee table book that recounts the history of VOGUE KNITTING magazine, commencing with its Fall/Winter 1982 re-launch.  The VK editors have selected one or more popular patterns from most issues, and accompany the model photograph of each pattern with a few paragraphs that explain the editors' thinking at the time.<br /><br />For example, alongside Joan Vass' ""Tape Tee"" design [p.94]:  ""Sheen and sheer were the watchwords for Spring/Summer '98, as VK took the show back on the road to Miami Beach's Eden Roc Resort, where much of this breezy issue was photographed. . . . The 'sheen' came from . . . ribbon yarns. . . .  The 'sheer' came from a collection of peekaboo lace . . . .""  There are 18 patterns from the 1980s, 19 patterns from the 1990s, and 38 patterns from the 2000s.  Complete pattern instructions are included, reprinted as they originally appeared in VK (without updating for modern sizing, or any specific suggestions for currently available yarns; although the schematics, yarn weights, and gauge information make it easy for today's knitters to use the patterns.)<br /><br />Paging through the selections, knitters are reminded of the role that VK has always played in promoting hand knits as fashion.  In the 1980s, VK published designs by Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, and Norah Gaughan; in the 1990s, designs by Donna Karan, Adrienne Vittadini, and Missoni; in the 2000s, designs by Oscar de la Renta, Debbie Bliss, Michael Kors, and Kaffe Fassett.  These are only a few of the famous designers represented in this book.  Name-designer patterns are easily located by using the excellent Index.<br /><br />Because this book is (1) expensive, (2) directed at a limited audience (fashion and knitting history buffs), and (3) basically a collection of previously published vintage and not-so-vintage patterns, I rate it at 3.75 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.  It is a beautiful book with many full-color photographs, and should be a welcome gift for many knitters, especially long-time, serious knitters.  For those interested in knitting fashion history, another very good book is Sandy Black's [[ASIN:0500284016 Knitwear in Fashion]].",Positive
"As a knitting history buff, I like this book a lot.  It's a pattern collection with a twist:  the patterns are inspired by knitting fashion eras.  Fashionable handknits and knitting fashion trends in each era (the roaring twenties, the glamorous thirties, the thrifty forties, the fabulous fifties, the swinging sixties, the groovy seventies, and the dramatic eighties) are described at the beginning of each era's chapter, and then illustrated with photos taken from the era's knitting pattern books.<br /><br />What I particularly like, is the way that each garment pattern captures the flavor of its era.  For example, there is (1) a bed jacket from the forties, converted to a modern bolero (the cover photo), (2) a cloche hat from the twenties, complete with artificial flowers, (3) a beaded angora cardigan from the fifties, (4) an Aran cardigan from the sixties, (5)  a poncho from the seventies, and (6) a batwing sweater knit in glittery yarn from the eighties.  In addition, there are patterns for twinsets, headbands, a lacy accent collar, a Pucci bag, flapper and mini dresses, a Fair Isle vest, oversized pullovers, socks, and leg warmers.<br /><br />The original patterns inspired by each era are updated in sizing and fit to accommodate current knitting fashion tastes.  Yarns used to knit the garments are all modern yarns that are  currently available (or an equivalent yarn is available).<br /><br />Probably I'll never knit any of these patterns, but the garments are attractive.  Certainly the book is not a serious reference for knitting historians, but I enjoyed reading the historical text and looking at the photos.  Overall, I rate this book at 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars (""I like it"").",Positive
"If you already own the previous five volumes in the STITCHIONARY series, you will probably want to purchase VOGUE KNITTING STITCHIONARY VOLUME SIX: EDGINGS to keep your set current and complete. However, VOLUME SIX, like the others, is nothing more than a somewhat unwieldy coffee-table-book collection of ""more than 200"" edging patterns ""taken from the pages of Vogue Knitting magazine.""<br /><br />The patterns are organized into seven general categories: ribs, texture, cables, lace, color, unusual, and crochet.  In each category, the edgings are arranged in order from the easiest to the most difficult.  Instructions in the ribs, texture, unusual, and crochet categories are written-out (row-by-row); instructions in the cables, lace, and color categories are both written-out and charted.<br /><br />Nearly all of the edging patterns are for decorative hems, knit vertically.  A few patterns are for horizontally knit edgings with stitches picked up from the long edge after knitting.  There is no instructional material on (1) attaching edgings to projects; (2) selecting appropriate patterns for different kinds of projects; or (3) understanding or using the charts and written-out instructions.  There is one page of instructions for yarnovers (illustrated with line drawings), apparently taken from the publisher's excellent reference book, VOGUE KNITTING. There is also a short glossary of knitting terms used in the book.<br /><br />For each edging pattern, there is a beautiful, enlarged, color photo of a swatch knitted in the pattern. The selection of patterns is somewhat random, because VK magazine is the only pattern source, but there are many quite beautiful edgings included.  The perfect edging can change an ordinary shawl, scarf, or sweater into something extraordinary--and for that reason, you can never have too many collections of edging patterns.  However, because of the lack of instructional material, and the lack of horizontal edging patterns, I rate this book at only 4 stars.<br /><br />Other sources of edging patterns that I highly recommend include: [[ASIN:1931543402 Knitting on the Edge: Ribs, Ruffles, Lace, Fringes, Floral, Points & Picots]] (the first of Nicky Epstein's three excellent collections of edgings); [[ASIN:0312363257 150 Knitted Trims: Designs for Beautiful Decorative Edgings, from Beaded Braids to Cables, Bobbles, and Fringes]] (an inexpensive but limited paperback collection); [[ASIN:1579909140 The Complete Book of Crochet Border Designs: Hundreds of Classic & Original Patterns]] (a wonderful sourcebook); [[ASIN:1596683007 The Beaded Edge: Inspired Designs for Crocheted Edgings and Trims]] (delicate beaded edgings for silk scarves), and [[ASIN:0762104058 The Ultimate Sourcebook of Knitting and Crochet Stitches]] (an excellent stitch dictionary with a few basic edgings).  Knitters shouldn't shy away from crocheted edgings, because they're easy to do, and often give the prettiest results.",Positive
"Primarily a pattern collection, this book offers many fresh ideas for using knitted-in pleats (tucks) to shape garments or embellish garments.  My favorite designs are (1) ""Shoulder Chic"", a beaded, scoop neck, cutoff tee that uses pleats to pull the center front and center back upwards into graceful curves; (2) ""Vested Interest"", a little vest that uses pleats for a raised rib effect all over the back, and for shaping that pulls in the sides of the vest for a snug, flattering fit; (3) ""Borderlines"", an elegant, mostly sideways-knit jacket with vertical pleats at the center fronts, and horizontal pleats at the cuffs; and (4) ""Long Way Back"", a stylish pullover with elongated back and horizontal pleats at the lower edge, cuffs, and collar.<br /><br />There are clear technical instructions, with drawings, for knitting full-row, partial-row, and puffy pleats.  For a pleat (often called a tuck), you pick up stitches from a previously knit row on a spare needle, and then knit together the stitches on the spare needle and the stitches on your working  needle.  If you can do a three-needle bind-off, you can do these pleats!<br /><br />Partial-row pleats are great for shaping garments, as an alternative to knitting short rows.  Puffy pleats make the pleats really stand out, because the stitches in the rows between the knitted-together rows are doubled with increases, and then decreased back for the final knitted-together row.<br /><br />Because both the technique and the patterns are so simple, I rate this book at 4 stars (""I like it"").  It's a book that is nice to have, and that should be a welcome gift for any serious knitter, knitting book collector, or knitter who loves one or more of the patterns.  If what you are interested in is just knowing how to knit these pleats, the technique is also explained (under ""pull-up stitch"") in my favorite general knitting reference book, [[ASIN:0762102489 Knitter's Handbook : A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Techniques of Handknitting]].",Positive
"About half of this book is devoted to short, heart-warming stories about the family ""roots"" of popular knitting designers.  The remainder is devoted to designer knitting patterns ""inspired by"" the designers' grandparents, parents, and their places of origin.<br /><br />Dedicated knitters will no doubt enjoy reading about the family backgrounds of Wendy Bernard, Pam Allen, Meg Swansen, Ysolda Teague, Jessica Marshall Forbes, Kay Gardiner, Joan McGowan-Michael, Kristin Spurkland, Teva Durham, Jared Flood, Norah Gaughan, Anne Hanson, Leigh Radford, Chrissy Gardiner, Adrian Bizilia, Kirsten Kapur, and Emily Johnson.<br /><br />Many (but not all) of these designers contributed patterns, and there are some patterns contributed by designers who did not contribute family stories.  Most of the patterns are for small, portable projects (mittens, hats, socks, slippers, scarves, cowls, a dishcloth, a pillow), but there are some patterns for large, ambitious projects (a cardigan, a Fair Isle pullover, a cape, a lace-bordered shrug, an afghan, a lace baby blanket).  My personal favorites are Kristin Spurkland's ""Rose and Cross Pullover"" with Fair Isle yoke,  David Castillo's striped ""Conover Mittens"", Anne Hanson's ""Crocus Patch Baby Blanket"" with its complex allover lace pattern, and Cookie A.'s ""Wan Jai Socks"" that have gently undulating, street-like curves along the sock legs and feet.<br /><br />The book does not include any historical ""grandmother knitting"" patterns--which was a disappointment for me.  There are no handed-down family patterns, no patterns actually knitted by or invented by the older generations of the designers'  families.  Nevertheless,  because of the entertaining, anecdotal stories and the variety of attractive patterns, I rate this book at 4 stars.  It should make a welcome gift for any serious knitter.",Positive
"If you want to learn how to smuggle and sell endangered butterflies, read this book! It recounts, in detail, the recorded conversations between a notorious butterfly seller/smuggler and an undercover U.S. Fish and Wildlife investigator that culminated in multiple illegal sales and deliveries of the world's most-protected, most-critically-endangered butterflies (Alexandrae, homerus, chikae, and hospiton).<br /><br />On the basis of this recorded evidence, the seller was ultimately arrested, convicted, and confined for two years in a U.S. federal prison. However, the conversations as reported also reveal the seller's methods for (1) gathering the critically endangered butterflies so prized by collectors, (2) disguising the specimens as legal butterflies, (3) shipping the CITES-protected butterflies across international borders, and (4) avoiding getting caught even if the illegal merchandise is intercepted.<br /><br />According to the publisher, the author of this book is a freelance journalist who specializes in wildlife enforcement issues. No doubt she wrote this book to call attention to the ineffectiveness of current methods of enforcing laws designed to protect endangered species. (For example, the book tells us that the butterfly seller's packages were always delivered, even though the undercover agent had alerted customs officials to be on the lookout.) Unfortunately, because the book offers no suggestions for better enforcement, it does no more than explain how and why the illegal butterfly trade goes on. Indeed, at the end of the book, the butterfly seller is conducting business as usual in Japan, because he still has the best butterfly contacts in the entire world.<br /><br />The book recounts the investigation as if the Fish and Wildlife investigator were telling his own story. It is a mildly interesting story of what it takes to carry out an undercover law enforcement operation. (Among other things, it helps to be a person who has learned as a child to concoct believable lies for protection from bullies, and who is trained as a lawyer.) However, the book is NOT recommended reading for young people, because of the extensive quotations of lewd remarks made by the seller that reveal his infatuation with the Fish and Wildlife investigator.",Negative
"This is a nice pattern book, but the ""colorful festive ornaments"" subtitle is a bit misleading. With few exceptions, the photos show Christmas balls that are knitted in just two ""colors"": red & white, red & silver, or black & white. Some photos show balls that have colored sequins attached. The authors explain that they use red & white because that combination looks best against a green Christmas tree. Of course, knitters can knit the balls in multiple colors, but there is only one example: ""Tricolor"", shown on the book jacket cover at the top.<br /><br />There is one basic, easy-to-knit pattern for the balls. You knit a tube, starting with a few stitches, then increase and decrease to get the ball shape, and end once again with only a few stitches. The ball is stuffed, the tube is sewn closed, and the yarn ends are crocheted into a hanging loop. Detailed instructions are given for crocheting the hanging loops, but non-crocheters could certainly use wire hangers.<br /><br />The ball designs are added by ""knitting in"", using Fair Isle technique; or by embroidering, using duplicate stitch technique. The duplicate stitch method is clearly illustrated. However, the ""knitting in"" method is only vaguely discussed. Knitters who are unfamiliar with color knitting will need to consult something else (to learn about charts, floats, tension, and handling two yarns) if they want to ""knit in"" the designs.<br /><br />The book has clear, easy-to-read charts for a wide variety of simple motifs: geometric patterns, snowflakes, Norwegian roses, stick-figure skiers and dancers, hearts, anchors, reindeer, flowers, birds. Many of the motifs are taken from, or inspired by, traditional Norwegian knitted sweaters, hats, and mittens.<br /><br />There are many photos of ornate traditional Norwegian Christmas ornaments (handmade from wood or glass), printed holiday books and cards, and holiday decorations (including a miniature dollhouse).  However, there are no instructions for knitted centerpieces, wreaths, or window dressings (as I expected from the subtitle).  Because of the excellent charts, but lack of examples of multi-colored Christmas balls, I rate this book at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",Positive
"Author Henning Mankell gets high marks for inventing a new method of ""killing off"" a series detective.  However, if you're over 50, or if you're particularly fond of Kurt Wallander, you may find this eleventh and last Kurt Wallander mystery to be somewhat depressing.  Much of the story is devoted to 60-year-old Kurt's reflections on aging and death, which are triggered by his granddaughter Klara's birth, his one true love Baiba's death, and his own worrisome memory blackouts that signal the inexorable onset of Alzheimer's disease.  Who would have imagined such an ending for Wallander?<br /><br />In this novel, Wallander investigates the totally unexpected disappearance of his daughter Linda's future father-in-law Hakan, a retired Swedish naval officer who commanded both submarines and surface vessels engaged in hunting enemy submarines. Wallander suspects that Hakan's disappearance could be related to a 1981 Cold War incident in which a Russian submarine ran aground in Swedish territorial waters, or possibly to the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme.  Wallander's strictly unofficial investigation turns up a number of memorable characters, including Linda's likely husband-to-be Hans, Hakan's best friend Sten, Hakan's wife Louise, and Hans' severely disabled sister Signe.  The story also adds to the reader's prior knowledge of Wallander's close relationships with Linda, and with fellow police officer Martinsson.  The plot of THE TROUBLED MAN is entertaining, and has a lot of twists.  However, I doubt that many readers will be surprised by the ending, or by the identity of the villain.<br /><br />My acquaintance with Kurt Wallander comes mostly from the BBC television series, which I enjoyed immensely (for a DVD, see [[ASIN:B001VLBDB2 Wallander: Sidetracked / Firewall / One Step Behind]]).  This was my first Kurt Wallander novel, and although it did not exactly bowl me over, it was good enough that I'll be going back to read at least some of the earlier books in the series (for the first Wallander, see [[ASIN:1400095824 The Pyramid: The First Wallander Cases]]). I rate THE TROUBLED MAN at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.",Positive
"If you're thinking about becoming self-employed--as a consultant, freelancer, independent contractor, or other provider of personal services--then this book will be helpful to you.  If you're already such a self-employed person, then it probably won't tell you much that you don't already know.<br /><br />Much of the book is devoted to getting started:  (1) the pros and cons of self-employment;  (2) selecting a business type; (3) choosing a name; (4) deciding whether to work at home or at an office; (5) obtaining licenses and permits; and (6) considering various kinds of insurance.  Other chapters deal with ongoing business operations:  (1) rates and billing; (2) paying self-employment taxes; (4) taking advantage of available business tax deductions; (5) handling employee taxes; (6) setting up record-keeping and accounting systems;  and (7) choosing and contributing to a retirement plan.  Additional chapters--the ones that I found most informative, as an already self-employed person--deal with specialized legal issues:  (1) being reclassified as an employee; (2) honoring copyrights, patents, and trade secrets; (3) using and creating written client agreements; and (4) getting help in resolving contract disputes.<br /><br />The book includes sound advice, and  tells you everything you need to know to get started as a self-employed service provider.  It's easy to understand, although the coverage is generalized and a bit superficial.  Because of that, and because the book isn't particularly useful to those who are already self-employed, I rate this book at 4 rather than 5 stars.<br /><br />If you're a self-employed person looking for help with taxes, then I would recommend a different Nolo title: [[ASIN:1413313302 Tax Deductions for Professionals]].  If you're looking for advice about becoming self-employed as a business owner, rather than as a provider of services, this book recommends yet another title: [[ASIN:1413310559 Legal Guide for Starting & Running a Small Business]].",Positive
"John King is the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's architecture critic, and I'm a regular reader of his intelligent, insightful columns about The City's successful and not-so-successful buildings.  However, this book was a great disappointment to me.<br /><br />1. It's small:  just a little 5"" x 7"" handbook that can be tucked into a purse, a pocket, a Christmas stocking, or a tourist's bag.<br /><br />2. It's a spotty collection of mini-photo-essays of only 50 notable San Francisco structures--some obscure, some very famous.  There are two pages (two photos and one text paragraph) devoted to each structure.<br /><br />3. The book fails as a tourist's guide.  Although street addresses are given for each structure, there are no maps to show where the buildings are located within The City or relative to each other.<br /><br />4. The handbook-size format means that the photos are too small to be enjoyed as portraits of beautiful or intriguing buildings.<br /><br />In sum, this is nothing more than a by-producted collection of King's previously published newspaper feature columns, with full-color rather than black-and-white photos.  In my opinion, it is a ""non-book"", and valuable primarily as a travel souvenir.<br /><br />I would not have purchased this book, if I'd had a chance to see it first.",Negative
"Bricklayer Steve Vail is a former FBI agent because he's no good at following rules.  But this character flaw makes him highly effective when it comes to crime-solving, whether the task involves locating a young child's kidnapper, tracing a disappeared FBI employee, or unmasking a ring of Russian spies.  Steve also has a talent for spotting important details, in crime files and crime scenes, that everyone else has overlooked. So when Kate Bannon, Steve's former FBI partner (in [[ASIN:0061827029 The Bricklayer]]), needs help restoring her credibility after some Russians made it look like she had attempted suicide, the FBI director offers Steve a temporary job working counterintelligence with Kate.  Steve reluctantly takes on the mission, which is to locate several active Russian moles in the U.S. government.<br /><br />AGENT X has all of the necessary components of a modern spy thriller:  an intricate plot with many twists and turns; lots of suspenseful, high-danger, action scenes that showcase Vail's MacGyver-like resourcefulness; and puzzle-solving reminiscent of Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE.  The book is reasonably well-written, although the writing is a bit jerky in places.  Besides Vail, the book introduces a couple of interesting, well-drawn characters in Luke Bursaw, a former partner of Vail's, and John Kalix, a deputy assistant director who wants his incompetent boss' position.<br /><br />I would like this book much better if Kate, who is supposed to be highly placed in the FBI, were not such a limp dishrag and doormat.  Kate is in charge of the special assignment, yet she defers to Steve whenever there is a decision to be made.  As might be expected, Steve prevails in overcoming Kate's insistence that their  prior romantic relationship is over. Also, Kate's resourceful, narrow escape from the Russians' attack in the opening scene is simply not believable, given that she has been both  drugged and poisoned with carbon monoxide.  Because of this cardboard Kate, who seems to be included only as a female love interest and foil for cowboy-former-agent Steve, I award this otherwise entertaining novel 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.",Positive
"The subtitle of this book says it all:  ""Anything-but-Square Shapes for Garments, Accessories, Afghans, and Throws"".  Included are directions for making a wide variety of knitted and crocheted blocks (circles, squares, triangles, hexagons, octagons, pentagons, snowflakes, stars, flowers, hearts, shells, leaves) that can be used individually to decorate garments and accessories, or combined into afghans and throws.<br /><br />A very nice feature is the book's illustrated table of contents, set up as a ""motif gallery"" with a small photo of each block design above a page number for the pattern instructions.  This makes it easy to pick and choose favorite designs from the book's entire collection of patterns.  The book includes a discussion of techniques for fitting odd-shaped blocks together, for arranging blocks with or without spaces between them, and for working half or quarter motifs.  Also included are directions for ""connector"" blocks that can be used to join individual blocks.<br /><br />The knitted blocks (73 designs) have written-out instructions, and the crocheted blocks (77 designs) have both charted and written-out instructions.  Symbols on the pattern pages indicate each pattern's difficulty level (novice, intermediate, expert).  As a knitter, I was particularly intrigued by the designs for the two-tone pinwheel circle, the knit ribbed diamond, the tilted square, the hexagons, the five-pointed starfish, and the reverse stockinette heart.  As a crocheter, I loved the square made of connected circles, the open trefoil, the pretty snowflake, and the sweet heart.<br /><br />This is an excellent starter collection of attractive designs for shaped knitted and crocheted blocks.  I awarded it 4 stars rather than 5 stars because (1) the instructions for joining motifs are somewhat general and not as clear as I would like them to be; and (2) other collections that focus on knitted blocks or crocheted blocks have more designs. For crocheters, two very good sources of additional shaped block designs are [[ASIN:1603420398 Beyond-the-Square Crochet Motifs: 144 circles, hexagons, triangles, squares, and other unexpected shapes]], and [[ASIN:1579909132 300 Classic Blocks for Crochet Projects]].

"Is this a novel, or merely a fictionalized biography?  Although it is written with a novelist's skill--with believable dialogue, convincing characterization, vivid description--it doesn't exactly tell a story, because the ""plot"" so closely follows the chronological events in the life of Clara Driscoll, the likely true designer of the famous Tiffany lamp.<br /><br />As author Vreeland states in her Acknowledgments:  ""Were it not for the zest of Victorians for regular and detailed letter writing, the world would not have known of Clara Driscoll . . . .""  Vreeland's novel is based on Clara's detailed correspondence to family members about her work in Louis Comfort Tiffany's glass studios from 1892 onward.  The correspondence, which did not come to light until 2005, has convinced at least some experts that the famous art nouveau ""Tiffany lamps"", with their butterfly-, dragonfly-, and floral-themed leaded-glass shades, were not Tiffany's creation at all, but were actually the product of Clara's ideas and designs.<br /><br />Vreeland takes the reader inside the Tiffany workrooms, and does an excellent job of describing the extraordinary effort put forth by designers, glass selectors, glass cutters, and foundry workers in hand-crafting each new Tiffany lamp.  (To better appreciate Clara's brilliance as a designer and production supervisor, readers should visit the Tiffany-studios web site, and follow through the beautifully illustrated description of the making of a replica Tiffany ""tulip"" lamp.  Also, check out the photos of Clara's dragonfly, butterfly, wisteria, and other lamp shade and base designs.)<br /><br />Vreeland brings to life the oddball bunch of characters (free-thinking landlady, gay artists, businessmen, straight-laced married couple, others) that Clara encountered daily at her boardinghouse; and also provides glimpses into the luxurious Gilded Age lifestyle of Tiffany himself, a member of the extraordinarily wealthy upper class.  In the novel, it is hardly surprising that Clara feels a special, intimate, artistic bond with Tiffany--because of their long-shared secret plan to develop a lamp with a leaded-glass shade.  But of course, the plain-faced Clara is practical enough to look for a husband within her own social class.  And even after falling in love, Clara is in no hurry to marry, because of the strict Tiffany Studios rule against employing married women.  As soon as she marries, Clara will be forced to abandon the glass designing work that means the world to her.  (Photos of Clara and the ""Tiffany girls"" employed in the glass studio can be found by searching the web).<br /><br />Because I have always loved Tiffany lamps, the novel makes me want to read Clara Driscoll's letters for myself, to separate the facts of her life from the fictional details so ably supplied by author Vreeland.  Although the novel reads too much like biography to suit my personal taste in fiction, it is nevertheless interesting, entertaining, and is ""a good read"" that tells a fictionalized ""story behind the story"" of the iconic Tiffany lamp. I rate the novel at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.",Positive
"Knitting books that have ""Easy"", ""Simple"", or ""Quick"" in the title are often disappointing, but this book is a delightful exception. It has clear instructions for 15 hats (including caps, bonnets, and berets), 11 mittens (some can be knitted as gloves), 7 socks (including a spiral sock), wrist warmers, and ankle warmers.  The patterns are all written for only one size (adult woman: average hat size 22"", hand width 3.75"", leg width 4.25"").<br /><br />Most of the hat designs are accompanied by designs for either matching mittens or socks, and a few (Baggy, Stars, Spruce, and Flaps) have designs for both matching mittens and socks.  The patterns for heel-less spiral socks, a hat with earflaps, and ankle warmers are nice bonuses.<br /><br />I was particularly intrigued by the ankle warmers (""What do you do when your feet are cold and your shoes are too tight for wool socks?""), which I hadn't seen before.  An ankle warmer is a heel-less, foot-less sock cuff, with an attached strap that goes around the arch of the foot to hold the ""sock top"" in place.  Ankle warmers appear to be fairly simple to knit, and the author rates them as an ""easy"" project.  The ankle warmer pattern would be easy to adjust to fit any size of person.<br /><br />The book has an interior spiral binding, which is popular with many knitters because the pages lie flat.  Check the ""Look Inside"" feature on the product description page for complete instructions for knitting the Baggy, Scraps, Spruce, and Cables hats, and for a photo of the earflap hat (on the Table of Contents page).  This book is a great gift-knitting book, as long as you only need patterns for adult women.  It would rate 5 rather than 4 stars if the author had included instructions for resizing the patterns to fit a wider range of persons.",Positive
"New knitters may enjoy making the capelets (8 designs), cowls (10 designs), and collars (7 designs) in this book.  However, to my eye, the finished accessories are not very attractive.  Most of the garments are knit from worsted, bulky, or super-bulky yarns that visually overpower the small-scale projects.  The heavy yarns also add bulk to cowls and collars that will probably be worn under winter coats.<br /><br />The capelet shown on the cover is not typical of the other capelets, which are generally shorter and quite loosely knit.  One ""lacy"" capelet is heavily adorned with ribbons at the neckline.  Many of the cowl/collar patterns are for wide garments that stand up around the neck and chin.

"When I ordered this book, I thought it would be about Daniel Spiegelman, who in 1994 stole roughly $1.8 million in priceless books and manuscripts from Columbia University's Butler Library.  Although Spiegelman is briefly mentioned in THE MAN WHO LOVED BOOKS TOO MUCH, the book is about another notorious rare book thief, John Gilkey.  Gilkey, unlike Spiegelman, has apparently never made national news headlines.  But ""John Gilkey"" has become a household word among rare book dealers, particularly those who belong to the Antiquarian Bookseller's Association of America (ABAA).<br /><br />This book is the end product of the author's extensive series of interviews with Ken Sanders (a rare book dealer and the ""bibliodick"" who caught Gilkey), other ABAA members, Gilkey's family, and Gilkey himself.  Although the author in no way condones Gilkey's criminal behavior, she is relatively kind to him.  She allows Gilkey to explain to readers for himself why he steals rare books, by simply reporting, more or less neutrally, on what he told her in their interviews. (Some of the interviews take place while Gilkey is in prison, some take place in downtown San Francisco after he is released from prison.)<br /><br />To say that Gilkey ""loves books"" is perhaps an overstatement.  He is fixated on the idea of owning a rare book collection, because of the enormous cachet that such a collection enjoys.  A rare book collection, after all, tells the world that the owner is unquestionably a person of refinement and taste.  Gilkey not only sees nothing wrong with ""getting"" rare books from book dealers, he hates spending his own money on books.  He has schemes that make it easy for him to get rare books ""free"", and he likes the fact that rare books appreciate in value.  Put simply, Gilkey steals rare books because he wants them, and because he can't afford to buy them.<br /><br />This book provides an interesting look into the mind of an unusual, specialized kind of thief.  It also offers insight into the rarified world of rare book collectors and dealers.  It tells a story, is well researched, is well written, and includes just the right amount of detail, so that the reader doesn't lose interest.  This rates 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars because the subject matter is limited to the exploits of a single book thief.<br /><br />As it turns out, there is a book written about Spiegelman ([[ASIN:0275993310 The Book Thief: The True Crimes of Daniel Spiegelman]]), which I now hope to be able to read.",Positive
"No surprises here:  for the most part, tattoo artists' drawings and paintings executed on paper and canvas, rather than on living human skin, bear a strong resemblance to tattoos.  However, for anyone interested in tattoo art, this is a worthwhile book, because most of it consists of full-color pages of artwork.  The book is a treat to look at.<br /><br />ART BY TATTOOISTS showcases the personal, conventional artwork of 26 expert tattooists, male and female.  Each artist's chapter of color plates is prefaced by a short interview, in which the artists talk about why they became tattooists, when they got their first tattoos, and what, if any, creative distinctions exist between their tattoo art and their more conventional--and perhaps more serious--other art.",Positive
"A lawyer, law student, or paralegal can never have too many law dictionaries!  This one is a ""starter dictionary"", with simple, generalized definitions of terms that an individual might overhear or otherwise encounter while working around legal professionals.  It's a dictionary to consult when you don't want to interrupt a conversation to ask what is being talked about.<br /><br />However, the word selection is somewhat spotty.  For example, the PKPA (Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act) and UCCJEA (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act) are defined, but there is no mention of the equally important ICWA (Indian Child Welfare Act).  Also, there are definitions for ""community property"" and ""separate property"" but none for ""transmutation"" or ""tracing"".  Many of the included terms aren't legal terms at all, at least not in the traditional sense.  Examples of these are the Internet terms ""phishing"", ""cybersquatting"", and ""dooced"".<br /><br />A major shortcoming of the dictionary is that many definitions are vague and wander off into discussions of related concepts.  For example, ""forum"" is defined as: ""The court in which a lawsuit is filed or in which a hearing or trial is conducted.  The appropriate forum depends on which court has personal jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the case.""  Some definitions don't quite hit the mark with me.  For example, ""BFP"" is defined as: ""Slang for bona fide purchaser.""  To me, the term is not slang, but an acronym in wide use. Perhaps the authors believed that ""acronym"" wasn't ""plain English""--even though Google searches for texting terms like ""BFF"" will take you immediately to online dictionaries of acronyms.<br /><br />For law students, the definitions are not precise enough.  For example, ""adverse possession"" is defined, in part, as: ""A means by which one can legally take another's property without paying for it,"" and goes on to say that the requirements usually include continuous and open use for a period of five years or more, and paying taxes.  Black's Law Dictionary includes the additional information that law students will need, which is that acquisition of title by adverse possession requires nonpermissive use that is actual, open, notorious, exclusive, and adverse for a statutory period.  Also, for persons representing themselves in court, the definitions are probably not precise enough.<br /><br />An odd feature is the inclusion of  short quotations, bits of legal trivia, and movie descriptions--identified respectively by drawings of a loudspeaker, a gavel, and a film canister.  These items are scattered randomly throughout the dictionary.  They are entertaining, but suggest that the dictionary doesn't take itself particularly seriously, given that they don't seem to illustrate any definitions on the pages where they appear.<br /><br />In short, this dictionary is no substitute for a standard legal dictionary.  The dictionary is useful for understanding legal terms in a general sort of way, and it may be helpful in unlocking the meaning of the definitions included in a  standard legal dictionary.  It also may prove to be enjoyable casual reading for prospective law students, legal buffs, and dictionary buffs like myself.  This dictionary will go onto my bookshelf of legal dictionaries, but it definitely won't be the one that I reach for first.",Positive

"In The Archived, Mackenzie Bishop is a 16yo Keeper, unique in that she took the job at 12 years old, four years before the minimum age requirement. Her grandfather - or Da - passed the job on to her, and a special exception was made because of her excellent training and drive.<br /><br />A year before the story begins, Mackenzie's 10yo brother has been killed in an accident, sending her family into a spiral of grief. They aim to get a &#34;fresh start&#34; by moving an hour away, to the city, into an old hotel-turned-apartment building called the Coronado.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of Mackenzie's everyday family life and secret Keeper life is interesting, and Schwab does a good job in painting the emotional details of a family dealing with loss. Mackenzie is a formidable character, seeming to enjoy the &#34;hunt&#34; of her job, and dangerously curious about the finer workings of the Archive as well as the history of her new home. Part of a Keeper's gift is being able to &#34;read&#34; memories off of people and places, and soon after she moves in, Mackenzie starts to explore the history behind the Coronado. What she finds is a murder mystery with ties back to the Archive, which sets off a domino effect of disruption and violence.<br /><br />My favorite parts of The Archived are Mackenzie's recollections of her grandfather, and all he taught her regarding her role as Keeper. They are poignant memories, laced with love, and it helps to sharpen Mackenzie's character and bring Da into focus, a character who is never actually alive in the time period of the book.<br /><br />The writing style is measured, with parts of the story picking up the pace, which gives the book some nice dynamics. I liked the character of Wes - a boy Mackenzie meets at the Coronado - and even some of the minor characters (like her parents, her best friend, some of the other residents of the Coronado) are given enough weight to matter. The Librarian Roland is also a favorite as a mentor and father figure to her in the Archive.<br /><br />For all of its unique qualities and solid characters, though, some aspects of the plot become a little convoluted as the murder mystery grows to include more details, more people, and more long-lasting implications. When I finished the book, I literally had to scratch out notes as to how all the pieces ultimately fit together. I was also more than a little confused at the speed at which a relationship develops between Mackenzie and Owen, a character she meets in the Narrows. It didn't make much sense, and didn't hold much tension or meaning to me since it seemed to happen in an instant.<br /><br />Despite those slight drawbacks, The Archived was a solid, fresh read, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other mysteries and adventures are in store for this new series.",Positive
"According to writer Mark Lockwood, there's no shame in being called a hack, a hired gun. They get the job done, he says. But his ability to churn out product is not what drives world-renowned opera singer Merce Casals to choose him as the ghostwriter of her memoirs. ""He listens,"" she explains simply. And in George Rabasa's The Wonder Singer, Lockwood does listen, intently at first, to the diva weave her tale. But when his elderly muse dies suddenly, Lockwood becomes obsessed with listening to their recorded interviews night and day in an effort to finish her memoirs and do justice to her life story.<br /><br />Lockwood is not the only one vying to tell the diva's story, though. A top publishing agent and a famous author are on Lockwood's tail, aiming to retrieve the tapes and notes. This literary tug-of-war provides for some comical scenes as the writers try to outdo each other in digging for answers and mining Casals' contacts and relations (in one scene, Lockwood's rival even plucks some hair from the singer while she lies at rest in her coffin...later he submits it for DNA analysis, hoping it will offer an interesting twist to his manuscript).<br /><br />Joining Lockwood in his race to finish the book are Casals' former nurse, Perla, and a scarily-accurate Casals imitator named Orson. Casals husband, Nolan - placed in an assisted care facility by Merce years ago - even joins in on the caper. Not everyone is willing to play Lockwood's game, though. His wife, Claire, grows impatient with his obsession and his resulting distance from her (made only wider by Lockwood's foolish flirtations with Perla).<br /><br />My favorite part of The Wonder Singer was how well the author brought his characters to life. I could hear them, I could see them, I believed them. That doesn't mean I always liked them, which is even more impressive that the author made me care. I didn't like that none of the married characters seemed capable of being 100% loyal to their spouses. I was annoyed at how Lockwood became increasingly pathetic in his obsession with writing Casals' story. Perla seemed like a tease and a mooch. Orson was just...well...there for the ride, I guess. Nolan was hornery, though charming. And Casals herself could certainly behave like the diva everyone assumed she was. BUT...I still cared about each of them. I enjoyed them through all their flaws and foibles.<br /><br />I also think author Rabasa did a fantastic job knitting Casals memoirs - the story within the story here, the real ""Wonder Singer"" - into Lockwood's adventure. The sincerity of her life history helped to balance the off-kilter endeavors of Lockwood to bring her story to the people.<br /><br />The Wonder Singer was unlike anything I had read recently, and I really enjoyed the trip.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you to Caitlin at Unbridled Books for this review copy!",Positive
"In December 2006, my home state of Oregon was getting all sorts of national media coverage, and none of it was good. In early December, the Kim family - wife, husband, and two daughters from California - got lost traveling a logging road in the Southern Oregon snow. The father died from exposure while trying to find help; the mother and daughters were found alive. Then just two weeks later, three climbers went missing on Mount Hood. Our hearts already broken for the Kim family's loss, many Oregonians stayed glued to the news as the search for the hikers was complicated by horrible weather on the mountain. We were all hoping for the very best for these hikers and their families, but it would turn out to be another sad tragedy in our great state.<br /><br />When I saw that Karen James, wife of one of the climbers lost on Mount Hood, had written a book about her family's experiences, I was eager to read this story from her perspective. To me, she was a name and a face on my daily news during that dark month of December 2006. But in Holding Fast: The Untold Story of the Mount Hood Tragedy, I got to meet her and her amazing family, hear the love story behind her marriage to Kelly James, and discover the lasting faith that carried her through her loss.<br /><br />Holding Fast is a moving account of Karen's unwanted journey. It's written in a very conversational tone, creating an intimate atmosphere full of feeling. She gives precious insight into the passion that drove Kelly James to climb many of the world's greatest mountains. She shows how her faith, and the faith of Kelly's children, guided them through their unimaginable trials. She also pieces together details of Kelly's final hours, providing a likely scenario for what happened on the mountain and how Kelly honored his family in the last moments of his life.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and read it in just a few hours. I felt glad to be taken into Karen James' confidence and encouraged by the strength of her faith and the admonition she gives that we ought to appreciate every moment we have while our loved ones are here with us on earth.<br /><br />Thank you to Thomas Nelson for this review copy.",Positive
"Laura Miller's The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia is part literary history and critique, part biography, and part memoir. She combines all of these genres wonderfully in the pursuit of one goal: to convince readers that there is more to C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia than their reduction to Christian allegory.<br /><br />Miller's intentions are not entirely benign; she takes the Christian themes of Narnia very personally, and is frankly put off by them. As a self-described ""skeptic,"" she drifted away from the religion of her youth and settled on an idea of Christianity that leaves little to be desired. And yet, The Chronicles of Narnia remain the most important books of her lifetime. How can she settle the apparent discrepancy between her unbelief and her love of books so seemingly full of belief?<br /><br />Miller constructs this book in three parts, which seem to mirror the progression of her own relationship with Narnia. In the first part, she articulates all the reasons to love Narnia. It's a magical place, full of talking animals, with the appeal of a secret, private garden. Children especially identify with the world of Narnia because there, children are tested and challenged, and what they do matters. There is a satisfying weight to their thoughts and actions, and in a real world typically condescending to kids, young people find Narnia liberating.<br /><br />The second section of Miller's book details her discovery of the blatant Christian themes in Narnia. This was a betrayal to her, the idea of an agenda being injected into an otherwise pure reading experience. Now that C.S. Lewis the author is revealed in Narnia, she begins to realize there are other reasons not to blindly trust in the epic. Themes of racism, sexism, and elitism are apparent in the Chronicles, all stemming from Lewis' own flaws as a person. Miller is left feeling alienated and upset, until she gets some advice from author Philip Pullman, himself a detractor of Lewis and his creative worlds. Pullman tells Miller that if she is really interested in making peace with Narnia, she must find ""another way in.""<br /><br />The third section of The Magician's Book is a scholarly examination of the influences on Lewis at the time he wrote Narnia. The English landscape surrounding his home and haunts, his interest in Norse mythology and medieval romance, and especially his close relationship with fellow author J.R.R. Tolkein - all of these experiences factored in to the creation of Narnia as much as Lewis' conversion to Christianity. In finding evidence of these other crucial contributions to Narnia's universe, Miller is in essence ""reclaiming"" (as she puts it) Narnia for the readers who gain little from a Christian examination of the books.<br /><br />The Magician's Book is so well-written - I was consistently impressed with Miller's thorough research and amazing ability to transition from one idea to the next. Her interviews with other authors are seamlessly woven into the path of her journey here, and I felt the contemporary views really added to my understanding. Miller doesn't require her readers to be fellow experts in the Chronicles books - she does an excellent job summarizing parts of the books under examination. The only prerequisite to enjoying Miller's effort is a love of reading, and an appreciation for the many whys and worlds involved in the creation of any given text.<br /><br />Finally, While it is clear that Miller is trying to come to a heightened idea of ""full circle"" (love-hate-love Narnia), I must confess that I got caught up in the centrifugal force of the final turn. The third section was very heavy in research, and I felt it lost some of the more intimate tone of the first two sections. Still, I came away feeling that this book is an important companion to anyone's understanding and appreciation of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. I will also be enthusiastically recommending this as a book club read, since there is much opportunity for discussion, and I'm eager to pick the brains of other book lovers and new fans of Laura Miller.",Positive
"David Desmond's The Misadventures of Oliver Booth: Life in the Lap of Luxury (publisher: Green Leaf Book Group Press) is a light, clever satire on the social and economic particulars of life in Palm Beach and Paris.<br /><br />Oliver Booth is an unlikeable, unsympathetic, unethical buffoon. Passing off Mexican imports as European antiques, Booth occupies a small shop and apartment just off (as in, around the corner from) Palm Beach's trendy Worth Avenue. He's nearly $3000 behind in his electric bill and hasn't paid his rent in months. He dresses in gaudy clothes and throws his morbidly obese self into the path of his affluent, uninterested neighbors. If this book had been solely about this character, I wouldn't have finished the book. He's just that aggravating.<br /><br />But Booth actually serves as a catalyst for events that happen to two far more interesting characters: the wealthy, elderly matron Margaret Van Buren, and the young French traveler Bernard, who comes to work as a clerk in Booth's antiques shop.<br /><br />Through their random associations with Booth, Van Buren and Bernard meet, and the older woman sees great potential and talent in the Frenchman. She sends Bernard and Booth to Paris to purchase antiques for her guest house, and despite Booth's constant blunderings and attempts to interfere, the trip is a great success.<br /><br />Author Desmond does a good job of balancing the satirical tone of this book and his parody of Oliver Booth with a more heartfelt treatment of Van Buren's and Bernard's stories. Some of Booth's ""misadventures"" definitely go over the top, but they fit in the world of the book and provide some good chuckles. I've never been to either Palm Beach or Paris, but even I could see where Desmond was poking good-natured fun at the Dowagers in Paradise (DIPs) and the young Parisian students on strike for better cheese options.<br /><br />Desmond wraps everything up nicely for Bernard, consistent with the reader's desires for his future. In the end, I'm not sure Booth deserved what he ultimately got in terms of abuse and reversal of fortune. But I suppose you could say that he imported his fake European chaise and now he has to sit in it.<br /><br />The Misadventures of Oliver Booth may not necessarily need to move to the top of your To Be Read pile, but it's definitely a fun and harmless way to spend a few hours of your free time.<br /><br />Thanks go to Mini Book Expo for Bloggers for providing this free review copy.",Positive
"Austenland is the story of Jane Hayes, ""a thirty-something woman in possession of a satisfying career and a fabulous hairdo,"" who finds herself unmarried and harboring a dangerous obsession with the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice.  Her aged great-aunt figures out Jane's little secret and leaves something special for Jane in her will:  an all expense paid trip to Pembrook Park, Kent, England.<br /><br />At Pembrook Park, Austen's world comes alive with everyone taking on a different ""character"" and every detail of Victorian life painstakingly reproduced (right down to the corsets!).  It is quite funny to follow Jane's slow conversion to playing along with things, and read about her internal struggle between fantasy and reality.  I laughed out loud several times, and found myself smiling through nearly the entire reading.<br /><br />If this book hasn't been optioned as a film yet, it should be.  PRONTO!  That way I can eventually put the DVD right next to my own copy of the A&E masterpiece and have more outlets for my own Austen addiction!",Positive
"First, a definition (from Wikipedia):<br />Prescience is the full knowledge of all possibilities.... Throughout history a number of cultures have believed that oracles have possessed this ability. It is one of a number of psychic phenomena studied by parapsychology.  Although there is no scientific evidence for prescience, this has not prevented a huge number of people in the modern world from believing in astrology and visiting fortune tellers.<br /><br />When I brought this book home from the library, my girls asked what the title meant.  I told them that I didn't know exactly, I only knew it was supposed to be a mystery novel centered around the characters from Pride and Prejudice.  After trying to read this book, though, I wish I would have looked at the title as closely as my children.  To mix Elizabeth and Darcy with anything that leaned towards oracles, psychic phenomena, astrology, or fortune tellers?  That, my friends is just wrong.  But one thing at a time.<br /><br />I don't believe that Barris presumed to think anyone would mistake her voice for Jane Austen's.  Any of the modern books that try to follow the characters and storylines from Austen's classic novels seem built on the premise of ""We all know her stuff was better, we're just trying to have some fun here.""  And I think Barris did a fairly decent job of keeping true to the characters...I mean, sort of.  It wasn't horrible.  But it was like listening to a stand-up comic doing a passable imitation of someone else that is truly famous.<br /><br />Other reviews I've read for this novel lambast Barris' disregard for keeping with the proper vernacular of Austen's time.  This wasn't an element of the novel that bothered me the most, but it did cross my mind.  Like little weeds creeping up through fertile soil, modern snippets of conversation - or even just exposition - periodically slid into Barris' attempt at writing circa-Austen.  (ie:  one description of Darcy ""spooning"" up next to Elizabeth as she slid into bed)<br /><br />So, the writing wasn't terrible, the characters were recognizable, but things for me started to unravel with the format of the mystery.  Nothing really smooth about many of the plot ""twists.""  More like blazing red arrows hovering above heads as if to say, ""Look at me!  Listen to me!  I may be someone you want to remember for later!""  Barris may as well have put big asterisks next to each conversation about gothic novels, too - as if to say, ""HINT HINT HINT....COME AND GET YOUR DARK, SPOOKY, MYSTERIOUS FILL RIGHT HERE!"".<br /><br />After a while, it just got plain silly.  Right down to the part where the Darcys corner the bad guy and he spills out all his dastardly plans in a two and half page monologue.  And I like me some fantasy elements here and there, in the right place and with the right story.  But OH. MY. WORD.  This story ends with some incredibly laughable magical explanations for everything that has happened to the Darcys in ye olde Regency England.  And Elizabeth's final thoughts of the book made me wince and give woe unto the idea that there's more to come.  ""In quiet moments, however, she sometimes withdrew Professor Randolph's amulet and pondered his parting words to her.  'I believe you have a gift,' he had said.  'A very powerful one.  Should you ever choose to cultivate it, let me know.'  Perhaps one day she would.""<br /><br />Let me just tell it to you like this:  in my opinion, this book isn't much more than The Darcys Meet Scooby Doo and Gang.  If only I'd had the prescience of mind to know that before I bothered to waste my time!!",Negative
"What is it with this guy? I'll tell you something, he found a niche and is really working it. It's a good thing he works it well!!<br /><br />Gregory Maguire (author of Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and Wicked, among many others) turns well-known fairy tales on their heel (or hoof, paw, sticky digit...whatever) in Leaping Beauty, and Other Animal Fairy Tales. This book, recommended for youth 8-12 but really enjoyable for all, tells us the untold stories of characters like Goldiefox and the Three Chicks, So What and the Seven Giraffes, and Leaping Beauty herself. There are 8 stories in all, and certainly best enjoyed read aloud.<br /><br />Though Maguire tones down his acerbic wit for the young crowd, these stories leave plenty of opportunities for uncomfortable conversation with your child. For instance, they may ask you, ""Exactly what is a hot toddy?"" or ""Why would the bad guy make someone wear concrete boots?"". Then again, the actual fairy tales from Brothers Grimm were pretty controversial in their own way, too. It's all just good fun, though, and a great way to show kids that every story has two (or more!) sides.",Positive
"The story goes that in 1997 actress Sharon Stone was reading the diaries of playwright/novelist Christopher Isherwood and discovered that Christopher has collaborated on a screenplay with novelist/essayist Aldous Huxley. She asked permission to search the estate, and in a dusty trunk was found a yellowed copy of Jacob's Hands. The best guess is that the fable had been written in the late 1930's, when (as the back jacket says), ""a large sector of the intellectual community of Europe immigrated to the United States, to California in particular. What they found there was Nirvana - sunshine, freedome, mysticism, and the burgeoning movie industry."" The two great thinkers met amidst this illectual Utopia and wrote this work together.<br /><br />This is a short book, an easy read in an hour's time. As such, it is hard to say too much without giving it all away. Jacob is a good, honest, decent, sound, strapping young man. The kind of man that sees no ill will in others because he has none in himself. He learns as a farmhand on a California ranch that he has the power to heal. The power makes other love him, suspect him, and ultimately exploit him. He loves Sharon, the daughter of his former boss on the ranch. He meets Earl, a young millionaire with need of his healing powers. The three of them form a triangle that sort of reminds me of the ending of Ethan Frome (don't ask me why, though, since it's kind of a stretch).<br /><br />The overriding theme, I believe, of the book is this question: is it more important to heal the soul or to heal the body? Are they ultimately connected or mutually exclusive? There is also some discussion of how sometimes we hold on to our illness, our weakness; we are wont to let them go. Because somehow they come to define us, and we survive more with the fear than we can live without it.<br /><br />There is a brief introduction to the book by Aldous' wife, Laura Archera Huxley. It is useful in the fact that she gives some background into Aldous' thoughts on healing and the moral and religious implications of such a gift. It helps to set an informed backdrop to this interesting and thought-provoking fable.",Positive
"It's hard to believe that I've lived a complete life without reading a book by Mitch Albom. I've managed to value my loved ones, contemplate the nature of life and death, and cry at sappy Hallmark moments, all without ever reading the likes of Tuesdays with Morrie or The Five People You Meet in Heaven. With the release of his newest book, For One More Day, I wondered to myself: what have I been missing? Could my understanding of the world deepen, become more profound, if I just read something by this internationally recognized ""feel good"" author?<br /><br />I'm being a bit of a snob here - hopefully that's obvious. I've looked down my spectacle-saddled nose at Albom and his four-hankie books for a while now, but my curiosity really did get the better of me, and I did read. And you know what? It wasn't so bad! I'm feeling a little repentant now.<br /><br />For One More Day is the story of Charles ""Chick"" Benetto's rise to Major League stardom (using that term loosely) and his fall to shabby drunk. And all the people he hurts in between. The slim book focuses on Chick's attempt to utterly demolish himself, and the redemption he receives at the side of his dead mother. Yes, his dead mother. Chick admits that this could be some kind of ghost story, but it really isn't. It's about what remains when someone is gone, it's about pain that can be healed, it's about choosing to repair what can be repaired, while we can.<br /><br />I enjoyed this little book, and I confess that I did shed a tear or two. I also laughed quite a bit, specifically at two categories that Chick reflects on a good deal: Times My Mother Stood Up for Me, and Times I Did Not Stand Up for My Mother. I laughed because some of the situations were funny, but mostly because they were so familiar. We don't often think of the ways we could have stood up for our parents, honored them for all they have sacrificed for us. In short, I think we don't often think of our parents as people at all. In For One More Day, Chick gets an awesome opportunity to see his mother's life through others' eyes, and understand the value of the person that she was. It ultimately inspires him to understand better the person he himself could be.",Positive
"I recently ate dinner at a tiny Italian restaurant in San Francisco.  Highly recommended by local residents, the place had a simple charm that was at the same time both inviting and slightly foreign. I ordered the roasted chicken with potatoes, and marveled at how delicious the food was. There was no fancy sauce over the chicken or even an extravagant garnish to dress the plate. Just roasted chicken with a hint of rosemary, and soft, delectable potatoes on the side. I could taste the purity of the food, and was left utterly satisfied, without the feeling of gluttony or eater's remorse.<br /><br />I make the analogy of food with this website, and so I extend the analogy of this wonderful meal to my review of Kat Ricker's book of poems and short stories, Something Familiar. There is certainly something in this book for everyone - a bit of fantasy, a sample of memory, quiet humor, and even a story ""based on actual hearsay."" It is a small, simple, appealing, rich, wonderfully executed collection of writing.<br /><br />The title is entirely appropriate, for what I see as two distinct reasons. On one hand, I believe readers will find something in the stories and poems that is familiar to themselves. In ""Ray's Foul Ball,"" I saw myself as a parent in the juxtaposition of Ray's own individual dreams versus his selfless love for his daughter. In ""Remembering Mrs. Little,"" I saw myself on Mrs. Little's bed, pouring out her tin of buttons (only, in my memory, they are my grandmother's buttons, passed down through generations). And even in the fantastical ""The Secret of Lara Lee,"" I know what it's like to have ""something click"" and to understand Lara Lee's declaration ""Isn't it good just to be!""<br /><br />The other incarnation of the title is the way in which many of Ricker's characters, when faced with the circumstances of a changing life, retreat to something familiar in their own lives, or in their past. Oftentimes, you can even see it in their eyes. In ""Change of Venue,"" the artisan, faced with harsh financial realities, must turn to different pursuits, and yet you know the ""truth - eyes sparkled"" of where he would rather be. Old Michael's bent form is transformed in ""Walnut Harvest in Newberg,"" as he remembers his fine accomplishments and ""his eyes dawned"" through the recollection. And despite Mattie's confused behavior in ""Mattie's Orchids,"" something of her former self slips through when ""from the blankets, she turns and winks at you, twinkle of mischief in her eye.""<br /><br />The flowing theme throughout this book of ""something familiar"" is rounded out by some wonderful phrasing in the poems and stories. In fact, in some cases as I was reading, the title could have just as easily have been something *unexpected,* as Ricker puts images together in beautiful new forms. There are also moments of humor that gratefully caught me off guard. I really enjoyed this smooth book, served up with little flair, relying instead on its own, unpolished beauty to deliver an exceptional reading experience.",Positive

"This was a heartwarming and tender story about two neighbors that are instantly attracted to one another, but each of them have flaws. Two beautiful flawed characters that come from very different backgrounds, but who are very much alike.<br />These characters are well developed, lovable and real, their journey and issues tugged at my heart strings and made me cry. Afraid to hurt the other because of their flaws, they try to hold back their feelings and the truth. But will they be able to truly fall in love, if they don't know everything?<br />An amazing storyline with ups and downs, that will help them grow stronger, as well as closer, helping to heal those flaws with the power of friendship, passion and love.<br />This is the first story that I have read by Alexis Morgan and it was deeply emotional, heartbreaking and Poignant. It really brought home the importance of living every moment with no regrets, loving passionately and taking the time to truly enjoy life with the ones you love.<br />I voluntarily requested an ARC through NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for a honest review.",Positive
"This is a dark, dark story. It grabs a hold of you and at times it feels like you are the characters and you are experiencing these intense feelings of hopelessness as well as extreme rage. This is not for the faint of heart. It is written in the characters POV and this puts you right into Noah's and Angeline's head which is not always the best place to be. The two main characters are deeply scared and if you can get through some of extreme scenarios there is light at the end. Definitely you don't see this coming and I am trying to not give anything away but it does help cast the entire story in a new perspective. One that is good versus evil. So, if you like a thriller along with some romance this story is for you. It will be a topic of conversation you will share with friends when you are done. Great writing by both of these authors. Amazing intrigue. Keeps you thinking.",Positive
this is a good listen/read.  its very different from David Baldacci's other novels.  Tho I liked it a lot.  I have listened to all of David Baldacci's books.  Just love him,Positive
"This book is about an Instagram star who was raised in poverty in a religious cult environment. She did not have the upbringing that many of those who are successful have. As a result, she had to use her tenacity to succeed as an instagram star and find a way to build a house with her husband on what amounted to a shoestring budget. For instance, she used Instagram to partner with a door company and porcelain tile company to get their products for free and then feature them on her account. She had to get creative.<br /><br />In the next to last chapter she does provide some educational tidbits on how to use social media, but for the most part this book is purely inspirational. I absolutely loved it because it affirms how much a person can succeed if they have the tenacity to persevere and ignore all the naysayers and negative feedback. I do wish the book had more photos of the finished farmhouse in it. Other than this, it was a great read. Kudos to Noell Jett for her success both in her personal and professional life.",Positive
"I read this book from cover to cover and love it because there are at least 25 recipes that I earmarked and would try. I decided to make the savory vegetarian navy bean soup and it came out great. My boyfriend and I loved it. It did call for the use of canned beans but one can always cook the beans from scratch if desired, although there are no instructions for that in the book.<br /><br />The first 35 pages are dedicated to an introduction, meal plans, shopping list, description of mindful eating, how to support the immune system through food, etc. etc. These pages are brief but informative and provide the inspiration to try the recipes within.<br /><br />There's a recipe for every meal including breakfast, salads and soups, seafood, chicken, vegetarian mains, and desserts.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is a good addition to my extensive cookbook library.",Positive
"I read this cookbook from cover to cover. I love the introduction to pressure cooking as it describes how pressure cooking works, what ingredients go into mediterranean cooking, safety, what doesn't work well in the pressure cooker (like shrimp), etc.<br /><br />Of all the recipes, there is one that concerns me. The sausage bean soup has dried kidney beans in it. I was always told that kidney beans had to be soaked, then rinsed, and then cooked and rinsed again before fully cooking to keep them from being poisonous (more like to keep from getting an upset stomach). However, in this pressure cooker recipe, they are added dry so there is no rinsing out the toxins. Perhaps it is okay but there should be a mention that this is okay or acknowledge that kidney beans are toxic and that (perhaps) pressure cooking does away with these toxins.<br /><br />Nevertheless, most recipes sound great and use typical household ingredients. The only one I found that does not is the deconstructed lamb - stuffed cabbage recipe that requires a teaspoon of sumac.<br /><br />There is one recipe photo at the start of each chapter. There is a reference to which recipe it is a picture of. I decided to make the savory strata which is something I never heard of in my life. It did not look appetizing but it tasted great. Both my boyfriend and I loved the taste of the dish. (See photos of the various stages of development. I attached them in order but Amazon re-shuffles the photos, so they will be out of order.) It did take me longer to prep than the recipe stated but I find that is typical of all cookbooks--at least when I am preparing the food.<br /><br />In summary, I feel there are a lot of good to great recipes in this book. Note that almost any one of these recipes can be made on the stovetop too but for those who want to cook via pressure, this can be a great addition to their cookbook library. I know I consider this a good one to mine.",Positive
"I love Spanish, Columbian, Ecuadorian, etc. cuisine and this cookbook is a great compilation of recipes with the ""flavor of Spain."" There is a small introduction into Spanish cooking (the food staples and the culture) and the rest of the book is all recipes.  I found 27 recipes that I would definitely make.<br /><br />Most of the recipes require a moderate amount of time and ingredients. They are not quick recipes but not long either. I decided to make the Spanish Potato Salad and it was delicious. The only caveat is that one must be careful of the cooking times. The recipe called for 25 to 30 minutes to cook the potatoes and carrots and I thought that was a bit much. I cooked them for 18-20 minutes and the potatoes were overcooked and almost mashed. Therefore, it is important to just check the consistency of the food ingredient when cooking to make sure it is not being overcooked. Nevertheless, I loved the results despite the less than firm potatoes.<br /><br />I do wish this book had more photos. There is only one photo at the beginning of each chapter and it does not say what recipe that is a photo of. This is the only reason I rated this 4 stars. Otherwise, I feel this is a great complement to my extensive cookbook library.",Positive
"The recipes in this book are creative and atypical. At first when I read through them, I said I would never make many of them. However, I earmarked about 11 that I might make. Note that many of the recipes include more than eight items in the ingredients list (counting the spices) and do take some time to make. In addition, there are no photos, so I have to visualize what the dish might look like.  After reading this from cover to cover, I decided to make the ""Savory Egg-and-Salmon Avo Oatmeal"" recipe (see photo for finished dish). This recipe took me about 35 minutes to put together and make (excluding clean-up). The end result was absolutely decadent. I never would have thought any of these items could be paired together in the same bowl. Because there was so much food, I should have put the oatmeal in a bigger bowl and spread it out so that it could be seen in the dish. Since I had it in a smaller bowl, the oatmeal is hidden underneath in the photo. It was a recipe for one person but I was stuffed after eating it. In the future, I would reduce the salmon to two ounces. Note that I forgot to add the parmesan cheese the recipe called for; however, I am sure that would have tasted excellent in the dish. I was so ready to eat this, I just dug in.<br /><br />In summary, I was going to give this book 3 stars because of the absence of pictures and the atypical recipes. However, after trying this one recipe, I was so blown away by the savoriness of the dish that I decided this is a 4 star recipe book. Just remember that these recipes are not super quick, how it will come out must be visualized in one's head, the dishes will most likely be high calorie but reasonably healthy, and the recipes are outside the box of what one would normally think goes together (i.e. avocado stuffed plantain scoops; baked brie with sliced avocado and pomegranate seeds; roasted yellow pepper and avocado bisque, etc.).",Positive
"I never heard of Syd and Shea McGee before I ordered this book. However, with a title such as ""Make Life Beautiful"" from a ""design couple,"" I thought (like everyone else) that this was a picture book. Nevertheless, I read the reviews prior to ordering and discovered this is a ""words only"" story of one married couple's journey of setting up their own design business.  Since I love art, am a fan of high-end craft shows, and used to be a subscriber to Architectural Digest, their journey held my interest. It is a quick, enjoyable, and upbeat read.<br /><br />Both Syd and Shea, husband and wife team, describe how they wound up establishing their own design firm and going from Shea McGee Design (wife only), to Studio McGee in 2014, and also establishing their ecommerce brand McGee & Company, and opening a store and then closing it after Covid-19.<br /><br />What I love about this story is that they shared their ups and downs to their success. Sharing their experience proves to others who have a vision that this is what life and an entrepreneurial journey is all about. In addition to how their vision developed, Shea  also shares inspirational lines that will ""speak"" to most readers, such as:<br /><br />""Design is about creating and looking for opportunities to elevate everyday.""<br /><br />""Regardless of where you are in your journey, it's not about having all the answers -- it's about seeing the potential""<br /><br />In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed their story. Yes, I wish there were some pictures of the family or the original bookcase that started their journey, but I can search online and see a lot of their designs, so it is not totally necessary.",Positive
"This is a very small (5.25” x 8”) 58-page (ignore actual page numbers) pamphlet of details describing how to achieve customer success by delivering outcomes instead of output.<br /><br />The focus is to deliver outcomes over features by delivering something of value to BOTH the customer and the business. In order to achieve those outcomes, one must experiment. By experiment, that means trying several scenarios and measuring the results and getting feedback to help determine which path to success to take. Once an outcome is defined, then the intent is to deliver continuously.<br /><br />""Outcomes over Output"" requires a change in thinking.  At first the concept seemed easy to grasp but then I was not so sure as I read on. I really wanted more than this book could provide. On the negative side, there is a cursory mention of leading and lagging indicators, no index, and no glossary. However, there is still a lot packed into this tiny manual, so in this sense it is worth the purchase.<br /><br />I had to re-read this several times before I got it and this text only touches the surface. I wish there were several simple case studies that I could sink my teeth into. I personally did not understand or find the only case study (on the HBR organization) useful.  Nevertheless, this is the way I understood the concept being presented using a personal example of mine that I actually implemented over ten years ago.<br /><br />MY SITUATION (a.k.a. case study)<br />I spent a tremendous amount of money over the years buying merchandise of both excellent and poor quality from Internet (e.g. Amazon, etc.) and local stores. I wanted to let others know what I felt was good and not so good and why, so posting an Amazon review became a forum for the products that I purchased. This was my way of enabling others to make informed purchase decisions, spend dollars wisely, and not lose money like I had so many times. I had a choice to either implement my reviews (let's call them features) via the old way of thinking (output-based) over the new way of thinking (outcome based) as outlined below. I actually did implement this the old way at the beginning but then changed my tactic when I wanted to achieve higher positive rankings which would indicate the customer found my review helpful. When a customer finds my review helpful, it is both valuable to them and valuable to me.<br /><br />OLD WAY of thinking is Feature-based delivery:<br />- Develop features – Churn out a large number of features (in this example it would be reviews) by a certain date and time.<br /><br />- Impact / Result – Is an accumulation of a large number customer reviews that people either find helpful or not which results in my ranking either moving up or down.<br /><br />- Measurement of success – The number of completed reviews increases along with the potential to receive a positive ranking. <br /><br />NEW WAY of thinking is Outcome-based delivery:<br />- Outcome – (Customer Outcome) Enable customers to make informed purchase decisions based on my product review by highlighting its features or lack thereof and my usability experience. (Business Outcome) If I achieved this outcome, they will voice their opinion by voting positively on my review and my rankings will increase.<br /><br />- Impact – Is a change in ranking either up or down.<br /><br />- Key Result – Increase in positive votes that results in an increased ranking.<br /><br />- Measurement of success – Take a baseline of where the rankings are now after having implemented things the old way and get an idea of how fast the rankings move either up or down. Next track the increase in rankings by experimenting with the way the reviews are written and determine if the rankings increased more by delivering on the OUTCOME rather than being concerned about the OUTPUT.<br /><br />- EXPERIMENT - How I achieved this increase is by re-reading all my reviews to identify which ones got the most positive votes and determine why that was. Basically I was trying to ascertain what type of review satisfied the customer and what type did not. What I found is that household / consumer product reviews were most likely to receive more votes, especially if they listed the features or lack thereof, the pitfalls, and my experience. Also, those reviews that were focused on “my” (as in I) experience rather than in what “you” the user should do or not do or like or not like, received favorable feedback. Once I changed the “you” or “you should” to “I” or “I did,” I got more votes almost immediately. This required making changes to almost every previous review and doing so over a period of about three months. However, the delivery was continuous in the sense that as each re-written review was posted, the customer usually was able to use that review to make or not make a purchase decision and was more likely to vote the review helpful.<br /><br />In summary, the focus of this book is to help businesses understand that the goal is not to just get things out the door but to deliver value to the customer that then provides value to the business. The only way to do that is to focus on the outcome and experiment first to see which direction one should take. This book is definitely an excellent start. However, I feel I have to do a lot more reading so that it becomes second nature to me in order to be successful in driving business success via outcomes instead of output.<br /><br />UPDATE --> I decided to create a slightly fictitious example of what focusing on outcomes over output for the Amazon Vine program might mean. Amazon Vine is an invitation-only program that provides ""free"" products to their most valuable reviewers in exchange for a review.  By ""free"" it means the manufacturer supplies the product for free but the reviewer actually has to pay income taxes at the contractor rate on most of the products. I am a member of the Vine program, although this book I actually purchased via Amazon as it was not a Vine product.<br /><br />Therefore, below is what Jeff Bezos might have been thinking of if focusing on outcomes over outputs and defining leading, lagging, and balancing indicators. He would also be experimenting as he starts the program.<br /><br />OPPORTUNITY - The opportunity exists to increase customer purchases of new products by having buyers use Amazon reviews to evaluate those products prior to making their purchase decision. Customers spend a tremendous amount of money buying merchandise of both excellent and poor quality from Internet (e.g. Amazon, etc.). They want to know what other purchasers find valuable or not so valuable about a product and why. Posting an Amazon review is a forum for the many products people purchase. An informative review, enables customers to make informed purchase decisions, spend their dollars wisely, and not lose money.  Therefore, we want to institute a new program that brings visibility to pre-released and just released products by allowing our top reviewers access to these products in exchange for an informative review. When a customer finds a review helpful, it is both valuable to them and valuable to the “business” in the form of increased review and product rankings, higher visibility, and increased sales.<br /><br />PURPOSE - Our strategy is to sell more product and weed out substandard ones. Informative reviews assist the customer with making their purchasing decisions. This is linked to increasing sales to grow the business.<br /><br />OUTCOME - We believe our Amazon site can be used to enable customers to make purchase decisions of pre-released or just-released products, which would increase sales and increase trust in our review system. We will know we have achieved this by increasing sales and increasing the helpful votes on Amazon Vine product reviews.<br /><br />LEADING #1 - We will be measuring increased sales on similar products in our system against those offered in the Vine Program. For instance, our blow dryer sales are at 1M and typically we increase by 100,000 every QTR. We will be offering blow dryers on the Vine program and expect to increase sales by 150,000 every QTR as the reviews are posted because these products will achieve higher visibility as a result of numerous write-ups touting the products features.<br /><br />LEADING #2 - We will be measuring increased review rankings for the Amazon Vine products to ensure higher positive rankings. Typically, reviewers get 75% positive votes indicating the review enabled the customer to make a purchase (or not to purchase) decision. With the Vine program reviewers, we expect reviews will get 80% positive votes to 20% negative votes which indicates these reviews are more helpful under this program.<br /><br />LAGGING - Overall we expect Amazon sales will double yearly with the introduction of this program. Previously our sales were 100M and went to 110M after one year. We now expect 110M to go to 220M by next year.<br /><br />BALANCING: We expect review quality will slightly increase and trust in our reviews will increase. We will measure this by ensuring sales does not slide and product and review quality increases or at least stays the same.",Positive
"This is a stunning and large hardcover book designed for the bride and groom-to-be to guide them in styling their wedding. The first part of the book goes over wedding basics from flowers, stationery, dress basics, picking a venue date, etc. The second part provides ideas for the six wedding styles of romantic, lavish, modern, elegant, rustic, and vintage.<br /><br />As I was reading through this, I like the questions proposed that allows the bride and groom to decide what type of wedding they are looking for. This books entices one to dream and provides reasons for hiring a pro, deciding what type of calligraphy one might want on their invitations, etc. Obviously, this is mostly for people who have money to spend or at least what to dream what they would do with it if they had it. It is less useful for those spending less than $10,000 on a wedding.<br /><br />The only big negative is that some of the text in this lovely volume is written in white letters over pale pink or medium pinkish letters over pale pink making it very hard to read those sections--especially for my aging eyes. In addition, the front cover of my book was creased which distorted the word ""wedding"" as can be seen in one of my photos. It is mainly for these two reasons I took off one star. Other than this, this coffee table wedding book is just gorgeous and contains lots to consider before planning one's big day.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/4/2020 - I gave this to my upstairs neighbor who is a bride-to-be and she said she likes the way this book is laid out. She said this is very nicely done.",Positive
"I love America's Test Kitchen cookbooks like Cook's Illustrated and Cook's Country. They are well researched and well-written and this one from Cook's Country is no different.<br /><br />This is not a typical Italian cookbook. It is actually a blend of Italian and American as the title says. The recipes span the gamut from sandwiches, pizza, calzones, soups, and pastas to dessert like tiramisu and Italian rainbow cookies. A few of these recipes are a bit too hearty and calorie laden for my taste but each recipe is designed to have bold flavors.<br /><br />I loved reading this from cover to cover. I especially enjoyed the few stories in the book and reading each ""why this recipe works"" section before each ingredient list. I decided to make the hearty minestrone soup and it was superb.<br /><br />There are only a few things I was disappointed with with regard to the soup.<br /><br />- First, although I followed the recipe to the letter, it was way too salty for my taste. I believe the addition of the pancetta made it this way and that using no salt or 1/4 teaspoon of salt would be best.<br /><br />- Second, the eight (8) cups of water that are required for the recipe is not mentioned in the ingredients list. I would have preferred that be listed as I did not catch that until I read the recipe twice.<br /><br />- Third, it did not say what color cabbage to use. I chose red cabbage and my recipe came out looking just a little bit differnt.<br /><br />- Fourth, there is a step whereby the vegetables get put into a dish and removed from the heat before adding them back later on. I wish the step said to remove everything from the pot instead. I actually did that but I did question why it did not mention to remove the pancetta. There's no way to separate the meat from the veges, so it is (I guess) assumed that that would be removed too.<br /><br />- Finally, I would have like more beans in my soup. I did not feel eight (8) ounces was enough as I could barely see any beans in the finished dish and the dish was more watery than I would have liked. When a recipe says hearty, I expect the results to be more like a stew. In fact, their picture of the recipe looks less watery than mine and I followed the directions precisely.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the soup came out excellent as these are only minor observations with the saltiness of the dish being the most disappointing of all my complaints. I would definitely make this recipe again but I would omit the 1/2 teaspoon of table salt used in the soup.<br /><br />In summary, this is another excellent cookbook from Cook's Country. America's Test Kitchen does have a habit of reconstituting recipes from other cookbooks and I suspect they did the same here. Therefore, if you have all their books, you might find repeats.  Reading and making a recipe from this book made me feel like I was dining at a high-end pizzeria that is a meld of Italian and American cuisine just as the title of this cookbook indicates.",Positive
"This is a perfect beginner's guide to aromatherapy. A basic overview of what aromatherapy is, tools and equipment, a list of popular oil brands, and an inventory of the top ten oils are reviewed in the first third of the book (part one). There is also a mention of safety precautions to be aware of and some subsitutes that can be used in place of one of the top ten oils.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is that the last two thirds of the book (part two) is aromatherpay in action. There are recipes for various blends and purposes that can be used as inhalers, in diffusers, in lotions, and shampoos. Most of this book's recipes (about 97%) are dedicated to blends for inhalers and diffusers.  There are a few recipes I can see myself eventually making and using.<br /><br />In summary, this book is a well-rounded aromatherapy guide but it is by no means complete as the title suggests. I think it is a great complement to a well-stocked aromatherapy library.",Positive
"This text is really about Lyme+ (borreliosis, bartonella, brucella, F. tularensis, babesia, and other various species of borerelia...) and the transmission of vector-borne diseases from the bites of ticks, spiders, fleas, and other bugs. The premise is that the cause of most autoimmune disaeases are not autoimmune at all but the result of the body fighting an underlying infection. This fight is what causes an autoimmune response which doctor's then incorrectly diagnose as an autoimmune disease (named or unspecified) and then treat only the symptoms and not the cause.<br /><br />Infections from these vector-borne diseases mimic multple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (a.k.a. Lou Gehrig's disease), etc. Both authors had symptoms of autoimmune disease and actually needed only long courses of the appropriate antibiotics to be cured.<br /><br />The authors intersperses their claims with short stories of those who almost died or were told they had ALS or some other horrible disease only to be cured by being treated for Lyme+ with the appropriate course of antibiotics or pulsing (on again, off again, on again) antibiotics.<br /><br />The difficulty with modern medicine today is that doctors pigeon-hole a diagnosis, treat symptoms, and never look for or believe in an underlying cause. These infections, therefore, continue to cause concentration problems, insomnia,  neurological issues, muscle pain, fevers/chills/sweats, numbness or tingling, etc. Their belief is that antibiotics are the best tools to keep pathogens in check and that immunosuppression (drugs used on those with autoimmune disease) are the biggest reason behind superbug resistance. As stated in the book, ""Most of what we call autoimmunity is the immune system trying to target persistent organisms.""<br /><br />In summary, they have proven their argument to me. I always believed infection can be seriously detrimental to the human body; although, I never thought it caused autoimmunity. However, what the authors say makes absolute sense. Good luck finding a doctor to treat a patient in this condition. The authors recommend contacting ILADS doctors if one needs to rule out the possibility of Lyme+ as the reason behind their debilitating illness.<br /><br />On a negative note, this book is a bit scientific and not an easy read for a lay reader.",Positive
"The author, who was a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Education and Business, suffered a stroke on Labor Day weekend in 2010. This is her narrative of the challenges she faced and still faces and how she had to re-frame her identity. Within the context of her story, she weaves the narratives of other stroke survivors from the age of 13 all the way up to 64 years.<br /><br />What is very clear is that there is hope but there is also extreme disappointment when stroke survivors are not able to be the person they once were. Depending on the situation, the physical, speech, cognitive, medical, sexual, and support challenges differ as survivors navigate their life with a new identity.<br /><br />It was clear that most of the people interviewed for this book have family and other support. There was not one person who was profiled that did not have at least some support at the beginning. In this case, this book is a view of ""those who have."" A stroke survivor who has absolutely no family or friend support and no money or insurance would most likely not even have the good to moderate recovery some the of the survivors profiled have.<br /><br />In the end, the author lists the biographies of the survivors. Only one survivor was totally paralazed and mute and could only move her eyes. The rest did recover somewhat. What I love is that the author is forthright in saying she had help in writing this book due to her stroke. It makes one realize that accomplishments are possible if there is a support network available. Unfortunately for those who don't have that, the road to recovery, although possible, is bleak. I wish the author would have profiled those type people as well.",Positive
"I read this from cover to cover and found 14 recipes that interest me and I made one of them for this review.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book she discusses pressure cooking basics, such as how to reduce foaming with beans, what to cook on high or low pressure, etc. There is a chapter on grains, beans and legumes, soups and stews and chili, pasta, veggies, holiday and social gatherings (like drinks), and desserts.<br /><br />For some foods, such as pasta, time may not saved using a pressure cooker because of the time needed to come up to pressure. However, it is sort of a set it and forget it type cooking method.<br /><br />All her recipes have five core ingredients but the items normally kept on hand are excluded from that count. Therefore, spices, herbs, water, oil are not counted. The core ingredients are noted with an star. Each recipe lists calories, fat, protein, sodium, and fiber and how many people the recipe serves. There is also cooking time estimated.<br /><br />I made the mushroom and millet pilaf and it came out excellent and very tasty. After I dished it out, I added steamed kale on top for color and nutrition but that was not included in the recipe ingredients.<br /><br />My biggest negative with this book is that there are no pictures for the recipes except for one picture on the cover of the book and a picture that starts each chapter.<br /><br />In summary, one does not have to be vegan to enjoy this cookbook. I am an omnivore but absolutely love vegetables and vegetable and grain and bean dishes, so this cookbook is one of many in my library that will be useful to me and with which I can use my Ninja Foodi.<br /><br />PS - I uploaded photos of the dish in order of preparation but an Amazon system bug may re-order the photos.",Positive
"The goal of this ""project"" is to get the reader to write ""Thank You"" notes to everyone who made a difference in their lives starting with the closest family member. The idea is to enumerate ways these people made an impact, helped you in the past, etc. Besides people, she even suggests you write to places and things and even yourself. Just writing the letters and not even mailing them is good enough is some cases.<br /><br />I did feel the first 25 pages had a lot of filler text in it but after that the book is excellent. The author intersperses her story or message of thanks with some examples of what she wrote. She even writes letters to her grandparents who are dead so that she can experience the ""depth of what she lost"" but also thank them even though they will never get to read the letters.<br /><br />In most cases the letters should be mailed and nothing should be expected in return. This is a way of telling those you love how they matter to you in a positive way. Including an apology in the letter is acceptable if there was something that you needed to apologize for.<br /><br />In summary, the backstories and short snippets of the author's letters help the reader understand the message that should be conveyed. This is more a book of guidance than a ""how to"" text. More of us should follow this advice to help show appreciation to the people that matter most in our lives. It also serves as a legacy from you when you are gone.",Positive
"Time is finite and by squandering it, we destroy the present and rob our future. For example, if we waste time on tasks or experiences or friends that are not important, we could have reallocated it to spending time with our spouse, on self-improvement, or excercising which may be more important and might enhance our future (or increase life expectancy as excerising might do).<br /><br />The author examines many ways in which we could waste time and makes a compelling case as to why it is important to constantly re-evaluate where we put our effort by asking outselves powerful questions (PQs).<br /><br />The messages within is excellent except for the  vulnerabilities assessment (starting on Page 151). Most of the questions did not apply to me, so I answered them as if they did apply to me. For instance, the questions assume you have a spouse and children.  I believe they need to be redesigned to accommodate everyone. My score blantly missed two truths about me and it is possible the wording and the fact that many situations are not taken into consideration, caused it to be skewed.<br /><br />In summary this is a wonderful book. It would have received 5 stars from me, if it were not for the vulnerabilities assessment that I feel needs improvement.",Positive
"I read this book in about one hour. Ava, the author, published excerpts from her diary pages documenting her husband Richard's decline from both Parkison's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia. It is both a love story and sad story and a bit educational.  There is a chapter dedicated to what Richard sees as a result of his LBD. It is full of monsters and some non-sensical dialogue. There is a picture of him with Tacoma, a poodle they adopted for him and with whom he became best buddies despite his failing health. There are many chapters on the turmoil Ava faced daily.<br /><br />This book had me crying by the end. Although I already knew most of this, LBD is worse than Alzheimer's and the hallucinations, dementia, and failure of bodiy functions is heartbreaking to watch. The drug Nuplazid was a ""gift from the heavens"" for Richard in helping reduce the scariness of the hallucinations, but nothing could stop his decline as life expectancy is only 5-8 years from diagnosis.<br /><br />After reading this text, I am certain a friend of mine has both YOPD (young on-set Parkinson's disease--which he was diagnosed with) and LBD (Lewy Body Dementia) and it breaks my heart. However, after having read this, I still wanted more from this book in the sense of more detailed symptoms from when Richard first suspected something was wrong to the end of his life. I feel this story would be exceptionally helpful that way even though that is not the original intention of what is written in these pages.<br /><br />FYI, in an effort to learn all I could about PD and LBD, over the past four years I read 10 books on this subject and others with similar symptoms. Once this review posts, I will put a link to those reviews in case others are interested.",Positive
"This is really an interesting calendar. It is both educational and functional. It is almost sepia-toned and is non-descript in the sense that it is not as colorful as typical wall calendars. However, the first page shows four months of the previous year starting from September to December 2019. This is followed by 12 monthly pages with ample room to write appointments. I always love monthly calendars that have wide boxes for such details.<br /><br />I also like the natural-world-based information on each month. For instance, in January I learn that the norternmost part of the globe is the Artic Circle and that although I can drive over the northern ice cap with a truck, I would be driving on frozen sea ice and not land. There are about four facts per month.<br /><br />In summary, this calendar is appropriate for those who need big boxes to write appointments,  want to learn about the natural world, and do not mind that there are no colorful pictures but instead is almost septia-toned in its presentation.",Positive
"I ordered this with my friend's severely autistic son in mind. This very thin book introduces the concept of five love languages that can be used to ""love"" your spouse and your child or children with disabilities. <br /><br />The five languages are:<br />- Words of Affirmation<br />- Quality Time<br />- Gifts (or ""Receiving Gifts"")<br />- Acts of Service<br />- Pysical Touch<br /><br />Two helpful child development categories ( attachment and cognitive development) are also introduced because it is helpful to know where your child stands with regard to these categories. For children with unhealthy attachments, understanding their type of attachment helps the parent to implement these love languages to provide healing.<br /><br />These love languages are used between the parents and also between parent and child. For example with regard to physical touch, one father would rub the cheek of his child when in the NICU to provide physical contact and express love. When that disabled child began to talk, his son would beg to have his cheek rubbed as it would soothe him and let him know he felt loved.<br /><br />In summary, this is an resource for parents with disabled children. The entire premise of this text is to introduce these five love languages and then provide parents with examples of how others implemented them with their children and sometimes with each other. At the beginning there are tests the parent can take to determine their love language. Those tests are also available online.<br /><br />I believe this book is not only good for those who have disabled children but for any adult in a relationship or with a child. However, I did want more. I would have liked five full case studies on each of these love languages in addition to the many unrelated examples.",Positive
"At first I was not impressed with this book because the initial pages (up to about page 20) rambled on as sort of an advertisement as how this book would help the reader. I also had trouble understanding what he meant by conditioning until I read further.  Eventually, as I read on, it got better and better and now I love the advice within and understand why he used that word.<br /><br />I believe writing this text was incredibly cathartic for the author in addition to being filled with great advice for the reader. For instance, he had to learn to be his true self. Although, he does not specifically say when he came out as a gay man, it is obvious he was living a life that was not really his.<br /><br />He highlights many thought-provoking excerpts in this book. Here are two such thoughts:<br /><br />""It's amazing what insight comes when we stop long enough to listen and how fulfilled our path becomes when we use what we've found to live authentically.""<br /><br />""...one of life's most valuable lessons: to stop putting off till tomorrow what you have the opportunity to do today.""<br /><br />In summary, this text is food for thought and is designed to get the reader to live their life authentically, in the moment, be grateful for what one has, take care of yourself, excercise, eat right, etc., etc. Although this may seem like common sense, most of us do not follow this path because we are ""conditioned"" into being someone other than ourselves. From page 20 on, this text is a complete gem and an enjoyable read!",Positive
"This is a cute ""moments of love"" desk calendar for 2020.<br /><br />- It stands on its own by folding the front cover halfway around back and then connecting it with the invisible magnetic strip in the center of the back cover (photo 1).<br /><br />- Each page is perforated and can be cleanly ripped off when the day is over.<br /><br />- The comic takes up the entire page and the date is only on the bottom. There really is no room for notes.<br /><br />- Each day has its own page except for Saturdays and Sundays, which are combined on one page. Pictures 3 and 4 show a sampling of the comics on February 15/16 and May 18.",Positive
"The author, Susannah Charleson, is a Search and Rescue Volunteer (SAR) who worked mostly with her dog Puzzle on locating missing, lost, and deceased persons. She has recently gotten into Missing Animal Response (MAR) work and is training her dog Ace on locating missing, lost, and deceased pets.<br /><br />This book is a smattering of various interesting stories about her life and her rescue missions of various pets. She was brought up by two parents, who at a very young age, taught her to respect animals and lead by example in rescuing many homeless animals or owned animals who were just lost and needed help getting back home.<br /><br />The end of the book provides an excellent list of what to do if your pet goes missing and how to prepare for such an event.<br /><br />I learned that animals get loose when we think they never will. I also learned that making direct eye contact, calling out to them, or running after them actually does more harm than good and could result in getting them killed in traffic. She mentioned that many animals are found along the greenbelt which is the periphery of where land meets civilization. A lot of times animals are not far from home. Also, that wonderful pet at home acts very differently, if not aggressively when lost.<br /><br />This was an excellent and enjoyable read to me. Other than the minor grammatical errors typical of a pre-release book, this author has certainly matured in her writing style since I read her first pre-release book, ""The Scent of the Missing."" Overall, this is well done.",Positive
"René Redzepi is a Danish chef who co-owns Noma (now Noma 2.0), which is a restaurant in Copenhagen, Denmark.  He invited the author on his quest to discover the best culinary flavors throughout the world and to publish this book about the effort. These discoveries, such as the worlds best mole, came at a price. He closed Noma (1.0) in order to create pop-up Nomas in Japan, Australia, and Mexico.<br /><br />Most of this culinary story takes place in Mexico, whose eatable delicacies Redzepi loves. What I learned about this quest is the difficulty of foraging and procuring ingredients to make the best and most astonishing culinary delights possible.  The author is a gifted writer in being able to weave  a story that is somewhat lacking in substance but which I still found to be incredibly enjoyable. It is a journey of discovery of what the natural world can offer up that will excite our palate and also about the man and his disciples that formulate these culinary creations. The difficulty in finding superb ingredients and the stress associated with their use is front and center throughout this text.",Positive
"I ordered this book because I recently purchased a Ninja Foodi and it has an air fryer option besides being a pressure cooker, dehydrator, and slow cooker.<br /><br />This text is thin but has a good overview on the best air fryers to buy and why they like a particular type of air fryer. It does not mention the Ninja Foodi at all. There are about 13 recipes in this cookbook that I would make.  For this review, I decided to make the big Italian meatballs with zucchini noodles. It came out delicious and the prepared dish is shown in the last photo.<br /><br />However, as I started to cook the meatballs, I realized the Foodi does not go lower than 300 degrees for the air fryer option. The recipe calls for 250 degrees. I did keep checking the meatballs during cooking. Unfortunately, I overcooked them just little bit on the last cycle that called for 160 degrees. They just came out a tiny bit dryer than they should have. Nevertheless, I was more successful with cooking the zucchini noodles since that required 400 degrees. The end result was delicious.<br /><br />Note that the recipe called for salt and pepper but the amount of those two ingredients were listed in the text instead of the recipe so one has to be careful to read everything first.<br /><br />In summary, this is a good air fryer recipe book. However, it is not written for someone who has a Ninja Foodi because the temperatures on the Foodi do not go as low as some of the recipes call for. Of course, one can make adjustments and keep watch over the cooking cycles to approximate the necessary cooking times in this situation.",Positive
"This journal is usable in the sense that writing on the paper with pen or pencil works well. However, I consider this substandard because it is too vintage-looking for my taste.<br /><br />As is typical of a leather-bound journal, the paper is not replaceable. The pages have smudges on them throughout and sometimes lint and other stuff. The underside of the leather is poorly dyed looking as if it is dirty. The tie is just a string of leather and not set in a way that makes it intuitive to tie the book shut. The embossing on the outside is attractive, however.<br /><br />There are five sections that are ""stitched"" into the book. Each section has a centerfold string as can be seen in the fourth photo.<br /><br />The nine photos show the following in order:<br />1 - The attractive stitching on the binding and the outer leather embossing.<br />2 - The front of the journal and the only way I was able to tie it.<br />3 - A picture of the five sections.<br />4 - The centerfold leather string for each section.<br />5 - The blotchy spots typical throughout many of the pages.<br />6 - The light blotchy spots (on left page) and lint through certain pages of the book. It is hard to see in the photo but it is there.<br />7 & 8 - The  inside leather cover and blotchy dye work.<br />9 - The center dot is actually the tie string that is knotted in the center of the small front flap.<br /><br />In summary, this is a cheaply made journal and they succeeded in making this look dirty vintage and handmade from scrap. The exterior embossing of a tree design is attractive and so is the binder stitching. The leather is cheap and the paper is blotchy, dirty, and full of lint. This is definitely usable but not up to the standard I would expect of a leather-bound journal especially with the dirty blotches that appear on some pages. Since the intention here is to look vintage, I would say they over succeeded. I would not expect to pay more than $18 for this in its current condition. However, I personally do not care for it although others might find this very attractive with that ""found in the attic"" sort of treasure that has been laying around for years.",Negative
"The author starts each chapter by writing a letter to his baby daughter, which is very touching. What follows those letters, are small words of wisdom. Unfortunately, none of the quotes before page 42 resonated with me and many others throughout the book are equally cryptic. However, after page 42, the inspiring messages to his daughter and us increased exponentially. As a result, this book is a gem for those about thirty quotes I found that made perfect sense. If it were not for those messages, I would have been disappointed in this book.<br /><br />INSPIRING EXAMPLES:<br /><br />""Thinking big but acting small is the same thing as thinking small.""<br /><br />""Only do those things you want to do with whom you want to do them""<br /><br />""Dimming your light in sadness or empathy over the suffering of others doesn't help anyone""<br /><br />""Nothing you might ever do can ensure anyone else's happiness.""",Positive
"I read this book from cover to cover and most recipes seem very healthy to me but they include many ingredients and lots of spice and other aromatics.<br /><br />This is mostly a straight up recipe book with only an intro story and a descriptive paragraph preceding each recipe. There are many recipes that call for ingredients not normally in my cabinet such as preserved lemons, chermoula paste, harissa, etc. Nevertheless, I found several I could make with what I had on hand.<br /><br />I decided to make the Harira Soup because it looked delicious and wholesome.  There were 22 ingredients in this recipe but only 21 for me since I left out the cumin seeds as I dislike that spice immensely.  I attached a photo of most of the ingredients in this recipe. The soup came out absolutely delicious. It was very aromatic with a blend of wonderful flavors. I would definitely make this again and again and again (see last picture).<br /><br />This book also includes desserts, salads, etc. There is only one chapter dedicated to cooking in a tagine but unfortunately, most of those recipes call for a Dutch oven, slow cooker, etc. This is disappointing to me as a tagine is the cooking implement I think of for Morocco. Nevertheless, there are several recipes I might try one day in this book, no tagine necessary.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the selection I can choose from even though these recipes take time and are the furthest from bland. The fact that I also consider most of these dishes healthy is an added bonus.",Positive
"It pains me to give this book a two-star rating because it is well written and full of unusual recipes. However, it is written by an author who is part of the London Borough of Jam and is geared more for the U.K. market rather than U.S.<br /><br />First, all the recipes are in metric. This is not too much of a problem because I can go on the Internet and convert everything but it is an annoyance to someone who is not use to this.<br /><br />Second, most of the ingredients are impossible to find in my area of the US. Ingredients such as gorse flowers, gooseberries, elderflower heads, loquat, cicely leaves, angelica, green almonds, anise hyssop leaves, tayberry, boysenberry, ""peche de vigne"", blackcurrant leaves, jostaberries, green walnuts, mulberry, greengage, Dalmassine plums, quetsche plums, Uva Fragola grapes, Earl Grey with (or without) cornflowers, vincotto, etc., etc.<br /><br />Third, the preservation method listed is foreign to me. I am use to the Ball method of preserving where the glasses are boiled and then boiled again with the ingredients to seal the contents for storage.<br /><br />Fourth, some comments in the book had me scratching my head. For instance, on Page 106, the recipe for tomato jam says to use ""apple cider vinegar (preferably one that has a mother in it)."" What in the world does that mean? What mother?<br /><br />Fifth, for some hard-to-find ingredients, the author recommends growing them. This is great if you have land to grow them on and a green thumb but is not practical for many cooks.<br /><br />There are a few recipes that I might be able to find the ingredients for when the season is right. However, currently there is not one recipe that I would make that I have all the ingredients for nor are they easily found this time of year.<br /><br />In summary,  I think this jam recipe book is for the adventurous kind who have access to the ingredients that may be readily available in the UK or for those who love going on a treasure hunt. I do feel I will eventually make one or two recipes in this book, but overall this text will not be my go to jam book of recipes. It is a shame because it is a beautiful book and I believe the recipes will probably come out good based on what I read. If I do make any recipe, I will preserve using the Ball method and not the one described within the ""Five Seasons of Jam.""",Negative
"This cookbook is beautifully bound and the cover picture dish is so succulent and healthy looking that I wanted to eat the soup right off the page. However, this is where it all ends for me.<br /><br />I have been reviewing this cookbook on and off since early November and have read it from cover to cover. Except for the cover, very few of the dishes look appetizing to me in the photos.<br /><br />Second, practically every recipe calls for Thai chilies or some other hot spicy ingredient.<br /><br />Third, almost every recipe uses a lot of oil or is fried, including the one dish I made.<br /><br />Fourth, not every picture is captioned. As a result, most times I do not know what dish I am looking at because it is not usually on the page of the recipe.<br /><br />Fifth, for someone who practices ""mise en place"" (meaning I like to lay out ALL my recipe ingredients before I start cooking), one ingredient is always missing in the recipe. In both the dishes I made, water was an ingredient that was only mentioned in the narrative. It should have also been listed in the ingredient list.<br /><br />Sixth, most of the ingredients are hard to find in my area, like sawtooth herb, galangal, Shaanxi vinegar, Yunnan ham or Spanish Jamon Serrano (I had to substitute prosciutto for this), etc.<br /><br />Seventh, most households will have to buy new kitchen tools to cook these recipes, like a Chinese roller or dowel, wok that does not have a non-stick surface, etc.  I decided to use my non-stick wok because I did not want to buy another kitchen implement.<br /><br />There are only five recipes that I would ever make from this cookbook and that is because they do not require a spicy ingredient and are low in oil. I made two of the five recipes and they came out pretty good.<br /><br />Attached are photos of the fried rice with ham, potatoes, and peas and the bok choy and ginger soup (photos 4, 5, & 6) which was my favorite--simple and mostly healthy.<br /><br />In summary, based on the cover photo, I thought this cookbook would have healthy recipes similar to Vietnamese Pho. I was definitely wrong about that. This cookbook may be perfect for some, but I do not eat spicy food nor do I fry anything with oil. It is for this and the other reasons stated above, that this recipe book is not going to get much use in my house.",Negative
"I have mixed feelings about this book that I have been reading and reviewing for the last 35+ days. On one hand it is five stars because it is chock full of wonderfully rich recipes, two of which I made (pictured - Tortilla Espanola ala Michelle and Pots de Creme). On the other hand it is also full of great recommendations for essential kitchen tools but which are more for the slightly advanced cooks.<br /><br />I actually had to buy stuff, such as this [[ASIN:B0023PVZD6 Scanpan CTX 12-3/4-Inch Covered Chef's Pan]],  [[ASIN:B072BRFK2N HERBS DE PROVENCE]], and several other items in order to make the recipes because they were not part of my kitchen arsenal and I have a tremendous amount of cooking tools.<br /><br />The book starts out with which rolling pin is the best and moves on from there to recipes using a rolling pin and techniques on how to roll noodles, etc. She also provides cooking tips with some of the recipes, many of which I never heard of. For example, on troubleshooting slurry, you need a small amount of liquid with cornstarch whisked in instead of sprinkling it on which creates a lumpy slurry. Personally, I do not even know what slurry is and she does not explain it. It is apparently a semi-liquid mixture per my Internet search.<br /><br />I do wish she defined things more so the novice cook would understand what is meant. For example, when I was making the Pots de Creme recipe, she says to simmer until ""steam starts to wisp around the edges."" I had to assume it was when bubbles formed around the edge because my boyfriend and I never saw any steam around the edges.<br /><br />In summary, this is an absolutely fabulous book that is a great complement to a well-stocked cooking library. It is NOT for the novice cook but for one who is more seasoned or wants to become so. The recipes are stupendous and rich. My boyfriend was blown away by both of the ones I made. It has more recipes than tips, in my opinion. I also would have preferred pictures of some tools (like the spider she recommends; I did not even know what kitchen tool that was).  In addition, a glossary of some terms would be great as well. Nevertheless, the only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title of the book is not true to what is inside. It is more cookbook than anything and the tools are not for the home cook but are more for the more ADVANCED cook in my opinion. I also would expect a book with this title to start with utensils such as knives, forks, pots, and pans instead of rolling pins, sheet pans, cast iron, etc. in that order.",Positive
This is a remarkable recreation from historical accounts and the author's speculation of what happened when the John Rutledge sank on a voyage from Liverpool to New York in February of 1856. The author creates a narrative around historical accounts he gathered during his research. He used his imagination to effectively describe what experiencing this tragedy might have been like. Thomas W. Nay was the only survivor who was rescued by the ship Germania.<br /><br />The story sets the stage with a prologue about the lives of some of the crew before the John Rutledge set sail. Some parts of this narrative were a bit mundane but the remainder of the book was mostly riveting. I was impressed with the author's ability to  weave a tale around such a horrific tragedy that was typical in those times.,Positive
"I love to read health books and this one on adaptogens is in that category. Unfortunately, this text is really geared to select users.<br /><br />A herb has to be considered both non-toxic and safe for extended use to be called an adaptogen. Adaptogens are used to help the body resist physical, chemical, and biological stressors and have been used for centuries in China and India.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book, I never heard of an adaptogen. Only ginseng, astragalus, licorice, and nettle were ones I heard of and sampled before. The author provides a brief summary of many others such as ashwagandha, tulsi, jiaogulan, maca, rhodiola, shatavari, etc.<br /><br />I read this from cover to cover but there is not one recipe that I am interesting in trying now. There are only four recipes that I might consider trying in the future and they are the night garden sachets for improving sleep, raspberry & rhodiola chia yogurt for improving mental focus,  or matcha & peach chia seed pudding with gynostemma also for improving mental focus. The only recipe that comes close to anything in a cookbook is the roasted sweet potatoes with rosemary but even then that requires powdered rosemary and not the fresh kind.<br /><br />In addition, these herbs are not ones that I have access to nor are they always easily attainable. However, for those who are interested in making recipes or potions with these ingredients, this book is superb in its explanation and guidance. Besides  describing each herb, there are sections for all sorts of issues like improving mood, men's and women's health, immune function, hair/skin/nails, stamina/energy, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is both a good reference source, tutorial, and recipe book on adaptogens, but it is just not for me.",Positive
"The author lost one of her premature twin sons shortly after birth and this book is about her loss. Her story and grief process is written in a chaotic style, many times fluttering from one thought to the next with limited cohesiveness. However, this chaotic thought process will probably resonate with those who have experienced the loss of a child, especially a newborn. Some of her story I could relate to even though I never lost a child. The reader will understand what it is like to experience thoughtless comments from those who know nothing of her misery or who want to avoid thinking about it because it causes them pain. I can relate because when my best friend (who also happened to be an ex-boyfriend) committed suicide by hanging himself in his bedroom, I was treated to thoughtless comments by others such as &#34;wow that must have been a high ceiling.&#34; Of course, there are those who react appropriately, but that is less often the case.<br /><br />In summary, some mothers who have lost a newborn or young child will be able to truly feel that someone else has experienced what they are going through. However, not everyone will relate to the chaotic style in which this is written. It is not so much a succinct tale from beginning to end as it is several short stories with jumbled thoughts thrown in-between that really demonstrates the upheaval and utter sadness such a death imposes on the mother.",Positive
"I ordered this book thinking it was about detoxifying one's body from poor nutritional choices. However, this is a self-help book about accepting yourself and moving forward positively and without fear instead of striving for perfection.<br /><br />This text went from a 3-star book to a 5-star book as the story progressed. The first couple of chapters were about the author telling the reader that she was a perfectionist and that the text that follows will allow the reader to be detoxed from perfectionism. I thought I was reading an infomercial and kept hoping the author would keep her promise.  Eventually, she did.<br /><br />Once I got into this book, I loved it. She provides wonderful insights on how we can embrace our imperfect self and provides daily detox methods at the end of each chapter that we can work on. There were many quotes in the book that resonated with me and here are two of them.<br /><br />1 - Acceptance is not about ignoring our weaknesses, but instead requires a shift in how we react to our imperfections and mistakes.<br /><br />2 - She reiterates a quote from a therapist she knows, &#34;Forgiveness is not letting people off the hook (including yourself) for doing unforgivable things, but it is about unhooking yourself from the negative actions of the past so they do not affect your positive future.&#34;<br /><br />There are many excellent points in the chapters of this book. Self-acceptance is about balancing your strengths and doubts--be curious, be free from fear, live in the moment, focus on the positives, exercise for fun not for the scale, etc. etc.<br /><br />Overall, the is an enjoyable read once the reader gets a few chapters in.",Positive
"This is a nice academic calendar with several neat features and a couple I do not understand. If counting the ring binder, the dimensions are 7.5&#34; by 9&#34; and it is almost an inch thick.<br /><br />NEAT FEATURES<br />- There are monthly tabs for each weekly and monthly calendar sections.<br />- The monthly calendars have generous proportioned squares.<br />- There are quotes, etc. peppered on the bottom of some of the calendar sheets.<br />- There's a double sided pocket in front for storage.<br />- A property label is on the inside front cover.<br />- A holiday, reference (includes 2020 planning section, emergency numbers, etc.), and notes section are included.<br />- The notes section has perforated &#34;Post-It-sized&#34; sections for easy removal.<br />- This comes with an attached elastic band that can be used to keep the planner shut.<br /><br />FEATURES I AM UNCLEAR HOW TO USE OR DO NOT FIND USEFUL<br />- There are a couple of sheets of stickers in the back. I guess these can be used to highlight certain calendar entries.<br />- There's a habit tracker sheet in front of each month section. I'm not really sure what to do with this or even how to use it.  If I already have a habit, then it is well established and I do not need to track what day of the week I performed that task.<br /><br />Overall, I like this planner. The binder is a little bit sticky initially but after a bit of use, it turns easier. I think this is a good choice among many other good and competitively priced alternatives on the market.",Positive
"This is a British written story and so the writing style is a little different. A &#34;theatre&#34; is the operating room. A&E is Accident and Emergency in Great Britain, meaning the Emergency Department. In addition, I found the first chapter, which is a tale leading up to her nursing career, a slow and un-engaging lead into an otherwise great book about the author.<br /><br />The author is a nurse that works mostly with children. She spares no details when expressing what it was like for her. It is obvious she cares deeply about the patients she tends to and after reading this text, I walked away with a more in-depth view of what goes on behind the scenes in nursing. If I were considering a nursing career, this story would provide a very good idea of what it is like to care for others and the various atrocities they see daily. Overall, I enjoyed the story and in many cases felt like a fly on the wall assisting her with her duties.<br /><br />In her book, Christie says &#34;Promoting dignity in the face of illness is one of the best gifts a nurse can give.&#34;  Based on the story I read here, she certainly has met that standard.",Positive
"Thirty years ago, Jim and Jamie Dutcher set out to film and learn about wolves by creating a secluded and contained wolf camp below the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. For six years they studied these wolves until their permits ran out as a result of locals lodging anti-wolf complaints. Each chapter is alternately written by Jim or Jamie in a way that describes a particular wolf experience or set of behaviors. For example, I learned that wolves will not attack farm animals unless they are use to eating that type of meat. The authors told a story of wolves who are seen running in the same fields as cows without attacking them but yet will attack the deer in the same fields.<br /><br />It is clear from this text that wolves are emotional animals and the pack works as one cohesive unit for the safety of all. They grieve, play, and experience emotion just like we do. Even though the stories were matter-of-fact in some cases and not told in any particular consecutive timeline, I enjoyed learning about wolves through these authors' eyes.",Positive
"This is an excellent guide for guidance counselors and other coaches who need to help others evolve into great leaders. The take away for me is that great leaders must attain those skills not by being told what to do but by having them take part in the coaching process and being the ones who turn themselves into great leaders through effective coaching. It is important for those being coached not to be dismissed, ridiculed, etc. The coach must listen so that the coachee can grow. Evolving into a great leader is a lifelong journey both for the coach and the coachee.<br /><br />This book also highlights that coaches should not be too tied to a specific outcome (from those they coach) because they may be met with resistance. A leader should remember to LEAD (listen, empathize, appreciate, design).<br /><br />There is a lot of good advice in this book; however, to me it reads almost like a textbook. Although I enjoyed reading this (and I read it from cover to cover, even the Appendix), I feel this information is only one part of what is necessary to be an effective leader. The other part is to actually see someone put this into action and this book (the text and limited examples) did not resonate enough with me where I could visual how to take action effectively.",Positive
Lizzie Velasquez is a motivational speaker with a rare congenital disease that has resulted in immense ridicule and cruelty in her young life. Her book is a compilation of the importance of kindness interspersed with various tidbits of her own story. The intention of this book is to teach others not to bully someone else just because they are different. Her other intention is to instill a sense of acceptance of oneself and to show that one can be happy despite their circumstances.<br /><br />This is a lighthearted read and I enjoyed it.  I believe in her message immensely but that message was conveyed in a &#34;matter of fact&#34;  style. I truly feel that if there were more depth of emotion infused into this book her message would be so much more impactful.,Positive

Both he and I liked how these cards stimulated conversations and allowed us to think and get to know details about each other that we did not know even though we have been together for 15 years.<br /><br />Each card is the size of a tiny Post-It note at 1 inch x 3-1/2 inches. In this package are questions such as:<br /><br />- Thinking back to all the great TV series finales that you have seen over the years, which show do you believe had the best final episode?<br />- If snow could fall in any flavor, what flavor would you choose?<br />- Which age, when you turned it, was the most difficult for you to accept?<br /><br />Some questions made us think on the fly and make stuff up. This means that if we were answering this question again, we would give a different answer because we never actually thought about that particular question. There are some questions that were difficult to answer. For instance, I do not watch TV or movies much so I could not answer any questions related to the best movie sequel because I did not know any. One is encouraged to change up the questions if necessary.<br /><br />Overall, we found this both fun and entertaining and only got though part of each pack. We're saving the rest of the pack for the next vacation or time together.",Positive

"I am bewildered as to how to describe this book. I do not even understand the purpose of this text other than to say that the author describes macabre details as if reading a photograph. Almost every paragraph is a new &#34;experience&#34; for the reader.<br /><br />For example, in one paragraph the author writes about a kitten that was killed by a dog, that was then autopsied by the pet owner, and found to have internal organ damage. The author goes on to describe how the owner then photographed the dead kitten with sunglasses, a cigarette in its mouth, etc.<br /><br />In another paragraph in a different chapter, the author talks about someone who told her a story about his father who was shouting for help while drowning and his family laughed and ignored him because they thought the father was clowning around since he was a trickster. He drowned, of course. A few paragraphs later in the same chapter, is an excellent description of how waterboarding is done.<br /><br />The short narratives go on and on throughout the book. I just started reading this and stopped at page 30. I browsed other paragraphs in the book but it was more of the same disaster type stories (death, starvation, prison, etc.). This is not a book I want to read further. The subject matter is incredibly gruesome to me and the text is all over the place as the reader moves from one varied narrative to another. I do not feel I am learning anything at all from the text even though this is sadly a work of non-fiction.<br /><br />On the positive side, it is apparent from the bibliography that the author did a lot of research before producing this text. In addition, she writes exceptionally well but the narrative is just a compilation of one ghastly detail after another with no continuity in-between.  This is definitely not a page turner for me although a select few might consider it a masterpiece.",Negative
"It's been a couple of weeks since I got this guide and I'm almost done reading it from cover to cover a little each night.  This is more of a reference than book than reading material but I'm enjoying learning about (although not remembering) some of the most popular insects in North America. For most insects there's a picture of the adult and one picture of another form of that insect (such as the nymph, larva, eggs, adult male). Species,  range, some typical behaviors, and other facts are also listed.<br /><br />The body parts of each insect and spider are vividly described. Nevertheless, the main issue I have with those descriptions is that there is no diagram of the body parts being discussed. On the inside back cover of this book, there's a body part diagram of both an insect and spider. However, on the diagram for the insect, it shows leg, thorax, etc. Yet when describing the insects, the text uses words like pronotum, scutellum, elytra, petiole, chelicereae, scutum, etc. I would have loved to see the locations and diagrams of those because even if I read the glossary it was hard for me to visualize.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there's a lot to learn from this book. For instance, I had no clue that:<br /><br />- Companion planting nasturtium or tansy flowers can work to repel squash bugs<br /><br />- Using pesticides indoors on stink bugs is not recommended because their dead remains in walls and other inaccessible places can cause other insect pest infestation.<br /><br />- Winged termites in a home indicates an infestation.<br /><br />- Two-striped stick insects spray defensively and if it gets in humans or dogs eyes, it results in severe pain and temporary blindness. &#34;Even inhalation of the spray can cause considerable discomfort.&#34;<br /><br />- In 2021, brood X of seventeen-year cicadas will emerge in their range which includes (but is not limited to) New Jersey to northern Georgia.<br /><br />Had National Geographic included a representative sample of in-depth diagrams of insect parts for the various bugs that showed the location of all the &#34;body parts&#34; that were bolded in the text descriptions, I would have rated this five stars. Despite this oversight, I still love the book.",Positive
"Dilan Ellegala a neurosurgeon from the US who was born in Sri Lanka travels to Haydom Lutheran Hospital  in Tanzania as sort of a temporary medical missionary on a six-month leave. While there he realizes that visiting doctors come and go and their help is only momentary. He quickly understands that the only way to successfully assist these disparately poor and sick patients is to teach a Tanzanian medical officer who has an interest in surgery to perform brain surgery without a doctor's license. In the end, his first student Emmanuel Mayegga goes on to teach another student and each new student teaches others. Of course, there's the issue of liability of practicing medicine without a license but these people would die without help. Mayegga goes on to get his doctor's degree and eventually returns to Haydom as a &#34;legal&#34; doctor.<br /><br />In the midst of all this Dilan meets Carin Malek, a pediatrician from the Netherlands working in Haydom, who he falls in love with and marries. Although Dilan's goal of teaching others in Haydom has its starts and stops, in the end his idea to create an environment in which select Tanzanian medical officers could teach others brain surgery thrives to some extent.<br /><br />Dilan is a bit arrogant, slightly unstructured, and truly compassionate and his wife Carin has enough benevolence for everyone. I found this story an enjoyable read for many reasons. First, I traveled through parts of Tanzania on safari with a Massai chief and US guide. Reading about this area brings back memories even though I never heard of Haydom. Second, I love a story where someone is willing to make a difference in an unorthodox way. Third, although no such teaching would ever be allowed in the US, this story encourages the reader think about which is more ethical.  Is it better to let a patient die that you have the capacity to help only because you do not have a degree in medicine? Or, is it more ethical to operate anyway and give the patient a chance to live because you have the skill to heal but lack the medical degree to go with it. For me, it is more ethical to operate and take your chances than to not operate.  The whole premise and mission here is to save lives.",Positive
"Although this book is intended for those who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle and lose weight, the recipes are really for anybody. &#34;Cooking That Counts&#34; guides the reader to a healthier lifestyle by encouraging the cook to prepare real food and eat realistic portions.<br /><br />In the text, there's a section on a list of staples that should be in everyone's pantry and another section on the 1200 calorie 30-day meal plan that provide options to increase calorie intake if desired.<br /><br />I made two recipes so far and will be making a third.<br /><br />I made the &#34;Grapefruit, Avocado, and Prosciutto Breakfast Salad&#34; (page 60) for one which was quick to make. It took me 30 minutes which is 20 minutes over the time specified. The first picture is of the finished dish. Please ignore the pink stuff on the plate; I had trouble sectioning the grapefruit and wound up shredding it to pieces. Those are supposed to be grapefruit sections. That's my fault, not theirs.  Their picture in the book is so much better. The dish was flavorful and had an Asian flair with the addition of the sesame oil. I actually didn't like the dressing because the sesame oil is too strong and because I usually eat salad dry. Nevertheless, this was a good meal.<br /><br />I also made the &#34;five-bean chili&#34; (page 233) - see second picture attached. Note that there is no picture in the book of the completed recipe.  This dish took a couple of hours for me to make if I include prep time. All the bean and tomato ingredients are canned. It even calls for pre-chopped onions but I chopped my own. I did add an additional cup of vegetable broth than called for in the recipe because after adding the kale, it did not look as if there was enough liquid. The resulting dish was flavorful with a little bit of heat. It tasted both healthy and delicious.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE<br /><br />- I like that there is something for everyone in this book.<br /><br />- The recipes vary in size as some are for one and others are for eight people or servings.<br /><br />- The recipes really do not require a tremendous amount of time. Although not everything is from scratch, I consider the items that are in cans, like beans, good substitutes when one doesn't want to cook for hours or soak beans overnight. I do think it's a bit ridiculous, however, when the recipe calls for pre-chopped onion.<br /><br />- Some recipes are dairy free, gluten free, low carb, and vegetarian and noted as such. Also, all calorie, serving size, protein, cholesterol, etc. is noted at the end of each recipe.<br /><br />- Most recipes have beautiful pictures of the end result. However, note that some pictures include the recipe with additional sides. For example, pages 166 and 170 show meals that include additional calorie sides on the plate besides the recipe being made.<br /><br />MY MAJOR DISLIKE is that there are too many bar recipes for dessert (nut bars, energy bars, etc.)  I hate most bars and really don't want that as a dessert.  There are some other 150-calorie snack ideas on page 245 but I also wouldn't consider this dessert. There's definitely no indulgences in the dessert section.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great complement to a well-stocked cooking library that is geared for the health and calorie conscious.<br /><br />UPDATE Dec 25, 2016 - I made the &#34;3-ingredient pancakes&#34; (page 48) and it was delicious. It was more like dessert to me than breakfast (see third picture). They should have called it banana pancakes since that is the main ingredient. The picture in the book and my picture include additional toppings that are not part of the 1200 calorie plan. I added blueberries, walnuts, and a little bit of maple syrup. The book's picture includes the same except they apparently use a yogurt mixture instead of syrup.  Also, I did oil the non-stick griddle which is not specified in the recipe. The pancakes would have stuck otherwise and even were sticking a bit with the oil. All this adds to the calories. For those on the 1,200 calorie diet, all you would be able to eat is the pancakes without the toppings and no use of oil on the griddle.",Positive
"I purchased this book along with [[ASIN:1421414279 Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis]] because I wanted to learn more about RA.<br /><br />I like that this manuscript is short and touches on some RA symptoms, the importance of diet, etc. However, the main issue I have with this text is that it is POORLY written and POORLY edited. There was one sentence that just ended in the middle and the rest of the sentence was nowhere to be found. Another section mentioned &#34;Rolfing&#34; but said RA patients should NOT use this so it was not going to be discussed. In this case, the author should have at least written a sentence on what &#34;Rolfing&#34; is. (PS It is manipulation of the connective tissue; a type of massage.)  Also, after the first chapter every page had several formatting / editing errors such as no spaces between words, periods and commas where they don't belong, etc. The English is poor as well. I kept thinking this was the author's second language.<br /><br />Had this not been so poorly written, I would have rated this three stars. I learned a little from this book but nothing that made it worth the purchase.  However, all these errors and the disjointed text left me seething and so  disappointed that I wish I could get my money back.<br /><br />PS I attached a picture of the first two paragraphs on Page 80 as an example. The marked up areas are where the mistakes are and my attempt to correct them.<br /><br />UPDATE Oct 8, 2016: I contacted Amazon and they issued a full refund since this was totally unsatisfactory. They will investigate and the book went into the recycling bin since they did not want it back.",Negative
"This book covers several types of dementias (Alzheimer's disease, Lewy-body dementia, vascular dementia, & frontotemporal dementia); however, it predominately concentrates on Alzheimer's. Each chapter is designed to stand on its own but I read this cover to cover and find it is comprehensive. It talks about dementia tests, drugs, what scams not to fall for, day-to-day care, reality orientation and validation therapy for those with Alzheimer's, what to look for in a caregiver, etc. It focuses more on the caregiver side and soft skills associated with dementia and less on the scientific aspect of the disease.<br /><br />This is a comprehensive text but is not the only text that is needed in my opinion, especially if one has a dementia other than Alzheimer's. For instance, I have a friend who I suspect has Parkinson's with Dementia (PDD) of the Lewy body kind and I feel [[ASIN:193260393X A Caregiver's Guide to Lewy Body Dementia]] is a much better resource for that disease.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a great Alzheimer's for dummies book and a good demenia (of any other kind) for dummies book.",Positive
"I love memoirs of interesting people and I consider Tom Brokaw, as a news reporter, one of these people. Based on the title I surmised that he would delve deep into his life as well as educate the reader about his experience with Multiple Myeloma (MM), which is a relatively rare and incurable cancer of the plasma cells.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the narrative within is extremely superficial. On February 6, 2013 he turned 73 and it is at this point he starts the book talking about how he was diagnosed that summer. He then takes us through the Fall, Winter, Spring, and another Summer. Throughout the text, he has flashbacks where he lists all these famous people he interviewed and met and the circumstances surrounding those meetings. These flashbacks are interspersed with a light mention of his MM.<br /><br />What I did learn is that  he has a lot of money, a great wife, a great support system, superb medical care, and superb doctors. He also came across as wondering why someone who had such a successful life was cursed with this awful cancer when the people around him who did not take care of themselves were walking around disease free.<br /><br />I so wanted to love this memoir but I honestly learned little about him or his disease. I expected so much more.",Negative
"This author attacks the history of vanilla like a seasoned investigative reporter. Vanilla is produced in humid climates (it likes moist heat) such as Seychelles, Mauritius, Mexico, and Madagascar. Those who grow it, buy it, and sell it sort of live in a secret society. In many cases I felt like the author was describing the inside workings of a drug cartel. Chapter 12 about ice cream and perfume was my favorite chapter because it summed up vanilla's history and use.<br /><br />I purchased this book on a whim at &#34;bookoutlet&#34; because I love vanilla. Although I did find the story a bit flat sometimes, I enjoyed living vicariously through him in his &#34;search of the ice cream orchid.&#34;",Positive
"For the past 14 years an extremely close friend of mine has had many unexplainable symptoms (lack of smell, muscle cramping, choking, extreme abdominal pain with nausea after eating fiber or fat-rich foods, etc.) This November 2015 I noticed a resting tremor in the arm on his left side. This was the first time I suspected his issues were related to one disease which might be Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, I still dismissed this possibility because tremors can be related to other medical issues (one of which is benign) and he has only had this tremor three times. Periodically over the past several months I noticed him walking slower, a frozen facial expression, and his right hand curled in front of him as if he had a stroke. On Dec 5, 2015 he really exhibited the slow walking, frozen face, and curled hand and he took forever to dress that morning. Later that evening I became certain (in my opinion) that he has PD due to his telling me about a change in his handwriting which I did not witness. Unfortunately, he refuses to go to the doctor or seek medical help from a neurologist even when I told him I believe he has PD. On extremely rare occasions he'll go to see a particular specialist for whatever ailment is almost killing him at the moment. As a result, since December 2015 I've completely immersed myself in learning about PD with some cursory investigation of illnesses that exhibit Parkinson-like symptoms because I wanted to be sure I was on the right track.<br /><br />Besides searching the Internet for information, I purchased seven (7) books on Parkinson's Disease (PD) of which this book is one. My review is written from the perspective of someone who does not have PD but wants to learn about what the signs of PD are, what a person's life will be like, what are their challenges, what they should do about it, what is their life expectancy, etc. This book is in the list below. I've listed the books in the order of value to me and not in the order that I read them. I also put the copyright date of each book in parenthesis as well as my star ranking based on its usefulness to me and a short few sentences of what the book was about. If I had PD myself, I would rank them in a different order. I posted the same review to each one of these seven (7) books. At the end, I wrote a summary of what I think about PD and listed seven (7) other books I may one day buy and read.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0470073950 Parkinson's Disease For Dummies]] (c 2007) (4.5 stars) - Although this book does not have the latest developments or information on PD or Lewy Body disease (dementia included), it was invaluable in helping me understand what PD is in the most simplest terms. It helped me understand what to look for in a person with PD and what challenges they face. Since we are in 2016, the information on treatment is somewhat outdated. This book is great for someone who suspects they have PD or just got diagnosed because it clarifies symptoms in easy-to-understand language. It's a great resource for the newly diagnosed PD patient and those preparing for their first appointment. It also has information on Young Onset Parkinson's Disease (YOPD) and a chapter (sections of which I skipped over) full of exercises for the PD patient.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0446678902 What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM): Parkinson's Disease: A Holistic Program for Optimal Wellness]] (c Feb 2003) (4 stars) - This is like a textbook on Parkinson's disease with case studies from actual patients and information on alternative therapies such as acupuncture. This book appears to outline all the symptoms of Parkinson’s, including ones not in other books such as Seborrheic dermatitis and stuttering (which is also in Wilson's disease). This book discusses everything from A-Z, like complementary medicine (homeopathy, acupuncture, etc.), issues for caregivers, etc.  Case studies are interspersed throughout the text to give the reader a general idea of a PD person's experiences. It even mentions Mucuna pruriens which is a bean sold in supplement form and has high levels of levodopa that could be of help to PD patients--of course, only take this with supervision of your doctor.<br /><br />[[ASIN:193260393X A Caregiver's Guide to Lewy Body Dementia]] (c 2011) (5 stars) - this broadened my horizons about PD because it described the symptoms related to two very similar diseases and was co-written by someone whose spouse had dementia with Lewy bodies. PD is a Lewy Body disease where abnormal proteins show up on the part of the brain that controls movement. However, it is closely associated with Lewy Body Dementia that has abnormal proteins on the cognition part of the brain.  Both diseases have many of the same symptoms and depending on which symptoms appear first that determines what the disease is called. It is either dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's Disease with Dementia (PDD). The diagnosis is critical because medications for one disease can have adverse effects on those with the other disease or on those with Alzheimer's. Some DLB patients are misdiagnosed with Alzheimer's and those medicines are contraindicated in most cases for them. It was this book that helped me realize the symptoms I was seeing was the same with my friend and also easily explained what a caregiver needs to do.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1630261297 Living Well with Parkinson's]] (second edition) (c 1991, 2005) (5 stars) - This book was originally written by a woman who had Parkinson's Disease but who died on November 25, 1998 from a heart attack unrelated to PD. It was revised in 2005. This book is phenomenal in my opinion because it supplied me with an excellent narrative of what it was like to live with Parkinson's and how to make that life worth living. The chapter on &#34;Medications and Therapies&#34; provides a list of diseases that can resemble PD. The chapter on &#34;Is There Life With Parkinson's&#34; is a positive narrative on how the author lived very well with the disease.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1478325844 Parkinson's Humor - Funny Stories about My Life with Parkinson's Disease]] (c2012) (4 stars) - is a lighthearted book written by someone who has PD. The book, although not very funny to me, educated me on what day-to-day life is like to live with PD. For instance, Beverly mentioned how sometimes she felt starched when describing the rigidity PD patients experienced. Except for [[ASIN:1630261297 Living Well with Parkinson's]], this book was the only other uplifting book.  All the others books were way too serious and sobering. At a time when I am new in trying to understand PD and PDD, reading a text like this or the one above was critical especially since I was overdosing on the subject. This book provided the mental break I needed, was slightly educational, and an extremely easy read.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0671768190 Parkinson's Disease: The Complete Guide for Patients and Caregivers]] (c 1993) (3 stars) - this book is similar to [[ASIN:0446678902 What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM): Parkinson's Disease: A Holistic Program for Optimal Wellness]]  but it's 10 years earlier so the information is dated. For example in one chapter on how to cope with Parkinson’s there's a suggestion to use a Dictaphone if you can't write.  It has a short first section on symptoms of the disease and then goes into history, treatment, etc. There are three sections, however, that I found worthwhile. The Chapter on &#34;The A to Z Guide to Symptoms and Side Effects,&#34; &#34;Planning Your Financial Future,&#34; and &#34;Diseases That May Resemble Parkinson's Disease&#34; which is in the Appendix II are invaluable.  One thing I did not like about this book is that it was very negative describing more than once about the disabling effects of PD and how you have get your affairs in order, etc. Except for the three worthwhile chapters, I feel I did not need to purchase this book to get the information I was looking for.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0374116172 Brain Storms: The Race to Unlock the Mysteries of Parkinson's Disease]] (c 2015) (4 stars) - the author is actually a PD patient and this book covers the most recent research on PD.  It was not as helpful to me because it talked more about the latest developments in the search for a cure as well a brief glimpse at tests and drugs for PD patients. If I were a person with PD, then this book would probably be second in value in my list. For me, I could have done without purchasing this book.<br /><br />In summary, what I discovered is that a PD patient does not die from their disease and they can have a normal life expectancy. PD is a slowly progressive disease, that is not usually hereditary, and which affects each patient differently. Not all PD patients have visible tremors. The disease definitely changes the patient's life and the lives of those closest to them but it sometimes does this for the better because the patients re-evaluate their lives and how they want to spend their time. For many, the disease will be an inconvenience that the patients and caregivers can learn to live with. There are no tests that can definitely determine someone has PD while the person is alive. A definitive diagnosis can only be made with post-mortem brain analysis.  PD is determined via a process of elimination of testing for other similar diseases, observing arm muscle reactions during a test a doctor may try, and observing how the symptoms respond to Carbidopa / Levodopa drugs. It is critical that patients seek help immediately and partner with a doctor (or several doctors such as physical therapists, speech therapists, etc.) to seek a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.  At the early stages of PD, no drug therapy may be involved; it might me more of a wait and see approach.  The positive attitude of the patient along with eating right, exercising, partnering with a healthcare team, and having a good support network provides the best outcome for the patient to have a fruitful life with only some limitations and modifications.<br /><br />Please understand that no one book provided all the information I needed or wanted. I discovered information has to come from several sources, including the Internet and PD support groups. For instance, one PD symptom not mentioned in any of these books is gastroparesis. I found that one by searching the Internet with the word Parkinson's and abdominal cramping with nausea and the likes. I did these searches years ago, but at that time I did not suspect PD so Parkinson’s was not part of the search criteria. I do hope my friend will seek the help of a neurologist, detail all his symptoms, and let me tell the neurologist what I have been seeing.  Could I be wrong about believing that my friend has PD. Absolutely, I could be wrong; even doctors misdiagnose patients.  However, after reviewing Internet sources for the other diseases mentioned in these books, the only other diseases that come close with his symptoms are a brain tumor or Wilson's disease. However, with Wilson's disease his eye doctor would have noticed the copper ring (known as Kayser-Fleischer Ring) around his cornea during his eye exam.<br /><br />Although I am on PD overload, below are seven (7) other books (not listed in any particular order) that I might purchase in the future to learn more. The first one is on a disease with very close PD symptoms and the other six are on PD or a person’s experience with PD.<br /><br />1.

"When I was 12, I saw my first bat &#34;sleeping&#34; on a box in the barn at a camp I was staying at. Despite the negative things I heard about bats, I just fell in love from a distance and always wanted to hold one. I have never seen another bat nor have I held one. As with my fascination, this book reminds me of one boy's fascination with bats that has turned into a lifelong career.  The author is addicted to finding them, photographing them, and advocating for them. Each chapter is a different story of his exploits. I honestly don't know how this scientist is alive today as he's gotten himself into many precarious predicaments such as getting his vehicle stuck in quicksand, temporarily losing major lung capacity as a result of an ammonia-filled cave, etc.<br /><br />I enjoyed all his escapades and the lengths he would go to in finding elusive and not-so-elusive bats. Although, this text is a little educational with some tiny bat facts it is really more like the author's trip diary told in an engaging manner.<br /><br />One serious flaw is that there is not even a single picture or centerfold of photos in the entire book. He talks so much about the extreme difficulty of photographing some bats for National Geographic and how beautiful they are that I wanted to see them. The only photo is the un-captioned cover picture but I have no idea what kind of bat it is.<br /><br />Most pre-release books will have blank pages where photos are going to be printed. Therefore, I suspect no photos will be included in the final edition because no such pages exist in my pre-release copy. I think that is a shame because I wanted to view at least one picture of each bat he went searching for and found. This is my only disappointment with this otherwise enjoyable book.",Positive
"I enjoyed reading ""Fueled by Failure.""  I read years ago that ""success is failure in disguise"" and I've always believed that.<br /><br />There are many publications that try to teach people how to succeed by employing various principles just like there are many diet books that teach people how to lose weight. However, what a book teaches has to be sustainable.  This tiny booklet takes a no-nonsense, truthful, sensible, sustainable, achievable, and common sense approach to success.<br /><br />Jeremy Bloom briefly describes his failures and success as an Olympic skier, NFL player, CEO, and philanthropist and intertwines his philosophy with how he succeeded.  It's easy for one to think that because he came from a wealthy and supportive background that success came easy.  However, just because certain things are easier as a result of a person's ability or status in society does not mean that I or anyone else cannot succeed.<br /><br />First of all, each person gets to define what success is for them. Each person controls their destiny and happiness.  Then it's important to:<br />- Create a variety of goals and work toward them.<br />- Take time to grieve the failures and set a deadline to move on.<br />- Reduce distractions (stay focused on what you want to master; focus on all pieces of the journey; not just the end goal).<br />- Keep trying and learn from your mistakes.<br />- Don't define yourself through other people (be intrinsically inspired).<br />- Find a balance.<br />- etc.<br /><br />Besides discussing how to turn failures into success, the author also focuses on how to succeed in business, such as:<br />- Hire leaders not victims.<br />- Work for someone else first (""lose someone else's money before your own"").<br />- Be honest in business. This means not only focusing on the good but also making the team aware of the bad.<br />- etc.<br /><br />In the final chapter he talks about leaving a legacy (meaning do for someone else and not yourself).<br /><br />In summary, this is more like a pamphlet on how to turn failure into a success than a book. There are no earth shattering principles or secrets discussed. It's just plain common-sense to me.<br /><br />Don't have regrets. As the author states, ""Today is the youngest you'll ever be."" Dream, seize opportunity, determine what success means to you, dust yourself off when you fail, and then keep going for it.  Everyone has the ability to succeed no matter who they are or what support they have.  I truly believe that. I know a few people who have succeeded despite incredible odds without family or monetary support.<br /><br />Although the author briefly covered several topics (success in life and business and leaving a legacy), I enjoyed the pep talk. This book reminded me of a diet book that someone should write, which is consume fewer calories than  you expend, eat healthy, and exercise daily--no gimmicks, no recipes, just plain common sense.",Positive
"The title of this book led me to believe that this would be more [[ASIN:0060817097 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]] than a memoir about the author who marries and winds up with two stepchildren and a stepdog.  This memoir is 40% about the dog and 60% about the marriage.  Although I strongly feel that when you marry someone you accept them and their family (and yes that includes the dog) as a package deal, the author is of a different opinion when it comes to the dog. I really loved this book and the way Mireya tells her story. She is sometimes funny in describing the situation with Eddie the dog and her narrative is thought-provoking when describing the challenges she faced as a result of marrying someone who was already divorced and with a ""family"" of three. This was an easy read and just an overall enjoyable book.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this four stars is because the title is a bit misleading and led me to believe this was all about a dog.  However, it is a lot more than that but in a good way!",Positive
"I'm very fond of cookbooks that focus on one ingredient.  Since I love oatmeal and eat steamed groats for breakfast almost every morning, I wanted to know what more I could make with this one ingredient (besides oatmeal cookies using rolled oats).<br /><br />This book does not disappoint. Besides breakfast items there are granolas and bars, soups, desserts, drinks, and other uses for oats such as making my own soothing bath. What I also like about this book is that the calories, protein, carbs, fat, sodium, and fiber are listed for every food recipe. However, serving sizes are NOT listed in almost all cases.<br /><br />I use a steamer all the time to cook most of my food, so I was indeed surprised that steaming was not included as a cooking method. Then again, not every book can be absolutely complete.  Also, over 10 recipes call for stevia which is a sugar substitute. Personally, I'm not fond of its use and will not cook or bake with it, so that was a disappointment to me.  However, this book has enough other recipes for me to experiment with and I can always add table sugar.  I would have liked the recipe to include the comparable amount of table sugar and other ingredients that could be used instead of stevia but that was not done.<br /><br />Despite the above, I think this is a great cookbook on one of my favorite foods (OATMEAL). I tried the healthy chickpea veggie soup and it came out delicious. This recipe called for nutritional yeast and I never heard of that before as it differs from regular yeast.  I had to go to a specialty store to buy it. I bought the [[ASIN:B002863BIW Bragg Nutritional Yeast Seasoning, Premium, 4.5 Ounce]] since I could not find [[ASIN:B000WLCHDA Bob's Red Mill Large Flake Yeast, 8 oz]].  I used groats instead of the steel-cut oats. Since I used the longest cooking times, using the long-cooking groats did not impact the recipe any.  My boyfriend and I both ate a couple of bowls of the soup and we loved it.",Positive
"I already own the [[ASIN:B00000IWH9 Scrabble Deluxe Turntable Game]] which I purchased on Amazon in the early 2000's for less than $50 (unlike the exorbitant $179.99 price listed as of this review).  What I like about that game version is that it has raised squares on the board (in the form of a grid) that allows the tiles to be seated but not locked in place.<br /><br />This [[ASIN:1223063151 Tile Lock Scrabble]] board is not much different with regard to the ""locking"" feature except that there are 4 raised nibs at the corners of each square into which the tiles get placed.  The tiles DO NOT lock in place; they are just restricted from excessive movement.  Obviously, my other board is a little over double this size.  This board only measures 10 inches on all sides so it's closer to a travel or portable size. Besides the plastic board, a cloth bag holds all 100 tiles and four tile racks are included.<br /><br />There are only two things I do not like about this particular version.  The biggest disappointment is that the rubber feet are not at the edges of the board. This means when the game is being played, the board can be easily tilted if someone leans on any one corner because the feet only support the center of the board. The second thing is that the game is mislabelled because the tiles DO NOT LOCK in place but they stay seated well (or are prevented from excessive movement) as long as the board is not tipped. These were the only two items that kept me from loving this version and rating this five stars.  Other than this, I really really like [[ASIN:1223063151 Tile Lock Scrabble]]. I also think its competitively priced at $24.99 but that is the absolute max that I would pay for this version.",Positive
"The author raises orphaned black bear cubs and reintroduces them into the wild.  ""Out on a Limb"" is a book about his observations of these reintroduced bears and wild bears in nature.  He is a non-scientist and learns about the black bears through what I call the ""school of hard knocks."" This means he bases his observations on common sense and builds upon his knowledge through extensive behavioral observations.<br /><br />Squirty is his main subject and is the cub he raised into adulthood and released.  Since she is still living into her teens, he has been able to learn about the black bear language and what the ""huhs"" and ""grunts"" mean.  He also learned a lot about bear social etiquette from her and wild bears as well. For instance, since food sources are sporadic and not evenly dispersed in a bear's territory, bears create sort of an ""informal contract"" whereby they will share their bounty with other bears from outside their range in an expectation that when their food is scarce they can then be allowed to forage in that other bear's territory where food may be plentiful.<br /><br />The author observed that Squirty treats him like any other bear and all the bears he worked with have made a continuous effort to mold his behavior to their benefit.  For instance, he has experienced the typical ""gestures, message bites, swats, false charges, mock bits, scent marks, and vocalizations"" (from gentle to explosive attacks) that were all done in an effort to have him ""conform to their wants and needs."" In fact the bites he has received from some bears, in his opinion, are the result of those bears treating him like a bear and biting back as they would to reprimand another bear.<br /><br />In one instance I do question the author's observation. For instance, he believes bears can count. He believes this because Squirty always walked away after he gave her a full sleeve of 12 Oreos. As an experiment on several occasions, he decides to give Squirty only 10 or 11 of the 12 Oreos that came in the package.  If he didn't produce the additional cookies she would look for them herself. Therefore, he believes she can count. However, the question he did not answer for me is that perhaps she could smell that there were more Oreos left and that is why she looked for more.  I'm curious if he accounted for that scenario.<br /><br />Despite this possible oversight, I do agree with the author that the commonsense observations by ordinary people of their pets may in some cases be well ahead of the scientific world and its need for controlled experiments.  Mt. Kilham approaches his observations that way.<br /><br />Black bears have a complex social system that, in the end, the author believes holds clues to our behavior.  In the chapter ""what bears can teach us,"" he compares various aspects of bear behavior to human society and tries to explain how we evolved from primitive to modern society. Of all the chapters in this book, this was my least favorite.  Nevertheless, it was food for thought. I certainly agree that the best decisions are made under the pressure of survival and perhaps in our artificial and technological world with abundant food, resources, and overload of information and misinformation we are behaving badly.<br /><br />I was most surprised by the information in the last chapter where he says to stare a nuisance bear down and walk toward it if you want to keep the bear off your property.  Also, he says not to raise your voice or wave your arms when encountering a bear on the trail but to speak softly to it and not be afraid or look like a threat.  Personally, I have only had one black bear encounter with three bears in the wild.  My boyfriend and I found ourselves no more than 25 feet from a mother bear and her baby cubs.  By the time I spotted the family, the cute cubs were a couple of feet up the base of the tree and the mom was sitting below it looking at us.  I was totally unafraid and wish I had a camera.  However, I calmly walked away without incident.  I was surprised but after reading the last chapter in this book, I now understand that a mom with cubs is not as much of a threat as we all make it out to be.  Of course, such encounters should be avoided, but it does not mean such an encounter will result in injury or death.  I did not heed the advice I was taught which is to scream and act larger than the bear.  Instead I stayed calm, spoke softly, and walked away. I was also unafraid and it worked wonders in this situation. This makes me believe Mr. Kilham's advice might be right on target.<br /><br />PS The cute pictures in the centerfold are a plus! This book would have been 5 stars for me if it had not been for that chapter on ""what bears can teach us"" which seemed so out of place in an otherwise great narrative on the author's personal experience with black bears.",Positive
"Genetics plays a part in more than just inherited diseases.  However, this book is a compilation of essays told from the viewpoint of those who either have or their children have a genetic disease such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, Crohn's disease, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), BRCA1 & 2 (breast cancer), Schizophrenia, etc.<br /><br />Through these stories I learned that most people with Alzheimer's die of pneumonia, many Down syndrome children usually end up with Alzheimer's, and the Schizophrenia gene can be traced mostly to Ireland.<br /><br />There are 16 personal stories. Some are clearly written, such as Isabel and Anabel's story on what it was like to live with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Other stories are not as well told or appear to ramble a bit in a nonsensical way. Either the disease was not described or the story vacillated between past and present or used technical jargon to the extent that I found it confusing to follow. For example, the first story told by Kelly who had Huntington's disease never bothers to describe what that disease is really about. I think the author should have prefaced each story with what each disease was so there would be a frame of reference.<br /><br />On the other hand, some stories disturbed me.  There were a few stories of families with a strong possibility of passing their family disease onto their children who decided to have children anyway knowing the suffering it would cause that child.  Of course, having children is a personal choice but I was saddened by the choice they made. In some cases, families just kept quiet or ignored the possibility that they had a disease; that also was disturbing to me because the choice to stay ""unaware"" of such a disease does not make one innocent.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I give ""The Story Within"" 3.7 stars.  The essays enabled me to get into the mind and daily life of those who have a family history of genetic disease.",Positive
"""Raw, Quick & Delicious!"" is a beautifully compiled recipe book of various dishes made with raw food. Raw food is a diet that contains whole nuts, seeds, legumes, and grains that are considered unprocessed and generally not heated past 105 degrees F.<br /><br />I selected this book with the misguided thought that assembling (it's not really cooking to me) and eating a raw food recipe would not be much different from my steaming and eating an entire plate of various vegetables for dinner which is something I regularly do. Well, I could not be more wrong.<br /><br />First, most of the recipes are eaten cold and uncooked.<br /><br />Second the ingredients are high glycemic because the ingredients are processed by chopping, slicing, grating, pureeing, juicing, or liquefying.<br /><br />Third, the ingredients are not always low cholesterol because some recipes call for coconut oil or coconut butter.<br /><br />Fourth, several recipes called for ingredients that are not stocked in my kitchen such as coconut oil and coconut butter, hemp seed, wheat-free tamari, raw agave nectar, and sheet raw nori.<br /><br />Fifth, about 40 pages are dedicated to smoothies, drinks and juices and 13 pages to dressings. Also, about 13 pages are allocated for ""in the pantry"" recipes that consists mostly of sauces and dressings (8 sauces/dressings to 7 other recipes).<br /><br />I decided to make the ""shred-me-up-slaw."" I found this recipe easy to make and it tasted pretty good. However, since I'm not use to a raw food diet, I should have eaten it as a side salad and not a main meal because I started to feel nauseous during the last couple bites. There are only about three other recipes that I would make in this book such as the chunky tomato marinara sauce, the avocado cucumber hand rolls and perhaps the lime, tomato and avocado chile.<br /><br />Having read through the entire introduction and scanned the recipes, I know this type of eating is not for me. However, I do feel this is an excellent recipe book for those who are into raw food and I cannot discount this book just because my personal tastes do not prefer this type of diet.<br /><br />I took off one star only because the title of the book is misleading. The book title claims 5 ingredients in 15 minutes or less but this is not always technically true. The author does not count the salt or water ingredients mentioned in the recipe since everyone has these in their house. Also, if a recipe relies on one of his ""in the pantry"" recipes, then he counts the ""in the pantry"" item as one ingredient. This means if the ""in the pantry"" item was not previously prepared, there would be two recipes required taking 15 minutes each in order to complete the meal.<br /><br />Although this is definitely not a book for me, that is no reflection on the quality of this guide. Personally, I feel this book is excellent for raw food lovers. The introduction provides details on what tools are used in a raw food kitchen such as a cutting board, mandoline, high-powered blender, etc. The recipes are explained well, the few pictures provided in the book are gorgeous to the point that I wanted to eat the recipe or ingredient shown right off the page. I particularly loved the look of the lime, tomato and avocado chile and the avocado cucumber hand rolls.",Positive
"""Lean In"" is a superbly written book.  In my opinion, it is also highly controversial because the main premise of the book focuses on the general stereotypes that exist for women versus men.  By stereotypes I mean the following as quoted from the book all of which are true in general:<br /><br />- ""Women lower their own expectations."" ""....women face a battle from within.""<br /><br />- ""Professional ambition is expected of men but is optional--or worse, sometimes even a negative--for women.""<br /><br />- ""From the moment we are born boys and girls are treated different.""<br /><br />- ""When a man is successful, he is liked by both men and women.  When a woman is successful, people of both genders like her less.""<br /><br />- ""One miscalculation that some women make is to drop out early in their careers because their salary barely covers the cost of child care.""  The author believes staying in the workforce reaps more benefits later on even if you are in essence working for nothing by having all your money go to child care.<br /><br />- The author quoted a study that proved that ""Exclusive maternal care was not related to better or worse outcomes for children.  There is, thus, no reason for mothers to feel as though they are harming their children if they decide to work.""<br /><br />- The author mentions how a Google search for ""Facebook's male CEO"" returns the message ""No results found.""<br /><br />- Referring to women, Sheryl says ""It's up to us to end the self-fulfilling belief that `women can't do this, women can't do that.""<br /><br />Sheryl also provides some valuable advice that is good for everyone, not just women, such as:<br /><br />- ""We each have to chart our own unique course and define which goals fit our lives, values, and dreams.""<br /><br />- ""Authentic communication is not always easy, but it is the basis for successful relationships at home and real effectiveness at work.""<br /><br />- ""Emotion drives both men and women and influences every decision we make. Recognizing the role emotions play and being willing to discuss them makes us better managers, partners, and peers.""<br /><br />Like Sheryl, I also believe more women in leadership will change the workforce and increase pay and other equality. So why, then, if I think this book is so truthful and great did I give it four stars?  It's because:<br /><br />- The author pits men against women and in today's society we should be beyond that approach.  Yes, what she states is true in many cases; however, I shun stereotypes and prejudices when I can so that they do not become a self-fulfilling prophesy.  For example, many years ago I witnessed a woman walk into a packed meeting room who had an impressive and very intellectual and powerful presence.  I said to myself ""This is someone I would love to know."" She appeared to be very sure of herself and exuded high self-esteem.  I found out she was a lawyer.  However, at every meeting, she told the audience how she was discriminated against because she was black.  Although, it may have been true, after the third meeting with her all I could see was that she was ""black"" and her powerful appearance and impressiveness were lost to me. I did not even notice she was black when I first met her. I no longer had a desire to know her because she could not see past the discrimination.  In my opinion if people treat you differently because you are a woman, or black, or Chinese then find someone who will respect you for who you are.  By making it a mission to point out the stereotypes, I believe it leads to a self-fulfilling prophesy that you will be discriminated against.<br /><br />- Sheryl also does not broach the subject that different opportunities exist for different people, thereby limiting how far someone can go depending on if they are very poor or lack any support system.<br /><br />- Sheryl also does not make the case that a woman's will to lead may be hindered by genetics or cultural differences.  Yes, we can strive to overcome them and we should strive to overcome them, but it is not only about men versus women.<br /><br />If Sheryl focused more on her story instead of perpetuating the underlying male and female stereotypes, I would have given this book five stars.<br /><br />Here is my advice to both women and men alike:<br /><br />- Cultivate an incredible passion for more than one area of your life and move forward with an urgency others do not comprehend.  Life is like dinner on a plate with entrées and sides; if one only has an entrée (let's say it is work) and that disappears, then there is nothing left to sustain you. It's important to have balance where possible (family, friends, pets, work, hobbies, volunteer activities, church, travel, etc.), so that when one area of life fails, the other area supports the weight.<br /><br />- Live nothing but an honorable life and adopt the motto ""be good to yourself and others"" and ""remember you are making memories, so make them good ones.""<br /><br />- Have faith in yourself.  Believe ""you can"" and if ever you think ""you can't,"" say to yourself ""I can"" until you actually believe it.  In essence, be your own best cheerleader. You are what you believe.  If you think you can't, you won't; if you think you can you will.<br /><br />- Be an optimist; pessimism only brings you down.<br /><br />- Don't let others tell you what is best for you as you know they are looking at your situation from their own reality. Take their advice if you think it is good advice but only after you evaluate what effect that advice will have on you.<br /><br />- Do not let naysayers get you down.<br /><br />- Seize any opportunity that is in your best interest.<br /><br />- Whatever you do, DON'T QUIT! Success is failure in disguise and as mentioned in the ""Don't Quit"" poem ""many a failure turns about, when he might have won had he stuck it out.""<br /><br />- Remember you can't change anyone but yourself, so accept what you cannot change but work to change yourself when needed and embrace that change.<br /><br />- Finally, realize that stereotypes do exist, but do not give in to them.  You can rise above that. About 15 years ago a male colleague asked me to jumpstart his car because I had the cables to do so and he really did not know how. Had I ""leaned in"" to the stereotypes I doubt he would have had the courage to ask me for help.<br /><br />After reading this book, I can honestly say I would not do anything differently.  I'll continue to jumpstart my own car but will also continue to tell my boyfriend he was born with the ""barbecue gene,"" not because he really was but because I do not to like inhaling the smoke from the grill.",Positive
"This is a very thin book that's a very quick read. I read this in a little over one hour.  It's about one woman's quest to find out where her cat Tibby was for the 5 weeks he went missing written in a very lighthearted and silly way.<br /><br />She uses different methods to track down his previous whereabouts such as a camera, GPS, psychic, animal communicator, etc.  The story is both funny at times and very silly at other times.  The book ends with a message of how we often think of technology first before thinking of a simpler way of finding out what we want.<br /><br />I did enjoy this story.  However, based on the title I thought it was a book about a lost cat whose owner uses GPS technology to find her cat--not so.  Instead she uses this and other technology and methods AFTER her cat returns home.<br /><br />I think many cat lovers can relate to the author's feelings and enjoy this lighthearted read. I also think some young adults would have fun reading this.",Positive
"""In Bed with the Badge"" is about a battered wife (and family) who shot her husband in self-defense as told by her children with excerpts from various friends and family. Her husband was a retired New York Police Officer.<br /><br />After the shooting, the children examined their mother's life in an attempt to outline the anatomy of abuse.  They detailed the signs that were part of their parents failed relationship in the hopes that others who are in abusive relationships will see those signs and get out.  There was proof that the husband was controlling, exhibited odd behaviors, was verbally abusive, and forced them to be isolated from their family and friends in addition to other signs.<br /><br />What came through loud and clear to me in this book was how the wife's fear of being killed and putting her children in danger kept her in the relationship; not to mention that she couldn't call the police because ""he was the police."" ""The slide into dysfunction is usually just that; not something that happens overnight, but more of an invasive, malignant, creeping vine that takes root and silently takes over.""  This is one sentence in the book that really resonated with me and sums up how some mild dysfunction can grow to the point where the line is crossed and the relationship dynamics turn into full blown abuse.<br /><br />In addition, there were two quotes in the book that I found very inspiring, and these were:<br /><br />- ""The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for."" (Maureen Dowd)<br /><br />- ""No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear."" (Edmund Burke)<br /><br />""In Bed with the Badge"" indirectly proves how victims of abuse are re-victimzed repeatedly. For instance, the brother of the deceased and his wife who were initially supportive of the family turned against them at the wife's trial.  The fact that our justice system found the battered wife guilty of illegal gun possession is another example of punishing the victim.  I often wonder how that is even possible as she used his gun in self-defense.  Although she was found not guilty for murder in the 2nd degree and the first gun possession charge, she was found guilty on the possession of a second weapon.  This verdict not only victimizes the victim but also the children and the innocent wife's family and friends who have to mortgage their houses to support her legal defense.  I always felt the abuser has more rights than the abused and this is just another example that proves that.<br /><br />So why do I believe this story and have not one iota of doubt that every word in this book is true. Well besides the book outlining the typical patterns of abuse, I can also see from the daughter's picture on the inside jacket cover that Jennifer is indeed a very distraught child who has cried in anguish for years; it is visible in her face and faces don't lie. This utter sadness is not visible with the son Raymond's picture, however.<br /><br />I do hope Barbara is found not guilty and I hope she and her children can heal somehow even though their emotional scars will remain for life.",Positive
"This book is a compilation of advice columns featured in the ""Dear Sugar column on TheRhumpus.net"" and to me all are about relationships in one way or another. By relationships, I mean relationships with self, with friends, with parents, with children, with lovers, etc.<br /><br />I was familiar with the author's work in [[ASIN:0307592731 Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (Oprah's Book Club 2.0)]] in which she bears her soul in the rawest of forms.  Well this book is no different except that she offers advice by extrapolating instances in her own life and relating them to the question being asked.  In essence, the reader learns about her as well as her subjects.<br /><br />One story at the beginning really hit home with me.  It was about a female who had a miscarriage and was missing her child and was unable to get over her grief. What hit home is that Cheryl's response was so poignant and true.  In one sentence she says ""Others are scared of the intensity of your loss and so they use their words to push your grief away.""  This hit home for me because I was reminded of when my best friend hung himself. I was inconsolable and about two days after the suicide I mentioned this to someone who I felt was a friend of sorts and would understand. Well this older guy says to me ""Gee that must have been a high ceiling"" and then chuckled.  I got the impression he felt this was inappropriate after he said it but he couldn't take it back nor did he ever apologize.  Of all the comments I got during this time, this one was the most hurtful.  However, I now sense he really didn't know how to respond and it's true that ""Others are scared of the intensity of your loss and so they use their words to push your grief away.""<br /><br />I think anyone reading this book will find some story they relate to. I loved the story of Beauty and the Beast a fellow who felt he wouldn't find love because he is so disfigured. I think she answers most of the inquires very well or points out that the inquirer really knows the answer because they answered it themselves in their letter.<br /><br />She uses the F word a lot, which is very shocking in these contexts. In fact the story I really didn't understand very well was ""We Call this a ClusterF..."" -- you get the idea.  I also think her use of ""sweet pea"" and other similar words are patronizing although I think she meant them to be supportive.<br /><br />Overall, I believe her advice is spot on and sensible; just read past the F words. Reading this book might get you to relate some events back to your own life.  I know it did mine in the story I referenced above.",Positive
"After reading the book [[ASIN:0963810952 Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal: War Stories From the Local Food Front]] by Joel Salatin, I knew I wanted him for President. Well after reading this book, I know I'd want Senator Tom Coburn M.D. as his Vice President.<br /><br />This Senator highlights why this country is already BANKRUPT yet our politicians are denying it. Our debt crisis is mostly a spending and entitlement crisis; especially on programs such as Medicare and Social Security.  He believes in limiting government and reducing debt. We must enable people to succeed yet still care for those who cannot care for themselves.<br /><br />Senator Coburn writes about an Ohio farmer named Roscoe Filburn who grew more wheat that he was allowed to by government standards (they wanted to limit wheat to drive up prices) even though the extra wheat was for his himself. The US Supreme Court said that because his excess wheat went to feed his chickens, he was reducing the amount he would spend on the government-regulated market and because it crossed state lines, his wheat affected interstate commerce and therefore could be regulated.  Senator Coburn says this set the stage for Obamacare and its individual mandate that says free people must buy health insurance.<br /><br />He highlights numerous examples of government waste such as:<br /><br />- Earmarks, specifically allocated tax dollars, for a teapot museum.<br /><br />- The Senate charade called the ""hotline"" whereby 80% of mundane bills are passed but about 20% of costly and significant legislation is also passed by default when combined with these bills. The way it works is that usually at the end of a legislative session (such as before a vacation), all 100 Senators will receive a phone call saying that the following bills ..... will be passed if no Senator calls in to object.  Obviously, almost no one objects because not only do they not have enough time to read all that is being passed but most have no idea what is being passed and they are usually not there to receive the call. ""The hotline represents Big Government on autopilot.""<br /><br />- ""The stimulus ... spent $1.8 million for a road project in Ohio that threatened a pastor's home, $760,000 to help Georgia Tech study improvised music, $5 million to provide geothermal heat to a mall in Tennessee that was virtually empty, and $1 million in ""terrorism prevention"" money for a dinner cruise company.""<br /><br />- There's duplication in federal programs, such as 20 separate agencies that run 56 different financial literacy programs ... ""one agency manages cheese pizza (FDA) but if you buy a pepperoni pizza, that's another agency (USDA),"" etc.<br /><br />- ""The International Center for the History of Electronic Games (ICHEG) received over $100,000 in federal funds for video game preservation.""<br /><br />- ""The University of Kentucky will spend $175,000 in federal funds studying the connection between cocaine and the sex habits of quail.""<br /><br />- ""We pay farmers billions to NOT grow crops.""<br /><br />- ""We send California winemakers on wine tasting trips to Europe and Asia.""<br /><br />- ""We also study trendy baby names and sponsor fashion shows"" courtesy of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).<br /><br />- The Philadelphia Housing Authority spent $17,000 for a party with belly dancers.<br /><br />- We also send unemployment checks to millionaires.<br /><br />- ""Maine spent $60,000 of federal unemployment insurance funds on a 36-foot mural containing images of labor union strikes.""<br /><br />- The federal government has several Hollywood liaison offices which help Hollywood communicate a positive message about the federal government.  ""These agencies have at least 14 employees with a combined salary total of $1.2 million.""<br /><br />- The government has given more than $1 billion to deceased people. ""Washington paid for dead people's prescriptions and wheelchairs, subsidized their farms, helped pay their rent, and even chipped in for their heating and air-conditioning bills.""<br /><br />- The government gives millions of dollars to those who are not disabled.  For example, Stanley Thornton is an adult male who choses to wear an adult diaper and live as an adult baby. He has excellent woodworking skills and is able to build adult baby furniture yet continues to receive disability checks.<br /><br />- Etc., etc. etc........ (read the book for more ludicrousy)<br /><br />Senator Coburn then goes on to explain the five flaws of Obamacare, one being it will increase costs and decrease access to medical care.<br /><br />He ends the book with several chapters on how to bring America back to financial health, such as ending the ridiculous spending above and getting rid of mortgage interest deductions and the military commissaries which taxpayers susidize.  He also recommends eliminating the Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) for military children which costs $51,000 per student!  He recommends overhauling Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />Another interesting tidbit is that most defense contracts, which are awarded to the lowest bidder, really are ""cost plus contracts"" designed to waste our money.  The supplier of the contract can afford to come in low because they make up the money in cost overruns which the government pays.  This is a wonderful government we have; but I'm not surprised.  Politicians are more concerned about getting re-elected than doing right by the people, which is why Senator Coburn postulates that some of these charades exists in the first place.<br /><br />I believe anyone who is wondering why our enconomy is bankrupt should read this book. If Senator Coburn ever runs for Vice-President, he certainly has my vote.  Of course, I hope Joel Salatin runs for President with him.  Those two, I believe will work wonders in government and for America and also keep each other in check.",Positive
"This is definitely a history book about the unusual subject of ""cheese.""  The author examines various texts, mythology, bible quotes, and archaeological evidence and uses these references as supporting evidence that cheese existed shortly after 7000 BC. For example in archaeology, examination of vessels provided evidence of cheese making and cheese residue. There were cheese offerings related to religious beliefs and culture.<br /><br />With regard to his quoting bible verses, whether I believe the bible is fiction or not does not matter. The author's intent is that if someone could write about cheese in the bible, then it must have existed and based on his conclusions I would agree.<br /><br />During the Bronze age (3200 to 1200 BC) the use of rennett in cheese making was well established.  He talks about the Hittite Civilization (around 1400 BC) and based on historical records that include the terms scoured or finished cheese and aged soldier cheese, he speculates these were hard-rind cheeses which meant rennet coagulation was used in their production.<br /><br />Rennett coagulation could be either plant-based (as in the use of fig sap) or animal-based (the enzyme from the stomach of various animals). I would have liked to know how man discovered that he could use animal rennet as I don't feel this book was able to solve that question.<br /><br />Due to the references to very old history (Mesopotamia, Bronze Age, Neolithic Revolution, the Fertile Crescent, Chalcolithic or Copper-Stone Age, etc.), I found this book a bit difficult to digest.  What I mean by this is that the history was easy to read about because the author wrote it so well but there were so many facts to eras I know nothing about that each fact upon fact went in one side of my brain and out the other.  I can't remember much of anything although it was quite clear that cheese making has been going on for centuries and is very tied to culture based on the evidence that he provides.<br /><br />The last few chapters of the book were really interesting and much easier to grasp. For instance around the 18th century timeframe he writes:<br />  ""Seeds from the plant named turnsole (Chrozophora tinctoria) were ground up and pressed to extract the juice.  Linen cloths were then soaked in the juice, dried, and hung over a basin filled with urine, from which ammonia vapors were absorbed into the linen.  The alkaline ammonia converted the turnsole dye to a violet color. Edam cheeses were rubbed with the turnsole rags impregnated with the voilet dye, which imparted a dark violet color to the surface that changed to glowing red when the surface dried.  The turnsole treatment was not only visually stunning but also acted as an insect repellent, protecting the rind from maggots and other pests that were so troublesome for aged cheeses.""<br /><br />Throughout the book he also mentions how cheese quality was lowered because most of the cream was being used to make butter.  He ends the book with a discussion about the Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC) and the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) which are rules governing the naming of cheeses and other regulations concerning cheese. It's apparent to me that different governments are playing a tug of war with our food system that extends way beyond the raw milk controversy associated with cheese.  This tug of war (which I find disturbing) results in the differing regulations they implement or change.<br /><br />Overall, ""Cheese and Culture"" is an interesting read filled with lots of facts about cheese and cheese making as it relates to our history and culture.",Positive
"This book is a laundry list of reward examples and in that sense it lives up to its title.  However, after 127 pages I can't stand to read more because it is repetitive. Companies reward their employees day-to-day, informally, tangibly, etc. and reading a short list of how they do that with most of the rewards being pretty much the same (except that each company might have a different name or twist on the reward) bored me.  For example, Company A might give a trip or Company B might give gift certificates.  Company X might post a name of a top employee on the bulletin board or Company Y might write a paper note to that employee instead yet Company Z might write an email instead and send it off to the employee (you get the idea).<br /><br />However, there were three quotes I loved in this book (the first one I consider the best quote) which are:<br /><br />""You get the best effort from others not by lighting a fire beneath them, but by building a fire within them."" (page 48)<br /><br />""Compensation is what you give people for doing the job they were hired to do. Recognition, on the other hand, celebrates an effort beyond the call of duty."" (page 104)<br /><br />""Compensation is a right; recognition is a gift."" (page 116)<br /><br />If a person wants ideas on a different twist to each reward, then this book has met its objective. However, to me that did not make very good reading because the methods each company used  in each category were pretty much typical and the same.<br /><br />I'm glad I checked this out from my library.",Negative
"This is a very interesting book about the author's experience with birds, many of which she rehabilitated or raised from fledglings. The author is also a good sketcher and sketches many of the birds she handled peppering the book with many of these delightful images. Sometimes she temporarily ""borrows"" wild birds from their nest to sketch. This is not something I agree with but this practice seems to have litte affect on the birds according to the way she justifies it.<br /><br />It is obvious that Julie has a dislike of free-roaming cats who injure birds and several of the birds she rehabilitated or attempted to rehabilitate were mauled by cats.<br /><br />She talks about phoebes, starlings, chimney swifts, a titmouse, grouse, etc., etc.  She also included a very interesting story about a turkey vulture which throws up in her car.  Apparently turkey vulture vomit is awfully fetid--not that other vomit isn't but this is worse.  I like how she ends her book with Charlie, her parrot.  I did not realize parrots were such bad pets.  She defines a pet as an animal whose emotional needs can be met by a human being and a parrot does not fit this definition according to Julie.<br /><br />Her sketches throughtout the book are wonderful and her bird stories kept my interest.  She named many of the birds and when rehabilitated always released them if they could live on their own.  Julie is definitely a ""bird mother"" and from my perspective her husband Bill is a saint to put up with it all.  Although I'm not a birder, it was great to read about Julie's experiences and I'm am thankful their exists all forms of people in this world who take care of orphaned animals avian or otherwise.",Positive
"""Going Home: Finding Peace When Pets Die"" is a very quick read.  It is also heart-felt and gets to the core of why it is okay and perfectly natural and healthy to love our pets and grieve for them.  The author proposes several questions to be answered in the affirmative that will help one realize when to put their pet down. There is a time when we have to let go and Jon Katz makes it clear that ""hanging on is not love.""  He talks about the importance of saying goodbye even if it is a year after the loss of a pet.  He also stresses that you have to do what you feel is right.  He gives great advice and fantastic examples of how to confront children who are going to lose a pet or have lost one.  In fact, I really loved the chapter on ""Helping Children"" and felt it was one of several outstanding chapters in the book.  The other outstanding chapters were ""Getting Another Pet"" and ""Perfect Day.""<br /><br />In ""Perfect Day"" Jon Katz gives a very brief and touching story on how Harry prepared for grieving his dog.  Harry decided to give Duke a ""Perfect Day"" once he found out the dog's heart was failing him.  Harry took off the day from work and during that day he fed Duke human food he knew he would love (although he never was allowed human food before), he took him out to play with the toys he loved, he went to a state park to sit by a stone abatement with a beautiful view and took some cherished pictures of Duke, etc.  The entire day was Duke's.  Several weeks later the dog died, but what a wonderful way to have celebrated the dog's life a few weeks before and cement such a cherished memory of his pet.<br /><br />Although Jon Katz says he wrote the book to help others, after reading it I also believe writing this book was a healing process for him to work through the grief and guilt he experienced by having to put down his dog Orson in 2005 after he bit three people.<br /><br />Overall, I really loved this book.  Even if you haven't lost a pet yet, those who read this book might change their attitude about the way they respond to those that have lost one such as by becoming an active listener instead of saying things like ""it's only a dog"" or ""get over it.""<br /><br />I wanted to give ""Going Home: Finding Peace When Pets Die"" five stars but could not for two reasons.  First, I felt the author could have delved a little deeper into pet loss by providing some more wonderful stories and examples of good ways to grieve such a loss.  I just wanted more breadth of discussion in the book.  Second, although I commend Jon Katz for not sugarcoating anything and love this about the book I do feel that sometimes he makes strong statements that others might find contradictory.  To me there were three contradictory statements in the book but the one that struck me the most (and caused me to lower this review) was when he mentioned how a friend spent $20,000 to ""prove"" her love for her dog and then he said ""I believe that it's not ethical or appropriate in this world to spend that kind of money on a dog while so many human beings suffer so much."" In the next sentence he softens the message by saying that he doesn't believe his friend was wrong for spending so much money on an animal but that that is not always what is best for the animal.  I agree with his last message but not with text I quoted.  Although I am glad for his honesty, despite whether I agree or not, I wonder what kind of guilt this statement would cause someone who has just mortgaged their house to save their beloved pet thinking that this was the right thing to do only to have that pet die.  When that person buys this book hoping for some solace, perhaps it is guilt they will now feel as a result of the author's statement in this context.<br /><br />NOTE:  It is possible this strong quote will be changed in the published copy of this book; but in my pre-release copy it exists.<br /><br />The two other areas of the book that were slightly contradictory to me are:<br /><br />- His mention of an animal communicator and providing supporting evidence that the communicator knew things only he knew such as when he sometimes felt his dead dog's weight on his foot (in spirit, I guess). Yet at the end of the book he says such things as ""hearing our pet's tags jingling, feeling her leaning against our leg"" account for how much harder it is to emotionally accept the loss of a pet.  So on one hand he supports the animal communicator visit as someone who actually can communicate with a dead animal but on the other hand at the end of the book he seems to be saying that our experiences are related to our not being able to accept the loss emotionally.<br /><br />- His excellent suggestion that there are millions of cats and dogs in shelters who would be pleased to come and love people who have lost their beloved pets; yet on the next page he provides an example of introducing his friend to a breeder to find a new pet. Although a breeder is a possibility, in this case an example of someone picking out a shelter pet might have been more appropriate especially since the author seems to own or have owned only breed specific dogs.",Positive
"It has taken me over three weeks to read this very large guide. The text covers many topics in an easy-to-read format that every employee should be aware of with regard to their rights in the workplace.  The topics range from OSHA rules, tobacco smoke in the workplace, 401K and pension plans, privacy rights, pregnancy discrimination, medical insurance and COBRA, whistleblower laws, etc., etc.<br /><br />There are some interesting case studies that the author uses to make a point.  For instance in one case study a company denied workers the use of toilet facilities.  Although the employer was following the letter of the law (providing enough facilities but not letting them use it) OSHA's official ruling on the matter stated ""Toilets that employees are not allowed to use for extended periods cannot be said to be 'available' to those employees.""<br /><br />The author also provides a list of laws by topic for each state (where applicable) which you can research further.<br /><br />One thing I felt lacking in the book is an explanation of whether employees have different rights depending on living in one state and working in another.  I assume the law associated with the state they work in applies, but I am wondering if there are exceptions to this.<br /><br />Overall, this guide is good for someone who is unfamiliar with their employee rights.  Many of the items covered will be familiar to those who have been in the workforce a while and, except for some nuances of the law, this book will offer just a little bit more knowledge. What I've learned more than anything else is that in many cases you'll need to get a lawyer to protect your rights.",Positive
"This is a good book to get if you want to relieve your heirs of the cost and time burden associated with your state's involvement in your estate after your death.<br /><br />The author mentions that this text really includes nine ways to avoid probate; not eight was as specified in the title. Although she discusses numerous ways you can plan your estate to avoid probate she does not specify which of the many ways are included in her count of nine. Here is a list of ten and I felt there were more ways than that or perhaps they were just nuances on this list.<br /><br />- Payable on Death Designation (assign a beneficiary designation on accounts, CDs, life insurance, etc.)<br />- Transfer-on-Death Registration (stocks, bonds, vehicles)<br />- Non-Probate Transfer Procedures (available in certain states for vehicles)<br />- Joint Ownership with Right of Survivorship<br />- Special Transfer Procedures for Vehicles (some states have special non-probate procedures for this) - perhaps not one of the 9 ways<br />- Transfer-on-Death Deed (real estate)<br />- Joint Tenancy<br />- Tenancy by Entirety<br />- Community Property (in some states this designation will avoid probate)<br />- Living Trusts<br />etc......<br /><br />In summary, the author does an adequate job of explaining many different options and includes hypothetical examples of couples who use different techniques to avoid probate. She also gives a brief summary of the state rules for all the states which you should always verify.  It is adviseable to research the rules further in the citations provided if your estate is complex.  In addition, a glossary of legal terms is provided at the end.<br /><br />This is a good book but I would have liked a closing summary that listed the nine ways to avoid probate with a reference to what types of property they applied to (sort of like my example above).",Positive
"""Scent of the Missing"" is supposed to be about the author and her dog's adventures, relationship, and Search and Rescue (SAR) work.  However, there is nothing adventurous about the story and not much interesting about the relationship.<br /><br />Until Chapter 12, the story is a hodgepodge of different facts about the author's life that have very little to do about the adventures of Puzzle the dog.  Suzanne talks about the Golden Retriever and its history, emails she sent to find the right dog, the fact that she's divorced, then she mentions suicide (that takes up about 3 sentences), etc., etc.  I felt I was getting ""whiplash"" as the author bounced from one unrelated fact to the next usually within the next sentence.  Without a transition to let the reader know she was going to talk about something else entirely, the reader is left frustrated, bored, and confused when reading this book.<br /><br />Three examples of what I mean by the above are:<br /><br />- When the author told the story about Puzzle coming home for the first time, in one paragraph you are on the plane and in the next paragraph she starts talking about Puzzle sniffing the Poms' butt (Pom meaning her Pomeranians) at home.<br /><br />- In one story she tells about SAR work she did when looking for a man who allegedly was drowned in the water under his boat. The chapter ends with the message that she will be told by the divers about whether they find this man or not in the water.  However, you never find out because the next chapter starts another boring nonsensical story about housebreaking a Golden retriever.<br /><br />- In another story, Suzanne rehashes a car conversation she has with another SAR worker, then mentions the storm of 1964 in another sentence, then talks a little about the boring SAR work that night.<br /><br />The four barely okay parts to this book are:<br /><br />- The one good paragraph about when she picked up Scuppy, an old blind dog who was going to be euthanized at the shelter.<br /><br />- The cute way Puzzle came home on the airplane.<br /><br />- The search for Mrs. Celeste in Chapter 12, an old lady suffering from Alzheimer's.<br /><br />- The information about what it's like to do SAR work in Chapter 13.<br /><br />In summary, I highly commend the author for the SAR work she, her dog, and her teammates do; however, this book lacks any gripping story about that work and the writing is dreadful and totally unemotional.  I am actually shocked that other authors have endorsed this book on the back cover and can't believe a publisher would publish this book unless the author paid for it.<br /><br />If you are still interested in ""Scent of the Missing,"" borrow it from the library because if you purchase it you probably will wish you hadn't.  I've already thrown it out.",Negative
"""My journey with Farrah"" is a book about how Farrah's best friend Alana helped Farrah during her battle with cancer--from the time she was diagnosed until her death.  It is written in diary form as if you were reading Alana's diary.  From Alana's point of view, you get an inside peek at Farrah's cancer battle.  The book demonstrates to me the love Alana and Farrah had for each other.  The story will humble you as you gain insight into how an extraordinarily beautiful and down-to-earth woman could be ravaged by such a disease.<br /><br />I've read most of the negative reviews about this book, but did not have the same reaction as the other readers had.  Although at times Alana can come across as selfish, I don't think this book would have been ""true"" had she not revealed her innermost thoughts that make Alana a human being like anyone else.  I commend Alana for voicing those thoughts even though most might recoil at them.  Since Ryan (Farrah's significant other for 30+ years) supported Alana in the writing of this book, I believe Farrah would approve.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book about Farrah's life, this is not it.  However, if you want to know all about Farrah's battle with cancer these last few years through Alana's eyes, then this book will give you a glimpse of Farrah's struggle along with what Alana's life was like during that time.",Positive
"This is a fictional story that is as engaging and real as any true story.  ""Alive Day: A Story of Love and Loyalty "" is about a blind psychiatrist and his guide dog who help a paralyzed Marine see that he still has a wonderful and fulfilling life to live.  The story definitely has the propensity to be true and certainly encourages the reader to contemplate their disabilities in life and how they can adjust to them.  It also ends on a beautiful note.",Positive
"This cookbook is easy to read and most of the ingredients (except for the eel) are pretty easy to get if you live in an urban area.  Despite the healthy looking dish on the cover, a lot of recipes involve frying in oil.  For those who are extremely health conscious or want to limit their salt intake, you will find fewer recipes.<br /><br />I found several recipes in the rice and noodle section that are more health conscious; but many of the dishes I wouldn't make because of the deep frying involved (those requiring a 1/4 cup or more of oil).  I did make the sweet potato noodle dish which was delicious.  Since the dish included 1/4 cup of sugar, some would not call it totally healthy.  It took me two hours to make but a more accomplished cook could do it in one hour.<br /><br />I feel this cookbook is a nice addition to a cook's library and certainly everyone should be able to find at least three recipes in this cookbook that will be suitable to their diet, tasty, and worth the cost of the book.",Positive
"Rick Merrifield asks you to rethink the ""whats"" of doing business instead of the ""hows"" in an effort to reduce costs or increase innovation.  It is clear that many times we focus on how we are doing something (the mechanical piece) instead of what (the actual task) we are doing.  He encourages businesses to identify what is truly valuable, determine desired outcomes, and then think about how you can improve performance.<br /><br />You do this by determining the ""whats"" that are operating at peak levels which generate value and those that do not and then determine what to do about it.  In general high value ""whats"" contribute to overall performance and identify your company for the better in some significant way. However, he stresses that you cannot always ignore the low value ""whats"" such as government rules and regulations which can turn into something of high value if your company is non-compliant.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author provides several examples to illustrate his point.  For instance, Burgerville paid attention to their ""Manage Human Resources What"" that actually cost them more money by giving cheaper health coverage to part time employees. Although this didn't reduce their costs, it achieved substantial employee satisfaction and reduced turnover.  Case studies for ING DIRECT, Eclipse and others are also presented.<br /><br />I think the data could have been better organized by presenting the subject matter being discussed followed by the case studies labeled by company. I would have also preceded each company section with a brief description of the positive (or negative) message being conveyed for that company.<br /><br />To me the book is a bit confusing.  It is a quick read but is a bit tedious to understand with all the ""whats"" and ""hows"" peppered through the text.  I also feel you don't need 212 pages to explain that instead of only evaluating the mechanics of ""how"" you are performing a task, remember to also look at ""what"" the actual task is and how it can be improved.<br /><br />The best example the author gives is in the introductory chapter where he mentions that a lady wanted to reduce costs associated with taking her dog to the park for a walk.  Originally she concentrated on the ""how"" (finding a different route to reduce gas costs); but when she still wasn't happy with the results she looked at the ""what"" (walk dog in park) and decided to go to an acceptable park (though not as good as the other one) closer to home which reduced her costs more.  I don't think you need a book to understand this.",Negative
"What a cookbook!!!!!  I have never read a recipe book in such detail. The stories the author tells are extremely amusing, very lively and enjoyable.  The finished recipes titillate the palate with such wonderful flavors.<br /><br />Although stated otherwise on the book jacket, I feel the recipes take quite a bit of preparation.  They may be simple in the sense that they have few ingredients, but the preparation takes time.  Also, some of the ingredients are so rare or hard to find that it was almost impossible to make them without some form of substitution and I live in a pretty urban area.  My local supermarket that has both extensive international and organic aisles did not have some of the ingredients.  In some cases, substitutes are suggested but in others they are not.  For instance, I could not find farro anywhere locally; although Amazon does sell it.<br /><br />This cookbook is definitely five stars but I had to lower my rating to four stars because an attempt is not made to explain some of the ingredients and finding them is so difficult.  For the seasoned cook who lives in or near New York City or Los Angeles or the person who does not mind ordering ingredients online, then this will be an invaluable recipe book.  Delizioso (delicious) ...",Positive
"From the title I would have thought this book was only about Dr. DeVincentis patients but he also talks about his own animals.  I loved the array of stories and his compassion.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because the arrangement of the last story was sort of out of place. For instance, he talks about his new dog Billie after his previous dog Cotton dies. You are treated to life with Billie through the previous chapters and then in the last chapter he brings you back to how he acquired Billie.<br /><br />Other than this, the book is an enjoyable and heartwarming read.",Positive
"I ordered this book over one year ago because of the rave reviews.  I tried two recipes in it.  The lemon pound cake was dense, too lemony and just all around not to my or my boyfriend's liking.  The vanilla cupcakes were so, so.  I make exceptional desserts from recipes in other books and articles and people have raved about them. I also follow instructions precisely.  However, in this case I know that the recipes are not good (at least to me) and the baker is not the problem.  I guess I just don't have a taste for the recipes in this book. I am almost afraid to try another recipe because the two others have been so disappointing.<br /><br />Perhaps this book is for someone who has different tastes from the norm.  However, I like decadent desserts.  So far I'm thoroughly disappointed and wished I hadn't purchased the book.",Negative
"Didion's book is about one person's disjointed feelings regarding the death of her husband and sickness of her child within days of each other.  It offers a good look into the confused state of the grieving person.  In fact it was so good at conveying this haphazard state of mind that I was at times confused reading the book. I rated this book 4 stars instead of 5 because of this.<br /><br />I appreciate how hard it must have been for the author to write this book, although it probably also served some therapeutic value to her as well.<br /><br />Another good book on death is ""Chasing Daylight.""  It is more a book about life than death.  This book deals with the author's approach to putting closure on his life three months before his death",Positive

"Kudos to the paper! Pages almost feel like paper fabric! As if made from a fibrous pulp and turning pages I kept trying to separate into a single sheet before realizing it’s just the papers thickness! This with a few “jumps” in story made me believe- I may have double flipped/skipped a page!! But, NoPe! Written on beautiful paper book has inviting cover and boasts longevity..<br /><br />Matted in color.. illustrations are unique + quirky fun! Little Miss Olga is one of a kind and I love her for that- along with accompanied visuals!! We all look, act, think and feel different.. some days more than others! In creating an “off the wall” character she seeps in and captures reader bc we can resonate with her emotions and may even feel our external self looks a bit odd/goofy in these moments.<br /><br />Im not bothered by “why” she is sad.. I actually appreciate we might not always know where a feeling comes from! All can feel a bit lonely, silly, needy, blue without knowing the root of why. A great + healthy concept to help be understood. Only, how story reads.. this needs explanation depending on age- Fact nothing is wrong or broken if we feel this way- I wish was addressed in story. Knowing this is more beneficial then just knowing why!<br /><br />Story continues with Olga steadfast in accepting her sadness like fate with a “nothing can make it better” attitude- Only as she begins vividly expressing feelings to ensure reader knows just how “sad!” Her forms of expression actually lift her spirits up and into her uncontrolled giggles! Something she unknowingly accomplished all by herself! Her and her colorful imagination. Another empowering moment to address: if sad  you WILL be happy again and powers to do this may even be found inside you! This is where story ends- I only wish it circled back with a closing page to reiterate Olga’s accomplishments and how. I feel this is a child’s book with adult inferred conclusion.<br /><br />The missed potential- is not including a written reveal or message more clearly for its targeted audience.. As adults, we can surmise and see the intentions. Younger readers will most likely need open dialogue to discuss and digest. Hmm..? Maybe this was authors purpose all along.. to create a dialogue with reader/listener on a topic such as feelings and mental health? Only if book is read by child alone.. message becomes a lost opportunity. Flaws and all- it’s a quality find and could be a fun gift or bookshelf addition. Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",Positive
"Very unique and interesting read… A topic that should take precedence in every household for the greater good of the planet and communities of people residing all over it. I love the fact this provides small parts to create the bigger picture of sustainable travel. So, even if you cannot put into practice all 100% of shared information… With these ideas broken down- it will still allow one to make the efforts anyplace they can.. it’s not an “all or nothing” type deal..<br /><br />Book takes a different approach than expected- thinking this would be a “how too- check list” or, step/step numbered instruction guide to follow for travel in various regions.. I was wrong!<br /><br />Instead, this is delivered to educate and teach a traveler to consider sort of a holistic thought process while asking self impacting questions  prior to any travel plans. This help you learn about various things to be cognitive of, prior to any travel plans being made. ie.. Did you realize or stop to think- some communities are actually harmed by commercialized travel. It disrupts culture and The indigenous communities way of life in a negative way.. here I thought in my naïveté, travel only brought a positive source of income to any destination.. the “they’d only be so lucky to make a profit mentality” i’m being honest when I share this and humbled, definitely not proud of my ignorance. This book helps you take pause prior to making plan to visit specific regions of the world and ask yourself.. is there a better way to visit said location- and truly think about your impact when doing so! It isn’t “travel shaming” but, travel enlightenment!!<br /><br />The book does offer its: when, where, why, what and with who questions when planning to travel.. it isn’t a read telling you never to venture out- it’s just rather showing how to do so responsibly. The book also offers travel by region- it even offers tips of things such as: if I’m from the US traveling to The south of France and would love to see the British Virgin isles- maybe it’s best to return home via a stop through islands to save 2 separate trips.. it can show you various ways to combo the most in a travel experience… Of course cutting down on the carbon output.<br />Overall- this is a great topic that would make an incredible college course! This could be a great gift for the one full of wonder lost in your life. You find out how aloof we can be and how changing ones way of thinking, can create a positive impact immediately!! I included photos of various topics from book that peaked my interest- as well as the table of content. Hoping this info can help in your decision.. Safe travels!",Positive

(I figure, you either trust the source or not.. and if so- youre looking for answers.. not research data! I find this author is obviously skilled in his OB craft and knowledgable!)<br />•This book is best used at beginning of pregnancy- as it’s created to help from the start.. and thus, eliminates calls to Dr. in a panic over something you didn’t know but, already did! As with any new subject, common sense tells us- information is best from the start- and same is true with this information. (Nobody tries building their ikea goods and getting the needed info. at the end- not if their not wanting to makes errors anyway!)<br /><br />• This book is geared towards “I AM pregnant and I have questions?“ I appreciate that. This does not use chapters explaining how to get pregnant, as it pretty much assumes you’re already there! For any needing pre-pregnancy books those are readily available.. I like the separation of the two!!<br />•This is formatted like a pregnancy Bible. Being you can read the book cover to cover if you wish- or, you can look a specific question/topic up in a beginning section.. and just flip to an answer on specific page- nice!<br />•This is written in a very understanding way- those without medical background will not struggle with info. It also provides ideas of what you’ll need and a timeline, questions to ask appt., prep for safety, how to find a pediatrician etc. it does all the above very straightforward- it doesn’t give endless info., getting the reader lost/overwhelmed. *timeline is such a nice feature to help you prep as well! I love this for 1st time parents.. it encourages things you can do along the way which I feel, helps pass the time (never does time moved so slow, except maybe in covid lockdown?!) and it helps get couple excited and ready- a win/win... win!!<br /><br />•So, why do I say great for first-time parents? Truly, the info given will become common knowledge after a first pregnancy. But, as I mentioned- I am from a family where my daddio had largest single OB practice in the US- Yep, in Provo utah..!! He delivered approx. 150 babies a month..(1 of every 7 people in the state!!) for me, I thought everyone knew this info. as it was common table talk. You can imagine the surprise when my own sweet husband (an only child) asked what an episiotomy or a Braxton Hicks was!! The horror right..??!! And that’s when it all clicked.. most people don’t have a C-sections topic at their dinner table! Making this a great way to be all inclusive for any first timers or, any (which is most..) not baptized into the medical world of pregnancy!<br />•I ordered for my niece/husband to read as they’re having there 1st bambino.. yay! They both have been in contact letting me know- from both points of view, how helpful the info has been.. and to me, there’s no better endorsement than that!<br />•I struggled between 4/5 star rating- I’d like to give it 4.5 and the reason being, the info is standard and geared toward 1st time knowledge (of course, any can always gain more info., as each pregnancy can be different!) but, I feel this reads more as a “first time” parent handbook.. and felt that in a title would be a better fit.<br />Long winded, and I apologize- But, with so many options I felt this was one book I could provide knowledgable feedback and hopefully help make the right choice for your needs!<br />  Hope this helps.. feel free to let me know!",Positive
"This is a book focused on helping the reader be/become cognizant of ones relationship and the need to take time to create “time” for one another (ha! the one thing most of us- especially parents.. don’t have extra of on any given day of the week!!)<br />Let’s face it- the reality of the demands from kids, careers, home, finances, health, social interactions, etc. all play a part of taking a toll on a relationship. Which is ironic bc, majority of that list grew from your relationship.. it’s full circle, I know!!<br /><br />I appreciated this read. But, I feel this could be done at the pace of the reader- If one chooses to stay a minute in the practice of meditation, I say do it!! Some of these ideas may be new to the reader and better understood to sit with that moment.. a pause in the read till you feel ”comfortable” or connected enough to the concept to move on. **I feel it would be best for the author to verbalize this a bit more- sort of “permission” to take this in and get comfortable.. Sure! full benefits aren't reached till this book is completed.. But, this isn’t alway our reality- and probably why a reason one’s reaching out for this book in the first place! Lack of time plays a major part in relationships and also, in the roll of strengthening them. (TBH, last thing I wanted- was to begin this and feel “one more pressure” to add to my list of the things I had to complete. I didn’t choose to approach this read with that pressure and that was nice.)<br /><br />This is an opportunity for either one half or, the whole of a couple to learn to reconnect by an ability to Stop. Breathe. Think. Reflect. Understand.  Then, with some helpful thoughts and insight they've included exercises one can participate in and put to paper some of the Thoughts. Feelings. Ideas. Issues. Future.. The nice part is- these can be completed by one person or, both Parties- and be helpful either way.<br /><br />I appreciated this wasn’t religious or, spiritual read- trying to sell the authors belief , making it more universal to anyone.. (I would describe vibe as gaining more of a sense of self before being able to<br />Move on to anything else) I felt this was quite insightful at a very decent level. It doesn’t get too deep where the type of help being offered should really be handled with a professional.. and it’s not sugar coated candy- it will let you get your hands dirty and get deeper!) It has a lot of helpful, and grounding “refreshers” that I feel remind us of “why they’re in the relationship in the first place...” This is best for showing one/couple to:<br /> •take pause…<br />•how to clear the mind using simple meditation<br /> (necessary evil (ha!) to clear a all distractions-<br />  and not some crazy voodoo kind of way either!!)<br />•help couples to revisit why they got together<br /> (and the importance of fueling that connection)<br /><br />It is nice in the fact, it doesn't scold or reprimanded the reader- It shows how in life, life can happen to you! we can drift apart in our partnership.. and the need/benefits of getting back to where we all wish to be.<br />This highlights/emphasis’ its focus on standing still then.. lends wisdom with sensible information- some being new ideas/insight (some things we may know- but, never hurt to revisit and see in print.) Different sections provide exercises that can be done as you move thru the process of coming back to the same “zip code..” I feel this book can prove quite helpful with/out partner participation. (Sometimes change in our actions gives positive reaction.) As well as, this can still prove helpful with/out both completing the exercises provided.<br /><br />Overall, I appreciated the positive knowledge and intellect. It is a hopeful read and could not hurt anyone who I trying to improve the reconnect component with their partner.",Positive
More like a pamphlet<br />Not even worth the money<br />I bought a book  for around the same price and it was a BOOK  with the information you want and needed<br />I don’t recommend it,Negative

"I love reading the thrillers gendre and I watch too many crime shows on TV, so hence I thought this plot was a little drawn out and predictable.  Dont get me wrong, there were moments where I was caught in the description, but the plot left me with 'ooh, it is a who's done it' and the outcome once revealed, the rest was tedious and the ending was weak.<br /><br />I just think in part 3 of the book - it was in crazy land and no normal person would stay unless they are equally mentally ill and it just didnt seem to fit the character than was in part 1 and 2 of the novel.  Sometimes, you can try to be too clever and it is hard to unravel and connect the dots to make sense of it all.",Negative
"okay, as an experience, this novel did nothing to tickle my brain cells and i certainly was not devouring it, as I would for mystery/thriller books.  For me the pace was tooo slow and torturous at times.  it does pick up half way throug the book, when I was just about to ditch it as I couldnt delay reading other books I have on my reading list.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple: doctor's confidentiality versus personal interest, back stabbing and self preservations.  Who do you trust?  the characters never really developed for me and hence the story fell flat even when I go to the end.",Negative
"A 217-page novel: I wanted to get into the characters and why are they connected and how they have become connected and then to be taken on a journey of this triller of 'Who done it'.  Alas, it was not too be: in fact, the author was too efficient in taking me around the scenaries of Naples, the underground society dubbed the 'Camorra' and how the church is connected to these so called 'protectors'.  I got the gist, but I wanted so much more so that I could become attached to Natalia, her two best friends one of whom works for the Camorra; and there is Pino, her police partner, but someone who wanted more - a relationship; ooh, this could have been a page turner.  Instead I was left bored and since it was a short novel, I ploughed through it just to see who did it.  I think the author has a lot of potential to develope this character so that I could become emotionally attached as well as to the beauty and danger of Naples-Italy.  Would I like to try the second book: sure, but it will need more details, more expansion to the plot.",Negative
the book gives some background on hedge funds and the various strategies in nice layman terms.  The second part goes into the various types of functions in a hedge fund from front to back office jobs.  And what the entry point would be if you were pre or post mba and those with RELEVANT experiences.  if you already have relevant experience then this book will be useless; if you have lots of experiences but none that fit the typical functions then this book is useless as it does not provide 'alternative' options for those who want to break into the industry.  great if you are still in colleage and want some good guidance of what is out there and how to break in to the industry.,Negative
My least favorite book out of 6 I've bought. Not loving the images. A couple ok ones. I wouldn't recommend it.,Negative
Not loving the recipes in this book.  It was a Christmas gift. I've only tried making 1 recipe and it wasn't very good.  A chicken dish with a weird (to me anyways)  spice blend.  Overall I  may try 2 or 3 recipes in total. Cause the book itself (nice high quality materials) I rate 2 stars but for the recipes I'd rate 1 star.  Even if he prepared these recipes for me I still wouldn't want to eat too many of them.,Negative
"Oh, sorely disappointed with this.  The images are darling, but maybe the plastic or the paper are too thin? Because all it does is get wrinkly.  Bought it as a gift, but I am really thankful I didn't give it away.  The resulting pins just make me sad, and they look really rudimentary.  Expected more and better than I got.",Negative
"Was really torn up, looking like it came out of the garbage",Negative
"Cliche after cliche, nothing new or inspiring, not touching at all...",Negative
Disappointing,Negative
"I used to really enjoy this author's books. His last few have become progressively more political. One doesn't want to read in a book about everything you hear on the news. Books are for escaping and enjoying a different experience. Extremely disappointing, to the point that I won't be buying any more of this author's books.",Negative
"I have read this series from the beginning. The last two books have been very disappointing. Ms. Stabenow seems to have developed a liking for the F word and GD. I'm not prude but the repetitious use of both of those things seemed really unnecessary. As others have mentioned, the author appears to be lacking enthusiasm. The previous book was a bit better but I'm struggling to get through this one. I don't think I'll buy any more books in the series if she writes more.",Negative
"I have read all of Ms. Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed them. But this one, I couldn't get through. Barr is an excellent writer, but this topic, and it's darkness, is not what I want to read about. I have heard Ms. Barr speak. She has a wonderful sense of humor, is an excellent speaker and had the audience in the palm of her hand. As others have said, please get back to the Anna Pigeon we know and love.",Negative
Not a favorite and my daughter hardly enjoyed it.,Negative
"Not one of the best B'Bear books, for sure!",Negative
"Sorry, I just don't like this book.  Seems like a child could have written this.",Negative
"This book is really awful. It isn’t as cute or clever as the original. And the message comes across as super passive aggressive. Pretty sure all the positive reviews are grandparents.<br />The granny donkey has nothing to do and gets grumpy when her son and granddaughter don’t visit her enough. (Apparently her granddaughter has no mother as there is no mention of her at all.) Granny donkey is only grinning and happy when her son and granddaughter make time to visit her. [Insert my eyeroll here.]<br />It doesn’t portray healthy relationships. It doesn’t portray the granny donkey in a good light. (She’s more of a bored toddler pitching a fit than an adult with her own life and ability to visit people herself.)  And it isn’t funny or clever, so there is nothing really redeeming going on. The Wonky Donkey was cute. This isn’t.",Negative
The cover and binding on this Bible is nice. It is a bonded type leather. I’m not a fan of the leadership study notes. I just don’t think that translates well in a Bible study format. I found the study notes odd.,Negative
"I'm not thrilled with this book. My kids love logic, so I thought this would be right up their alley. Many of the brain teasers have to be seen to be understood, so it isn't something you can really read aloud or use for a classroom. The alien narrating the book gives you their pronouns in their introduction. They also use really weird names that are hard to pronounce and use made up words for the aliens and their planet, which make some of the brain teasers really incoherent. My kids didn't like the puzzles all that much. Most of them were super simple, which isn't any fun. We just didn't have much fun with this book.",Negative
"This is the most cheaply made textbook I have ever seen in my life. It is incredibly flimsy. The binding has no hope of holding up over time because the cover is just too thin for the number of pages. It has decent margins to take notes in, but the paper is so thin and glossy. The pages are difficult to read in certain lighting situations and at certain angles because of the glossiness. The book has a very strong bias— comments about a certain political figure should have definitely been excluded. Inserting political bias into a books that has nothing to do with the subject is unethical. I’m not even a supporter of the political figure in question, but I am strongly against using a psychology textbook as an outlet for the author’s personal political opinions. I also feel like the information could have been more concisely presented. I also fail to see how the price of this book is justified. Books a tenth of the price have better information in a better quality format. All of the images are in black and white. There is zero color printing inside this overpriced book.",Negative
The book could have been cute. The writing was just too overthought. There were far too many central characters to keep the story moving for younger kids. I’m not sure who the audience was for this book. I used it as a read aloud to my preschooler through fifth grader and they wanted to like the story but had such a hard time following. It could have used some massive simplifying.,Negative
"This planner isn’t very good quality. Just filling it out and the cover was half falling off. This will not hold up for the year. I also happened to dislike the layout- it didn’t work well for our particular school year, which starts in September.",Negative
"I have a hard time placing my finger on why I disliked this book so much. I will try, but overall, I disliked it much more than I can even convey. So much of the book was just the author talking about herself. I felt like the first two chapters were spent with her trying to tell you why she is the expert, despite her not having much to say. When you finally get into the “meat” of the book, all the advice simply boils down to clean eating, with some Bible verses thrown in to make it a Christian approach and not the approach of most other diets on the market. There isn’t enough information in the book to consider it more than just a basic intro to clean eating, which you can probably get for free from bloggers if you just look up the term “clean eating”. There are some recipes in the book but none that are really revolutionary or even more than basic.<br />If you’re looking for this info, Trim Healthy Mama does a better job and has a more unique approach.",Negative
"I’m used to odd books. As a homeschool mom, some of the best resources are a little odd. This one does not fit that category. I’ll go with the positive first. Introducing state capitals as people is clever. It does lend itself to better memory, if you’re a person who learns people and names better than facts. That is where the positives end with this book.<br />You’ve got five friends who each tour a different region of the US visiting their friends. Each two page spread features a new state with a lot of info for each state. The information is good, but the way it is presented is just overwhelming and not easily processed. It is very poorly written.<br />The illustrations are terrible. The font choices are awful. The graphics are very dated. Pretty sure I remember doing block wave graphics on my first computer back in junior high. The entire look of this book is terrible. It is just a jumbled mess of information.",Negative
"I bought these to use with our Jesus Storybook Bible.They were not at all what I expected. They are loose pages, not in a book form and not hole-punched for storing. They are full color, which sounds cool, except that means there are no coloring type activities. There wasn't a lot to DO with these. I was pretty disappointed. They don't copy well, either, because they are full color. I wouldn't recommend these at all.",Negative
"After the first book, I swore I was done with this series. Ms. Pfeffer has the most uncanny ability to make the apocalypse seem boring. I said I'd never read another of her books. Then I got bored, and continued reading the series. Book two was better, but still boring. I swore I was done wasting my time on these books. And here I am reviewing number four.  You'd think I would learn.<br /><br />Once again, boring. New love story in this book. This book came across as an odd and very tame [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]]. Only, instead of fighting to the death they are playing soccer. Those who are in the elite play soccer against the laborers to show him they are better and keep them in their place. *yawn* It does get a tad more exciting as the book goes on, but still an overall boring read.<br /><br />This time I am really, really done with this series. Done, I tell you!",Negative
"I was expecting to like this book much more than I did. There was some practical stuff in the book, but not as much as I would have hoped. This book presents the husband as the authority in the house. In all areas. At all time. Kitchen needs to be remodeled? Husband decides how. Kids need new homeschool curriculum? Ask Dad what he want them to learn. It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend the book. Want something better and along the same lines? Try [[ASIN:1592767923 Smart Martha's Catholic Guide for Busy Moms]] or [[ASIN:B006ZEUAW8 Mrs. Meyer's Clean Home: No-Nonsense Advice That Will Inspire You to Clean Like the Dickens]].",Negative
"The premise of this anthology is genius. Some top young adult fiction writers all writing shorts stories about zombies or unicorns (a few had both). The way the book was laid out was clever. Justine and Holly introduce each story with a bit of back and forth about the story. Unfortunately, that was the best part of the book. (Other than the cover, which is awesome. If you're buying this book, buy the hardback copy!)<br /><br />The stories just fell way, way short of my expectations. Not everyone can write a good short story. Short story writing takes a different kind of talent than some of these trilogy writers possess, sorry to say. Very few of the stories were even decent. They were, for the most part, lackluster stories. Which is so sad when the topic is Zombies or Unicorns!<br /><br />Carrie Ryan's story was one of the better of the set. However, her story was simply an extension of her ""Forest of Hands and Teeth"" series. She wrote a short story into that framework.<br /><br />Scott Westfeld's story was another one of the better stories. (Though it left much to be desired.)<br /><br />Diana Peterfreund's story (The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn) was probably the best story of the whole book. Even in short story form, it told a complete story. (A story you found yourself wishing there was a whole book of to enjoy!)<br /><br />I'll admit, even if someone had told me how bad the book was, I couldn't have resisted buying it anyway. You're probably like that, too. So go ahead and lower your expectations way, way down before you buy the book. Lower them to the ground, maybe a little below ground. Now that your expectations are so low, you'll likely enjoy the book. My expectations were way too high to enjoy it.<br /><br />Parental blurb (since this is a young adult book): Gore! Lots of it in different and varying forms. Cursing! Lots of it, often not the most intelligibly used. Sex! More than I'd care to read about in a book about zombies and unicorns. No graphic descriptions or anything. Rape! *shudder* Beastiality! *double shudder* Suicide! (And in favor of it.) It is not, at all, what I'd call a 13 and up. If it was a movie, it'd be rated R.",Negative
"There was once a MAD TV skit about a lady going to a psychiatrist for help with her phobias. She was deathly afraid of being trapped in a small box. Her psychiatrist's response was, ""Stop it!"" It was a funny sketch. This book reminded me of a long version of that sketch, and not as funny. Perhaps I just didn't get it. I couldn't ever tell if the author was trying to be humorous or if it was an actual self help book where the advice was simply, ""Stop it!"" Maybe it was supposed to be both? I'm not a fan of overly used ""curse"" words. It is obnoxious to me. Perhaps that was my turn off. Or maybe I just didn't like the author's voice in the book. This book just fell very short for me, though I know there will be plenty of people who love and adore it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cover is awesome.",Negative
"Luci Swindoll gives you motherly advice on how to have a happy life. In 50 short chapters, Swindoll passes on life's secrets to you.<br /><br />Only, Luci Swindoll isn't a mother. And Luci Swindoll is telling you all the things a mother tells her children. None of this is revolutionary. Some of it is even counter productive. I'm not sure Miss Swindoll has much grounds to give anyone life advice. It seems her only qualification is that she has lived. I know this sounds harsh, and it is nothing agianst Miss Swindoll, I'm sure she's a swell woman. I'm just not sure what publisher thought this book was a good idea to publish.<br /><br />Honestly, Luci lost me at number one. It was just bad advice, honestly. Chapter one was ""honor your father and mother"". The advice given might have been great for those that have relatively normal parents and normal circumstances. But it is downright terrible advice for those of you who have abusive, narcissistic, or sociopathic parents. Of course, Miss Swindoll cannot possible know all of our circumstances, but she comes at it from the angle of ""knowing"" someone with a difficult relationship with her horrible mother and he still honored her and she took the verbal abuse to take care of her. I think Miss Swindoll is downright wrong on this one. She claims you don't have to like them, but you should continue to honor and respect them. She doesn't mention abusive, manipulative, controlling parents who make your life miserable. (If you are dealing with parents of this type, try ""Boundaries"" by Cloud and Townsend and ignore Miss Swindoll's advice.<br /><br />Luci goes one to talk about being on time, taking Jesus everywhere, keeping your work, reading your Bible everyday, value what you have, allow yourself to be sad, writing down important things, establishing integrity in your life, thinking before you speak, and so on. None of this is new. None of this is more than any of us have been told all our lives. Honestly, it seems like this book is Luci's baby. She's telling all the motherly advice in book form that she never got to personally share as a mother. I just can't see how this is helpful.<br /><br />I really didn't like this book. This feel good, superficial, common-sense reading just isn't for me. Maybe there is an audience for this somewhere, it just isn't found in me.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com book review bloggers program.

"I have owned several of these ""Dummies"" books, but on this one, I had to ask myself why I bothered. This book has nothing new or revolutionary to offer.

"This book, I thought, had promise. Boy was I wrong. This book is really two books in one. One is the actual story, following a guy named Ben in a world full of zombies. The second is the devotional book that uses the fictional story as a lesson about the state of our souls.<br /><br />First, from a theological standpoint, Kinley is coming from a different place than I am. He assumes a lot in his theology that I just wouldn't say is so. You may find yourself starting from the same assumptions he does, in which case you'll probably follow along better with the devotional aspect of the book. I just found the theological difference to be too much for me to get anything from the book devotionally. (I am free church Wesleyan, if that makes a difference to you.)<br /><br />Second, the allegory is such a stretch. And Kinley tries to make it all so literal and really stretch it. It just doesn't work well and feels very stretched and very manipulated.<br /><br />Third, the story is lacking. If you are reading it for the fictional zombie story, don't bother. Kinley isn't the best story teller. Character development is what you'd expect reading an amateur's novel. The plot doesn't even make sense at times, because it is being stretched to fit the allegory.<br /><br />Overall, the book was not enjoyable at all on any level. I didn't enjoy the story telling aspect. I didn't enjoy the devotional aspect.",Negative
"I'm generally a fan of zombie books. I didn't think it was possible for a book about zombies to be boring. This must be the new thing. Take something as exciting as the end of human life on this planet and make it seem boring compared to your real life now. There is very little action in the book. What little there is is interrupted with the main character waxing poetic about his drab life before zombies were trying to eat him for breakfast. He even makes the initial zombie outbreak seem like a boring day in middle school. Add the boring, yet poetic, writing with no chapter breaks and I could barely make it through this novel. Very little actually happens in the book. Maybe this book will appeal to the types who adore reading page after page of poetic nonsense. It does not appeal to zombie lovers like myself.",Negative
"Yes, my daughter loved the book. It has My Little Ponies in it. Not hard to make her like that. I think the book was extremely lacking. It is not a Beginning Reader at all. They replaced some words in the story with pictures. The words were too difficult for a Level 1 reader to read. This is just a cheap picture book with the word ""reader"" slapped on it so the extremely lacking plot would sell. A Level 1 Beginning Reader should contain simple words, repeating letter sequences, and repeating phrases. This book fails in all those areas. Yes, little girls will like it because it has My Little Ponies in it. But it really has zero educational value, which would be the entire point of a Beginning Reader.",Negative
"This book is cute. My daughter loves it. She loves My Little Ponies. Not a hard sell, there. However, this book is written to be a Level 1 Beginning Reader. A Level 1 book should contain simple words, repeating letter patterns, and repeating phrases. This book has none of those things. Taking out words in the book and putting pictures in their place does not make it a Level 1 Reader. This book contains words that are very difficult for a beginning reader to read. This book is for the child fluent in reading, not a beginner. I'm very disappointed in the quality of Readers. They slap a popular character on the book and write a lack-luster story and say it is a Beginning Reader. It isn't. It is a cheap picture book with a lacking story line. Yes, my daughter liked the book. But no, she couldn't even come close to reading it.",Negative
"The premise of this book was a good one. A book to tell women all those weird pregnancy things and assure you they are okay. However, Vicki chose to go a different route. She is very clearly against natural childbirth and takes a mocking tone toward it. According to the book she only knows two women who tried ""natural"" childbirth and they both ended up with c-sections and regretted trying. Every one of her birth stories is about someone's failed attempt at childbirth. This book is full of terrible advice. Despite what this book says, you can get to the hospital too early.  Despite what this book says, all doctors are not good doctors. Despite what this book says, many women have a medication free childbirth. Despite what this book says, many studies show that being AWAY from the hospital and doctors is safer. Despite what this book says, you do get to have a say in your pregnancy and childbirth, even if it is your first baby. This book sets up the idea that childbirth is unbearable and you should be scared and therefore get an epidural or just schedule your c-section. The author also claims that exercise during pregnancy will have no effect on your labor and delivery. Maybe Vicki is just ill-informed. Or maybe she want to change the birth climate so everyone has disappointing births where they felt no control. Either way, this book is one of the worst pregnancy books on the market.",Negative
"This book is poorly written. The author takes much time setting up scenarios and building characters only to have them fizzle out in the most uninteresting ways. Boring. The author gives you all this build up, and then there is this dud of a climax that leaves you thinking, ""This is it?"" The book is a giant bore.<br />I also did not appreciate the author's tone toward the former president. I mean, that in and of itself dated the book. I also did not appreciate the semi-spiritual but agnostic tone of the book. It was anti-Christian, which I do not like.<br />For parents: The book has no foul language. There are a few references to sex, but nothing in detail. It is anti-Christian and agnostic in its tone.",Negative
"I found the story itself to be fascinating. I actually wanted to see where it was going. However, the writing was not particularly good. In fact, there are many gaps where you have to just piece the story together. (And not in the clever way- it just felt disjointed and thoughtless.) There was nothing special in the way it was written- in fact, I happened to like the story despite the way it was written. However, I won't be reading more by this author.<br />I was also disappointed with the foul language. If you are a parent, know this book contains underage drinking & smoking. It also deals with homosexuality and teen sexuality (in a very, very small capacity). The main character is also a high school drop out, though that seems neither condemned nor condoned in the book.",Negative
"My all-time best friend of some 50 years gave me the book (autographed by Steve) as a birthday gift.  And much appreciated it was, too.  But sometimes we can learn too much about our pop culture icons.  What's the old adage, ""Kill Your Idols?""  Still, I'm forever grateful to Mr. Van Zandt for accomplishing the impossible by bringing the original Rascals together once again (miraculous!) about 10 years ago for the wonderful ""Once Upon a Dream"" concert / show.  It was one of the greatest Broadway experiences of my life, no kidding!  The fact that the guys ultimately blew the reunion tour and scattered off once again into the winds of rock 'n' roll time was a major disappointment.  However, reading Steven's recollections about their pettiness and backstabbing ways (with the exception of Eddie Brigati, the truest of the boys to the Rascals' peace, love & brotherhood ideals) really broke my lifelong Rascals fan heart.  For me, it was the truest and most emotional segment of the entire memoir.  The rest?  Well, sometimes a great second banana should simply remain a great second banana rather than blather on and come across as a raging egotist.  Reminds me of the late, great Beach Boy Dennis Wilson quote, ""Had it not been for my brother Brian, Mike Love would still be pumping gas for a living.""  Substitute Bruce for Brian and Stevie for Mike and you'll catch my drift.  Disappointing, and ultimately sad.",Negative

"Geez! What's all the hype about?? Absolutely nothing happened! This is like soft-core-faux-porn for housewives that had a herd of babies in their 20's instead of exploring and discovering who their sexual selves are (in a healthy and safe way of course!!)

But nope! That definitely did not happen!<br />Additionally, I am forgiving of first-time published authors, however, there was so much ramble, so much unnecessary detail (and none at all where it counts) and repetition of adjectives often on the same page that I'd be hard pressed to even consider reading this author in the future.",Negative

"The bear-shaped board book ""edition"" is NOT the Corduroy story. It shouldn't even be listed as the same book. The original story is cute and poignant, and I highly recommend it. But the board book has no real narrative; it is just a list of things that Corduroy does one day. There are no other characters, no dialogue, no conflict or issues, no rhyming, nothing but ""Corduroy is mailing some letters."" and ""Corduroy takes a bath. Look at all the bubbles.""  The illustrations, while nice, aren't original -- they were culled from other Corduroy books.<br /><br />The book is cute enough, and my 17-month old daugther loves it because it's oversized and bear-shaped. But I was disappointed not to get the actual Corduroy story, and would not have bought it if I'd known what it was. All that said, if your child already knows and likes the original Corduroy book, this might be a nice companion.",Negative

"Entertaining intrigue set in 1952 Batista Havana. Cantor is on a mission where gaining a favor from Myer Lansky himself plays a role. A hardboiled noir with super tough lesbian who get roughed up regularly. Sadly the violence in chapter 16 killed my pleasure in the book and Cantor. Others who enjoy violence against the helpless will get a charge out of it. Even Cantor hated herself after it so there is that.<br /><br />It all started with the first book in the series 2014's Criminal GOld: Midnight, New York Harbor, 1949. Cantor Gold, dapper dyke-about-town, smuggler of fine art, waits in her boat under the Brooklyn Bridge for racketeer Gregory Ortine. In the shadow of the bridge, he’ll toss Cantor a satchel of cash, and she’ll toss him a pouch containing a priceless jewel. But the plan, and the jewel, sink when a woman in a red sequined dress drops from the bridge and slams onto Cantor’s boat. She is Opal Shaw, Society Page darling and fiancée of murder-for-hire kingpin Sig Loreale. Through a night of danger, desire, and double-cross, Cantor must satisfy Loreale’s vengeance, stay ahead of an angry Ortine, and untangle the knots of murder tightening around Opal’s best friend and keeper of her dirty secrets, Celeste Copley, a seductress who excites Cantor’s passion but snares her in a labyrinth of lies. The lies explode in a collision of love, loyalty, lust…and death.<br /><br />Book 2: New York City, 1950. Cantor Gold hunts for a missing masterpiece she’s risked her life to bring through the port of New York. She must outsmart the Law that wants to jail her; outrun the dockside gangsters who would let her take the fall for murder; and outplay a shady art dealer, his lover, and a beautiful curator who toys with Cantor’s passion. Through it all, Cantor must stay out of the gunsights of a killer who’s knocking off rivals for the missing masterpiece—and stay alive to solve the mystery of her stolen love: Sophie de la Luna y Sol.<br /><br />Book 3: New York, 1952. From the shadowy docks of Athens, Greece, to the elegance of a Fifth Avenue penthouse, to the neon glare of Coney Island, art smuggler Cantor Gold must track down an ancient artifact, elude thugs and killers, protect a beautiful woman who caters to Cantor's deepest desires, and confront the honky-tonk past which formed her. Memories, murder, passion, and the terrible longing for her stolen love tangle in Cantor's soul, threatening to tear her apart.",Negative

That being said, 80% of the reviewers loved it.  Maybe it comes down to I found all the elements when combined so unbelievable, while taken individually I could see them all happening.",Negative
"A compelling story that never took off for me. Jillian James is a complete mystery, her back story and how she came to be in a small Texas town in slowly revealed. The author had me intrigued to know that happened to her father and why she was always on the run. I also liked how Jillian was so polite to strangers.  I found it a slog to keep reading after the mayor of the town found a 15 year old boy beaten to a pulp and didn't call the police. then the mayor found a young boy shivering and crying in the cold and never said a word when he found the father but did find time to reward the father for using the mayor's empty building for his personal use; instead the mayor offered him the opportunity to start a business and offered to rehab the building for free.

And however glad I was to have the chance to read this author and this novel - it just wasn't for me because in the end it didn't fulfill for me the premise: ""Set over fifty years and in four countries backdropped by different wars, The Woman Who Lost Her Soul is a magnum opus that brings to life, through the mystique and allure of history, an intricate portrait of catastrophic events that led up to the war on terror and the America we are today."" Sounded fabulous to me. 2013 Best Book of the Year for Publishers Weekly, Kirkus, Library Journal, O Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, NPR & The Oregonian. Yet I think the title of the book is more apt if it where ""The woman who never had a chance at a soul because the men in her life, starting with her incestuous father, kept ripping it from her"". I don't know about the device of not using quotation marks to indicate speaking it just made this difficult to read novel more difficult.<br /><br />After finishing the novel I found this brilliant NYT review ""The Unquiet Americans Bob Shacochis's `Woman Who Lost Her Soul'"" By AMY WILENTZ Published: September 20, 2013<br /><br />A ten minute interview of the author for NPR was illuminating ""Shacochis Spans Generations In 'The Woman Who Lost Her Soul'""<br />AUGUST 31, 2013<br /><br />This is the author's first novel in 20 years:<br /><br />Fiction:<br />Easy in the Islands (1985)<br />The Next New World (1990)<br />Swimming in the Volcano (1993)<br /><br />Nonfiction:<br />Drinking, Smoking and Screwing: Great Writers on Good Times (1994)<br />Domesticity: A Gastronomic Interpretation of Love (1994)<br />The Immaculate Invasion (1999)<br />Conversations with Cuba (2001)",Negative
"I also think it should have been translated by a Kiwi (New Zealander).

Helen Davenport, governess for a wealthy London household, longs for a family of her own--but nearing her late twenties, she knows her prospects are dim. Then she spots an advertisement seeking young women to marry New Zealand's honorable bachelors and begins an affectionate correspondence with a gentleman farmer. When her church offers to pay her travels under an unusual arrangement, she jumps at the opportunity. Meanwhile, not far away in Wales, beautiful and daring Gwyneira Silkham, daughter of a wealthy sheep breeder, is bored with high society. But when a mysterious New Zealand baron deals her father an unlucky blackjack hand, Gwyn's hand in marriage is suddenly on the table. Her family is outraged, but Gwyn is thrilled to escape the life laid out for her. The two women meet on the ship to Christchurch--Helen traveling in steerage, Gwyn first class--and become unlikely friends. When their new husbands turn out to be very different than expected, the women must help one another find the life--and love-- they'd hoped for.<br /><br />The song of the Maori. 2008 ISBN 978-3-404-15867-6.<br />The reputation of the Kiwis. 2009 ISBN 978-3-404-16261-1.<br />Kauri Trilogy:<br />The gold of the Maori. 2010 ISBN 978-3-7857-6024-6.<br />In the shadow of the kauri tree.  2011 ISBN 978-3-7857-6047-5.<br />The tears of the Maori goddess. 2012 ISBN 978-3-7857-6058-1.<br />New Zealand Saga II:<br />The time of the fire flowers.  2013.

"Not what I was looking for in a devotional at Christmas - too hard hitting.  Reading some reviews and still not sure? I was the same until I found a video of the author from 2013 by searching &#34;The Rev. Quinn Caldwell&#34; United Church of Christ.<br /><br />The book includes:<br />&#62; a brief prayer for each morning and evening during the entire Christmas season<br />&#62; a calendar with one easy task to do each day<br /><br />I was not familiar with the author, the video I found was posted by the United Church of Christ. I was not familiar with the UCC and the info I found on Wikipedia was helpful:<br /><br />&#34;The United Church of Christ (UCC) is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination primarily in the Reformed tradition, in historical continuation of the General Council of Congregational Christian churches founded under the influence of New England Puritanism. The Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957 to form the UCC. These two denominations, which were themselves the result of earlier unions, had their roots in Congregational, Christian, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. The UCC's 5,154 congregations claim 998,906 members, primarily in the United States. The UCC maintains full communion with other mainline Protestant denominations. Many of its congregations choose to practice open communion.The denomination places high emphasis on participation in worldwide interfaith and ecumenical efforts.The national settings of the UCC have historically favored liberal views on social issues, such as civil rights, LGBT rights, women's rights, and abortion rights. However, United Church of Christ congregations are independent in matters of doctrine and ministry and may not necessarily support the national body's theological or moral stances. It is self-described as &#34;an extremely pluralistic and diverse denomination&#34;.&#34;",Negative
"Awesome book Club choice! If you go into this not expecting the characters to be grounded in reality I think it can be entertaining. I think I was disappointed because I found drop dead gorgeous veterinarian Harriet who goes by ""Harry"" (a name I don't like for a man let alone a woman), and Sarah both unbelievable, Sarah was worse because she is a surgeon at the age of 33 who leaves the big city to become a general practitioner in the Australian outback and her first 4 hours in country she was completely unprepared for the life and reacted like a hysterical 16 year old on her first drive from the airport. Harry was just too good to be true - she has many skills however driving the outback in a safe vehicle is not one of them. It goes on from there. The plot with Harry's father and mother and how Sarah reacts, in fact all the family interactions were unique.",Negative
"Debut Author - Contemporary Traditional Lesbian Romance. I will definitely look forward to this author's next book as she has a flair for storytelling. I just didn't empathize with any of the characters, except the adult son of on of the main characters.<br /><br />52 year old Ellie, a successful artist, lives in the farmhouse inherited from her parents.<br /><br />42 year old Robin, is Ellie's business partner and philandering lover of 18 years. Ellie has never let Robin's affairs stop her love for Robin. Robin is not able to do the same when Ellie has an affair with Kathryn the previous year *no spoilers, we learn this in chapter one*. Robin left, is having an affair with Jasmine, and has now returned physically but not romantically. The farm house starts to get a little full then Jasmine, Aiden (Ellie's 30 y/o son), g/f Sophie, and Kathryn all arrive, separately, one afternoon. It made for fascinating reading, almost like a reality show.<br /><br />Being a fan of historical fiction, the mystery of whose royal resting place is disturbed at Starling Hill was tremendously enjoyable and I learned of an important figure in British history.<br /><br />Interested in a little more? search &#34;A Journey to Publication by Jen Silver&#34; for an author interview.<br /><br />A review in Cruve Magazine: &#34;A great first novel woven from romance, intrigue and humor, set in the north of England and full of English charm.&#34; BY THE VELVET LOUNGER<br /><br />And this summary on the publisher' web site:<br /><br />&#34;Ellie Winters hasn't always had an easy life in the past. Even now her life, although it's in order, isn't running smoothly. It's about to get even bumpier too. Ellie lives on a remote farm on Starling Hill that she inherited from her deceased parents. She lives with her recently ex lover, Robin Fanshawe.<br /><br />&#34;Robin loves the ladies, lots of them and has been unfaithful to Ellie on numerous occasions, which is why they are no longer lovers. They do have a truce though, none of Robin's women are to visit the farm. Unfortunately a woman Robin has been seeing is about to shatter their pact when she arrives on the farm to stay. This is the beginning of a chain of events which will change both Ellie and Robin's lives forever.<br /><br />&#34;Archaeologist, Professor Doctor Kathryn Moss, Ellie's ex lover, also arrives on the farm, hoping Ellie will allow her and her team of university students to begin a dig in her field. Ellie agrees. But, will the field be the only thing being dug up? Or will Kathryn and Ellie dig up their past relationship putting an end forever into Ellie and Robin's truce and any hopes of a reconciliation?<br /><br />&#34;Will Robin realize the error of her ways and infidelities and put her `love them and leave them' past behind her? Will Ellie even consider having Robin back in her life as her lover?<br /><br />&#34;Who is the royal buried on Starling Hill?<br /><br />&#34;History, romance, intrigue, mystery, infidelity, love and loss are all entwined together in this wonderfully well written, fast paced, debut romance from the pen of new lesfic author Jen Silver.<br /><br />&#34;I had the pleasure of reading a short story written by Jen and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought from reading that story that Jen would be capable of great things. Now I know for sure she's capable of great things having read and thoroughly enjoyed her debut novel. I found myself flying through the pages at break neck speed to find out how the story ended. Which was okay, because I then started the book again and read it more slowly to make notes for this review. No surprises that I enjoyed it just as much, if not more the second time round when I could savor the story properly.<br /><br />&#34;My favorite character was Ellie. Long suffering until she took charge of her life. Once she did, Robin found herself on the other side of the fence finding out what Ellie had put up with for years. I don't want to go into any details of the story, or put in any spoilers. But suffice it to say, that this book is an emotionally charged roller coaster of ups and downs, twists and turns. Angst one minute and laugh out loud the next.<br /><br />&#34;This is a story which grabbed me from the beginning. Both Ellie and Robin have their faults and flaws. It's their journey on the path of love in this story that shows how love can conquer almost anything. But, it also shows that relationships have to be worked on and the course of true love doesn't always run smoothly.",Negative
"My root issue is the main character comes off as irritating. The story is predictable yet confusing, too many coincidences, the interactions were forced, the dialogue was constantly hostile or belligerent or both. To paraphrase WC Fields: In the end, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.<br /><br />I think folks who watch paranoia based news will enjoy this. Or you have to enjoy when need to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />* the author of the David Trevellyan novels, Even (2009), Die Twice (2010), More Harm Than Good (2012). Not to be confused with New Zealander by the same name who has written 2 Danial Swann thriller novels Death in the Kingdom & Singapore Slingshot.",Negative
My dad would have loved the movie - lol. The reading was a bit rough going (perhaps something the translation could have salvaged?). The dialogue didn't seem natural but maybe it was my reading in reaction to the horror in the novel.,Negative
"If flash-fiction is your thing this book is for you. If stories of taboo or shocking subjects are your groove you will probably enjoy this collection of 26 stories, most are bleak, heartily.

Yeah, just not for me.<br /><br />""THIS WOMAN HAS A VOICE LIKE WHAT I IMAGINE BUTTERSCOTCH WOULD SOUND LIKE WERE IT NOT THE HARDENED DIARRHEAL TURD I AM CONVINCED IT TO BE."" page 171<br /><br />On the plus side I have not felt so disturbed about the fate of the human race since I read Orwell's '1984'.

"I am a HUGE Disney Fan. Except for the cover it doesn't have a very Disney feel. My strong recommendation is take advantage of the preview option and see for yourself. I think it would be ok for children ages 7 to 10, but would be more enjoyable in a school than a fun read at home. The content is rather dry and simplistic and the graphics are something I don't think Mr. Disney would be excited about.",Negative
"Nadia and Jessica fall in love while Nadia is in college and Jessica works in burlesque. The attraction is so great that Jessica comes clean with Nadia and tells Nadia that she has a boyfriend that she didn't tell Nadia about but she broke up with him last night. Not the best start for a relationship but doesn't seem to bother Nadia. Jessica and Nadia get married. Nadia doesn't like it that Jessica drinks and pressures her to stop. Jessica does, except she is spiking her beverages with booze and keeping it a secret. Nadia accidentally finds out. They both freak. It get worse. much worse. Jessica is clearly an alcoholic, but get this Nadia doesn't want her to label herself an alcoholic - that would be demeaning (I kid you not). Nadia is so caught up on what people think she ruins her life, Jessica ruins her own life. I liked Jessica more than I liked Nadia. I felt Nadia was the most self centered person I have met in a long time, with the maturity of a 16 year old. Ruby, Ruby with the terrific grandfather. She knowingly gets involved with this train wreck couple because she wants Nadia bad, real bad.<br /><br />The author has a wonderful way with dialogue. The story was all over the place. I would try this author again based on the about 30 fabulous reviews. This title just left me cold and sad.",Negative
"I wanted to enjoy it, truly I did. Robert B. Parker was my all time favorite go to author. I truly mourned his passing. No one could equal him at writing his own characters but I wanted to give this a try figuring his estate couldn't possibly let dreck be published in his name.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I got to the end of the first chapter and couldn't go on. It was nothing like Mr. Parker, nothing at all. Traitorous and sophomoric.  There is probably better fan written fiction for free on the internet. I just don't understand, although I am truly happy for the reviewers who rate it 3, 4 & 5 stars - I wish I could have.",Negative

"If you want to read a book about sexual escapades, this is the book for you.  If you prefer a little plot with your books, pass on this one.  Had this been the first Laurell Hamilton book that I had read, I would never have picked up another.  The early Anita Blake books were excellent, however I think the writer has begun to believe that all we readers want are sex fantasies.  That has made up more and more of her latest books. The action was always the best part, there really was none in this.  This one was just pure trash.",Negative
"Not very well written—plot line drags. By the last quarter of the book, I just didn’t care anymore & donated it to goodwill without even finishing it.",Negative
"I love Creole & Cajun cuisine and I was excited to get this book. I know a little about this style of cooking though I have limited experience with it. When this book came I dug in and was eager – at first. This may very well be a good book, but my copy is marred by a terrible print run that leaves some of it hard to read at best and headache-inducing at worst.<br /><br />Leafing through I found multiple pages that did not print properly and the print is doubled. I have included two pics with my review to show what I mean. Oddly enough, the double print seems to be very random; sometimes the print is screwed up in half of a paragraph and is corrected later in the same paragraph (and on occasion within a sentence). Sometimes the recipe text is fine but the title and ingredients are fouled. The printing error seems to impact about a third of the book. At its worst, the print somewhat resembles the red/blue 3-D print style.<br /><br />Oddly enough, there are full-color photos in the book and all of them are just fine. I would have thought the opposite to be more likely the case.<br /><br />I should be very clear – this is not the author’s fault, it is the fault of the printing company that produced the final hard copy of the book. And, hopefully, this is a single case and not true of the whole run.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book and my excitement turned to deep disappointment. The recipes and writing seem to be good, and I can use some of the book, but unfortunately a really bad print run makes this book less than good. If you choose this book, look through it carefully for print errors.",Negative
"I selected this novel with the hopes of being taken on a journey to a faraway place, on an adventure that would hold my interest and give me something to think about when I finished it. Unfortunately, it is a book that I have been unable to finish due to the writing style and characters I do not like. It is a good effort, and it is a fairly immersive story, but I will be blunt and say I just didn’t like it enough to finish it.<br /><br />The basic premise is a post-apocalypse world where one man with foresight has prepared an escape for himself, his family and a select group of friends and acquaintances, aboard a ship that is stocked well enough to support the relatively small group aboard. This is a similar plot to the short story “Mayflower II” by Stephen Baxter, about an escape from earth using a starship after an invasion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the The Ship does not borrow enough from Mayflower II. Some reviewers have stated that the writing is good, but I find the style to be choppy, hard to follow and very disjoint at times. Worse, I do not like the majority of the characters in this novel, who are either naive to the point of painful, arrogant or just downright obnoxious.<br /><br />I confess that I did not finish this book. I tried to like it and I tried to be objective as I read...I really, really tried.<br /><br />I like the premise of the book and think the storyline had a lot of promise. Unfortunately, I feel it was let down by uneven writing and unlikable characters. Others may like this book more than I did; this proved not to be to my tastes and based on my time with it I am slow to recommend it.",Negative
Do not buy this book if you are hoping to teach your child about the different types of trains. The pictures are not the greatest as well.,Negative
Disappointing. This is not a traditional Sesame Street story where the story is told by the chatacter. The story is somewhat abstract and uses words not relateable to a toddler.

"I wish I was able to get through the book, but I lost interest about halfway through. The plot sounded really interesting, but the writing style was too ""young drama"" for me. I'd expect the book to be next to the Twilight series, nothing wrong with it, just not my style. I tend to expect more, or something more mature, of my usual Science Fiction & Fantasy. Unfortunately Scent of Darkness just doesn't belong there. The craft behind creating scent was fascinating but the rest was just too immature for me.",Negative
"At first, I really liked Feng, and felt myself hoping for better things in her life. But as the story went on, and Feng became more bitter, twisted, and narcissistic, I felt myself disliking her intensely. It also seemed quite unbelievable that her personality would change so abruptly. This in turn, affected my enjoyment of the book. Sadly, the book was quite a disappointment.",Negative
"I really wanted to like this book. The message that a parent will love their child no matter how frustrated they get was so touching, yet completely derailed by the mother's later unhealthy, obsessive exhibits of her love. Sneaking across town and into your grown child's house is not a healthy way to show love. Metaphor or not the author could have shown the steadfastness of parental love throughout time in a much better way. I'd recommend Lisa McCourt's ""The Most Thankful Thing"" instead of this book.",Negative

"I'm so disappointed in this book. I thought it would make a great gift for another dog lover friend of mine, one who is always sending me cute dog cartoons. But I thought I would pick up a used copy for myself first so I could actually read them. Perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough for the New Yorker brand of humor. Most of the cartoons contained in this book do not resonate with me at all.  Perhaps I'm exceptionally slow, but some I don't even understand. I find very few of them at all funny. Some, seem to me, to be at the expense of dogs. I doubt if most of these are actually written and drawn by dog lovers; it feels more like insensitive people trying to appear witty. There is a fairly large variety in this book, so you might find something that you like. I found a couple. But overall, I found this collection extremely disappointing.

"I've been devouring Freida McFadden's books since becoming a Kindle Unlimited member a few months ago. I've ALWAYS loved to read and adding a new author to my list of favorites is something that I honestly LOVE to do.  I added Freida McFadden to my list of favorites after I read one of her books for the first time and my love for her books grows with each book that I read.<br /><br />Except this one.<br /><br />What I liked about the book:  I like that all 6 main characters told a story from their perspective.  I also like that by the time the book ends, we know what happened to all of the main characters. There is closure. I appreciate that.<br /><br />**************  SPOILER ALERT!  Stop reading if you don't want to know details about what happens in this book!<br /><br />What I didn't like:  It didn't take long before I wondered how on earth Heather made it into medical school. The girl had NO clue what she was doing.  And then Abe, a doctor, didn't know what a PET scan was??? Come on. But that was the least of Abe's problems. The man had the eye of his twin on his butt along with some of his twin's brain inside of him...his twin's FUNCTIONING brain!  And Mason...straight A , confident Mason. Normal one day, a nutjob the next. I'm not even quite sure what happened to him and when it happened! Suddenly, he's  a whack job. Dr. Conlon was a good man...a man who wanted his students to excel and be the best doctors possible. Never hesitated to offer help/help them.  After all he'd been through, he finally found love with Rachel and then got his head blown off....again.  Because of his love an encouragement, Rachel became a new person and changed her ways, only to lose him. That sucked. And I still have no clue who the damn janitor was!<br /><br />It pains me to say this, but Suicide Med was the equivalent of a made for TV Lifetime movie. I didn't like it very much. I wanted to, I tried to, but couldn't.  By no means does that mean I will stop reading Freida McFadden books. I absolutely will NO do that! I still love her and will continue to devour her books! As for Suicide Med, well, I just cannot recommend it.",Negative
"I'm a huge fan of Mark Edwards but this book wasn't my 'cup of tea'.  I felt no connection to any of the characters (except the cat) and didn't really care what happened to anyone.

"I miss John Grisham.  I miss the John Grisham from 25 years ago.  I miss the John Grisham whose books were MUST READ. I miss the John Grisham whose books I literally would take a day off of work for when his latest book arrived in stores, be at the mall when it opened so I could grab a copy from B. Dalton or Waldenbooks and then go home and devour it on one sitting.  That John Grisham hasn't been around for a LONG time now.  His past couple of books have been so disappointing, I no longer anticipate their release.  When I have nothing else to read, then I break down and read his latest.  But I won't buy them hard cover like I used to.  Whatever the cheapest method is...paperback, Kindle or $.47 at the local Goodwill.  Because now his books are amateurish.  I could care less if I read them or not. IDK why I thought I would enjoy The Rooster Bar.  I didn't very much.  It felt very rushed to me.  I used to read his books in one sitting, straight through. This one took me 3 weeks to get through and I had to force myself to finish it .<br /><br />Come back, John Grisham. Please come back and write MUST READ books again.  I miss you and I miss saying "" I didn't see that coming!!!"" when I read your books.",Negative
"Its official. The John Grisham writer we had in the 90's who wrote the books that we just had to read from cover to cover nonstop is gone. LONG gone.  His books have gone downhill over the years but The Whistler is his 'rock bottom'.<br /><br />Boring.  Predictable.  And it almost pains me to use the word 'predictable' to describe this book because that was always my favorite thing about Grisham. His books were NEVER predicitable.  I can't tell you how many times I read his (earlier) books and when I finished reading (from cover to cover without taking a break!) I would say to myself &#34; I did NOT see that ending coming!&#34;.<br /><br />Those days are LONG gone.  The Whistler could have been written by anyone.  Its simple. Its boring. Its predictable.  I used to read his books from cover to cover in a matter of hours. This one literally took me nearly a month to get through.  I didn't care if I didn't read it for a few days or even a week at a time.  In fact, I even started and finished another book by another author while in the middle of reading The Whistler. That's how dull it was.<br /><br />I didn't care about the characters.  Never felt a 'bond' or a 'connection' with them. I could have cared less who lived and who died. And it certainly didn't take long to figure out who was behind the plan to bring down the judge.<br /><br />I'm also getting a bit tired of Grisham lecturing about racism in his recent books.  The first half of this book spent a decent amount of time criticizing whites for being racist.  (Yes, I'm well aware that Grisham is white)  I also don't know why he feels the need to repeatedly make comments about a character's weight? He did that in some of his recent books and also made a point of criticizing a minor character's weight (Verna) in this  one too.  (No, I am not overweight.  I just don't understand the purpose of him bringing weight issues into all of his books)<br /><br />Save your money.  At least wait until this is out in paperback because it is NOT worth the cost of hardcover.  This was incredibly disappointing and just plain boring.",Negative

No laughs here. The characters were cardboard. Such a disappointment. If she no longer wants to do the Plum series, and only concentrate on her other books, which I don't care for at all, then she needs to marry off Plum to one of the two, but I am not buying or reading any more Plum because I had to force myself to try and finish this in the hope it would get funny. The ending was horrible. Shame, it was a funny series until I guess she no longer wanted to do the books.",Negative
"The first pages have you assaulted by so many names that you are dizzy... Are all those names important? No. I was so confused as I wondered what importance, if any, were all these faceless names. Then 'Jade' (hmm, how many FBI agents are named Jade when compared to the same name of exotic dancers?). Anyway, she goes to her new position and we get more names! I guess I fell for the monthly 'Amazon Reads' again, choosing a most likely self-published story that I lost interest in by page 20. One easy tell about novice writers is that they choose such ridiculous names for their characters. And names are only important if these characters will continue on through the story.",Negative
"Immediately it became apparent that the lead character is a lazy, snob with barely any ambition and takes wine and brioche into the mountains while camping. Seriously? I couldn't stand the lead character from the first page. The writing is so boring and the character so obnoxious that I could only get to the part where the main character meets an old man that asks if he is an earthling and has seen the flying saucer. Okay, I give up, life is too short to read something that is ridiculous and a waste of one's time. Those titles of the author I put on my wish list? They've been deleted.",Negative
"I am angry. Angry that all these 5 star reviews couldn't possibly be about this book. I read the reviews and thought this would be a real page turner. The characters are so one dimensional that a reader couldn't possibly care about them one way or another. The title is misleading. It should have been 'Aubrey & the strangler'. The 'lineman' in this story is Gil and except for a brief excerpt from Glen Campbell's 'Wichita Lineman', you have no idea what Gil really does in his job. Not any insight into this lineman's life unless it is with Aubrey. It's all about Aubrey. As for the characters. they have no emotion, realism and depth. I have never been negative when it comes to writers, because I know how hard it is to be published (well, it used to be hard).<br />When reading a book, the reader should be taken inside of it, feeling what the characters feel. I could not have cared less about these characters. As for being a page turner, they turned whenever I dropped the book as I dozed off while waiting for the emotion, the thrill, the anything. The title totally deceived me and that angers me that I paid for this based on reviews.",Negative
"The book should have been entitled Whine. While we feel sympathy for those struggling this gal complains about everything and everybody.

Hope it ends well for her and her child.",Negative

I give Mr. Trump all the more credit for letting your snide remark slide. You betray the whole theme of your books by doing this. I've come to expect this from certain media but not you.

"From the start something didn't sit right with me.  The author wanted to reach her audience about domestic violence and verbal abuse but she sets up this book with two over achieving women. Leah, a lawyer and McKenna a pediatric Doctor. They both have busy jobs, busy lives, intelligent, well liked, many friends and yet out of the blue their husband's tell them they can't work anymore and they become imprisoned in their homes. Yet, they still have cars to drive away. And then again, this author wants us to take her serious but allows these women to kill each other's husband's to make it all go away. Is this the advice she's giving the victims of domestic violence? Because it's not that easy. Or we would all be doing it for everything men are guilty of. I know the book is fiction but when the author takes herself so seriously but uses the wrong characters to be in that position and then the men get to die, what really are you telling us.",Negative
"I almost put this book down after the first chapter for its rambling writing but eventually hung on for the whole ride. There really isn't any plot to this book, just the main character, Vivian and all of her thoughts and feelings past and present. She isn't very likable, she's destructive, she's mean and yet is also narcissistic and sleeps around. The last two chapters show she may turn herself around but I never cared to begin with. Author sounds like she shares some of these thoughts her character does, or turn it around and gives some dirty jabs to white women. The problems she describes belongs to all races and for her to separate it by black and white shows a lack knowledge and empathy for anyone other than the black race. I am not interested in reading anything else that she writes.",Negative

"How many times can someone in the book say the word ""bleeding""? Try 103! How about the word ""skies""? 128! Come up with some new curse words if someone needs to curse at all, for Pete's sake!<br /><br />Laia<br />The biggest problem I've had with Laia is her age. I can't remember if it was explicitly mentioned in the first book or not, but she's always seemed like a 12-year-old to me. She acts and sounds like one. So when two grown men want to sleep with her, it throws me for a loop. I had the same problem through the first entire book. I can't reconcile a 17 year old Laia (which is what she's supposed to be, I'm guessing? Or something like that?) with the 11 or 12 year old that I envision.<br />Laia's constant bad decisions are just inexplicable. How many people have to die just because she says so? Because she orders people around on what they should or should not do and as a result so many more innocent people die. She makes the situation about her own conscience rather than what is really going on around her with the other people and her terrible decisions lead to disaster after disaster.<br />And her personality is grating. She's selfish and nothing particularly special and for the life of me I can't figure out why people respect her much less gravitate toward or love her. The love triangle is downright annoying. Why is there a love triangle at all? The ""attraction"" with Keenan was fake fake fake from the very beginning. He seemed to ""fall"" for Laia after spending ten minutes with her. With Elias it was more reasonable--at least in the first book they spent an entire night talking with each other. But Keenan falling head over heels for a girl he doesn't even know is suspicious from the start--as it should've been when all is revealed--but that doesn't explain Laia's blatant naivete about him. All I could keep thinking was, ""you're seriously falling for this?"" Gag me.<br /><br />Elias<br />I like Elias. He was strong in the first book. In this book he's poisoned at the beginning and that's pretty much it for the relevance of his story line. It's really lame and sad. He gets beat and beat and beat and winds up in one type of prison after another. After this really unsatisfying ending I hope something gets reconciled for him or else he really got shafted.<br /><br />Helene<br />Helene's chapters were probably the best, but she gets beat down constantly as well. She can never make the right decision and pays dearly for it. It's a really sad ending for her that is undeserved.<br /><br />The second book was brutally violent (like the first) and you're constantly beat down so severely it makes it difficult to keep reading.<br /><br />Dear Author, YOUR READERS NEED A BREAK.<br />It's exhausting reading about defeat after defeat and bad choice after bad choice. I'm glad I am able to borrow these from the library or else I definitely wouldn't keep reading after this book. I may not have even bought the second if I'd had to.",Negative
"Slow and boring. The only reason why I made it through this book is because I told myself I wouldn't read anything else until this was done since I paid for it. Nothing happens in this book. There were a maybe two slightly-intense scenes that were over after one page. The author jumped from person to person so quickly it makes your head spin, and it was hard to keep track who was who. There was no electricity between Salander and Blomkvist, in fact they had hardly anything to do with each other. The author didn't let you inside anyone's heads, including the main characters. It was all very matter-of-factly written, with no emotion to speak of. Overall, a very frustrating and downright boring book to read. If there's another one, I will probably not bother.",Negative
"This book was extremely predictable; there was nothing new or exciting about it.  The writing style was good, but it moved so slowly.  It took me at least three tries to get into the book, and then halfway through I just wanted it to be over.  You can see the direction it's going in about 50 pages in, and I guessed the ending at about page 100.  I usually love to read books over and over, but I can't imagine plodding my way through this one again.  I wish I could have3 a refund.",Negative
"I was making my way through this book, being moderately amused, when I was assaulted by the passage about the brothers experience in Vietnam.  As a young Asian female I felt offended by the heinous images brought to mind and I will no longer be purchasing this authors work.

"The imagery is beautiful.  The card stock is very heavy, and the size of the cards is quite large and long.  My only complaint is that I wasn't well informed before buying this product and didn't realize that the pips are not illustrated with anything other than swords or cups or what have you.  I am used to the imagery of these cards so it is difficult for me to do a reading without it.  ALSO:  my box arrived without any shrink wrap.  On opening, I see that the smaller box the tarot cards comes in has been opened.  When inspecting the cards, they were all out of order and upside down from each other, obviously shuffled and used before.

I should have paid attention to other reviews.  Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel.  If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required.  Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents.  I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it.

My son came out shaking his head, handing me the book, saying &#34;There is no way my school really wants me to read this crap.&#34; Assuming he was trying to make an excuse to get out of reading the book, I picked it up and started to read. All I can say is this is the WORST book I have ever read. If it is an attempt to get black girls/students to read, I am offended. The author perpetuates ugly stereotypes of violence, hyper-active sexual attitudes, sexual pressure, racism and entitlement attitudes, and the assumption that all white girls are 'hoes' and all white boys are rich and looking to add some color to their parties at their parent's beachfront mansions. Disgusting. How dare an author encourage such filth. Don't allow your children to read this book. It is written by a narrow-minded woman using her book series to 'settle some score'.",Negative

Overrated. Unrelatable. Humble brag. Funny stories that don’t make a point. Self centered. The only help for reader are 3 bullet points at the end of the chapter.

It mentions random values on random pieces and then indicates values are pretty much relative anyway.<br />A lot of efforts are made to promote Replacements, Ltd., which shouldn't be a priority for the book.",Negative

"I was disappointed in this book. The actual content was pretty thin, and not very well written. Chapter 1 is a complete waste of time, and actually spends pages explaining what client/server means, what the Web is, and other things that are patently obvious to the supposed audience for this material. I found myself turning to the front to see if this book was written in 1997! You then get nine fairly short chapters with instructions on how to hack a website, more or less; followed by 50 pages of useless padding in the appendices including: an unrelated article co-authored by Whittaker for the IEEE, a detailed list of all the bugs present in their ""sample application,"" and then descriptions of their recommended tools, all of which can easily be found on the Web without paying $22 for this book.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, there are many typos and other problems like incorrect illustrations, making the reader wonder if Addison-Wesley even employs a copy editor. Furthermore, I felt this book was inaccurately named and described. It's really more about rudimentary hacking and protecting your web application against hackers than web quality or web testing. A beginning web developer might do well to read this as a primer on how to create sites and applications with basic security, but as an experienced tester it was of limited use to me.",Negative
"This was quite possibly the worst book I've ALMOST read in a long time. As a fan of MST3K, I really had high hopes for Nelson's book, and why not? The head writer and later host of a really funny show writes a book of reviews of cheesy movies - sounds really promising, doesn't it? Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver.<br />Nelson's book is written in a highly personal style - annoyingly so. We get to hear about his wife, his kids, his house, ad nauseum. The talent for repartee evidenced on his show is absent from his prose, and the jokes consist of abstract remarks that are neither humorous nor creative. The overall tone is that of a man who finds HIMSELF incredibly funny, and who cares what you think?<br />I managed to wade through about the first 30 pages of this stinker before I threw it down in disgust.

"3 Pandas Planting is a book about protecting the planet. It features a countdown, starting with 12 and going down to one and in each instance, the book depicts a number of animals that are engaged in some type of earth friendly activity. For example, 12 crocodiles are carpooling and 11 tigers are turning off faucets. The book continues with this theme all the way to the end when it shows one elephant that is simply enjoying the earth.<br /><br />This book is meant to serve as a reminder to kids that they need to do what they can to be good stewards of the planet. The book touches on different ways to make the earth a better place through conservation of energy, water, and resources. This is all fine and good, but 3 Pandas Planting is a little too basic to accomplish much. The drawings are nice, but all you get on each page is a group of animals and one simple sentence explaining what the animals are doing to protect mother earth. There is no explanation on how to do the action or how it helps. There is just a single sentence and that is it.<br /><br />3 Pandas Planting tries to redeem itself and its lack of information at the end of the book where it offers some family tips on ways to save energy, keep the air clean, conserve water, recycle, and reduce & reuse. There is even a final listing of earth- related events and their dates. This is nice, but why didn't the author try to integrate these tips on each page, in the main body of the book? It would have been much more effective to mention these tips along with each of the actions in the main section of the book. Most kids won't even bother reading this tip section at the end because it is more like an appendix than a part of the book.<br /><br />Teaching kids to recycle, conserve water, etc., are all good ideas and there are some great children's books for getting this message across. Unfortunately, 3 Pandas Planting isn't one of them. The book is weak on both creativity and content and its earth- saving tips at the end is still not enough to save it from mediocrity.",Negative
"Excess consumption is a common occurrence in many western nations, especially in the United States. People are obsessed with the accumulation of merchandise and many will buy things, not because they really need them, but for some other superfluous reason, like keeping up with trends, keeping pace with the accumulation of others, etc. This obsession with owning and accumulating things is evident all around us, and while the recession has slowed the progress a little, it is still a widely agreed on fact that most of us purchase more than we need.<br /><br />Give our penchant for overconsumption, it isn't surprising that some authors have chosen to publish books on this concern and The Story of Stuff is one such book. Author Annie Leonard has observed the accumulation of stuff all around her and she has seen the destruction that this obsession with stuff has had on the environment, on other countries, on health, etc. She is rightfully concerned that this accumulation of so much stuff is going to have long- lasting effects on the human race and the planet if nothing is done to reverse the trend.<br /><br />The Story of Stuff makes some valid points throughout the book relating to stuff and how it impacts each and every one of us. The concerns about excess consumption are valid, and I like the book's proposal that recycling of waste would be best handled at the source instead of at the level of the consumer. The book is also correct in its assessment that excesses and wealth are not what makes most people happy and there is plenty of evidence to back up this and other claims. However, there are other aspects of this book that reduce its overall appeal and while I can certainly sympathize with the book's good intentions, the persuasive strategies it employs are not the best and individuals who support the book's basic philosophy will likely be disappointed that this book doesn't more effectively deliver on its promise. For instance, the book attempts at one point to argue against the need to have so many different consumer choices. People like having lots of choices, so a book must carefully articulate the reasons not to have a plethora of choices if it has any hope to convince the reader. But the best The Story of Stuff can do is claim that it is childish to want so many different choices and that having fewer, better options is more ideal. This rationale isn't going to be enough to persuade very many people. The same is true of the book's recommendation that we all try to purchase goods produced locally. This is a good idea, because it helps keep money local, but the book needs better and more compelling reasons to back its point of view. Admitting that, for example, fresh produce costs more at a local farmer's market but you get the joy of talking to a local farmer isn't going to convince many people to stop shopping at their local discount store, where they would pay less for the same items.<br /><br />Another problem I have is the way the book is written. The book is grammatically correct for the most part, but the style is a little on the elementary side and the author talks to the reader like he/she knows next to nothing about the subject matter at hand. I like that the author intertwines her own experiences throughout the book, and they include some good, eye- opening experiences living in poverty- stricken areas and highly polluted areas. However, she comes across as a little arrogant and preachy. Her point could have been made better with a different approach and more attention to practical, logical, reasons to support her point of view. Then, there is the problem with the book's solutions. Too often, it promotes government force as the only workable means to an end.<br /><br />Materialism and living to excess is an important topic and The Story of Stuff is a book with a good premise and some valid observations. Unfortunately, the book's basic persuasive techniques are not very good and the author too frequently wants to resort to government force to make her will the law of the land. Those who already agree with the author's points will like the book and consider it preaching to the choir, but those who don't will not be persuaded to consider her opinions.",Negative
"Rock and Roll has certainly made its mark on popular culture and among the bands of early rock and roll, the one that achieved the most popularity and caused the most controversy by far was the Beatles. The world was mesmerized by these four young British lads and they enjoyed unparalleled success during their years as a band. Many books have been written about the Beatles and many writers have been fascinated by the tremendous success of this English band. What, exactly, made the Beatles so unique? What caused their popularity to reach such extreme levels? The Lennon Prophecy feels it has found the answer. This book presents a case that proposes that the Beatles success can be traced to John Lennon; not Lennon's musical talent, but rather his association with evil. This book claims that Lennon sold his soul to the devil in exchange for worldly success and it presents clues taken from Beatles albums, Beatles lyrics, and John Lennon's own life as proof that Lennon was, indeed, under the influence of darkness.<br /><br />Some of the evidence presented in this book and the accompanying illustrations are interesting at first and they do seem to back up the book's claims, even if only a little bit. But the majority of the evidence is sketchy at best, and it has obviously been sorted through and selected in order to back the author's objective. Take the evidence about the number nine. The book includes examples of several numbers that correspond to John Lennon (his birth date, time of birth, date of death, etc.) and shows how they can all be tied back to the number nine, which is supposedly a number associated with evil. This is all fine and good, but I would bet that if more numbers relating to John Lennon were examined, there would be plenty that do not add up to nine. By focusing only on those things that do add up to nine, the author tries to prove his point. But if you think about it, this selective process could be conducted on anyone. Most any one of us would have dates and other numbers associated with us that tie back to the number nine, or to any other number.<br /><br />Among this books many omissions, the one that is most glaring is an examination of Lennon's years as an outspoken advocate of peace. John Lennon's anti- war stance and his social activism are widely known and regarded, but the book completely glosses over this important aspect of John Lennon's life. How could the author overlook something this important? I think the reason is obvious. If Lennon really was in league with the devil, then he would have been a minister of death, hoping and praying for war and destruction. But instead, Lennon wanted peace and love to ring loudly throughout the world. This certainly is not becoming of a person who is supposedly Satan's right hand man. Knowing this would contradict his theory, the author excludes it completely from the book. I would have respected the book more if it admitted that Lennon's pro- peace position is at odds with the book's theory and then tried to reconcile it with the rest of the evidence. But the author chose to ignore this completely. And this, once again, shows that the author was cherry- picking evidence to back his claims.<br /><br />The Lennon Prophecy is obviously a very far- fetched book and one that many readers will consider good for a laugh and not to be taken seriously. I found the book weird more than anything, and I finished it with a feeling of puzzlement. I couldn't understand why the author chose to write something so unusual and why he felt the need to propose such an outrageous spiritual conspiracy theory. But I have to respect this book at least a little bit for two main reasons: The writing and the general respect the author shows toward the reader. The writing is very good, without a comma out of place or a typo to be found. And I like the respect the author shows toward the reader. He doesn't go over the top in his writing by making extreme, insulting statements toward Lennon or anyone else. As a matter of fact, the author actually seems a little remorseful over the whole ordeal. He grew up liking the Beatles music, and he doesn't want to believe that John Lennon would have sold his soul to the devil, but he reluctantly comes to this conclusion and presents this book as evidence that the way he believes is really the truth.<br /><br />The Lennon Prophecy is a strange book about John Lennon and one that many will rate among the most ridiculous books they have ever read. The author is convinced that Lennon sold his soul to the devil and he feels he has evidence to back his claims. It's an odd book and its evidence is sketchy at best. While I consider it a below average book, I can see how fans of the Beatles and John Lennon in particular might find it worth a read, just to relive old memories and perhaps enjoy a laugh or two as they contemplate whether or not Lennon really sold his soul in exchange for Earthly fame.",Negative
"The Guaranteed Profit System is a book about succeeding in business and it was written by a man with more than thirty- five years' experience in business. Starting with the foundations of a successful business, the book walks the reader through some of the important steps to successful small business operation. With each piece of advice, the book explains a few things for clarity and includes a few questions and answers, as well as allowing some space to take personal notes. The advice is divided between retail businesses and service businesses. Sometimes, the necessary steps to success are slightly different for these different types of business so the book offers different sections of advice when appropriate.<br /><br />With this many years of experience under his belt, the author has achieved a certain degree of business success, so he obviously knows a thing or two about running a company. However, I have many problems with The Guaranteed Profit System- problems that prevent me from giving this book a recommendation. My number one problem will be obvious to anyone who reads this book: The poor writing. The book is loaded with bad grammar, misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, and sentence fragments. Not only that, but The Guaranteed Profit System is written using very short paragraphs on most every page- often single sentence paragraphs. Even when it is obvious that the same thought is continuing from one line to the next, the book still separates the common thought into short paragraphs. Missing question marks, typos, and other mistakes are commonplace, too. The excessive number of paragraphs makes the book read faster because there are so many blank lines. But the reading gets to be a chore after a while because the misspellings and other mistakes are so distracting.<br /><br />The Guaranteed Profit System makes frequent mention of its affiliated web site throughout the book and the web site does, indeed, offer free spreadsheet downloads and other services to help a business owner get going and make improvements. This is nice, but I would have preferred to see some graphic illustrations in the body of the book itself. Other than a simple table of numbers or some other brief illustration, there are very few visual aids to help explain the material. These illustrations are commonplace in other business books. It seems that The Guaranteed Profit System left them out in order to get readers to logon to the web site instead, to see some of the spreadsheets and other materials.<br /><br />The Guaranteed Profit System doesn't cover every aspect of small business growth and development (very few books do), but it does cover the basics. Starting with some small talk on the reasons why people get into business and ending with a plan that can be implemented to deal with employee issues, The Guaranteed Profit System covers some of the important aspects of running a company. This book does present some good ideas for running a successful business, but the poor writing greatly distracts from the enjoyment of the book and it makes it difficult to take it as seriously as I would like. In addition to that, I don't like the way the book ends. There is no index, glossary, after word, appendix, notes, sources, or anything else. It just comes to an abrupt halt on the book's final page.<br /><br />Overall, The Guaranteed Profit System is a book I cannot recommend due to its abysmal writing/lack of editing. It's a real shame, because I think the author has plenty of good advice to offer. A small investment to pay an editor to correct the mistakes and improve the writing style would have worked wonders. But taken as it stands, The Guaranteed Profit System is a poorly written guide that means well, but fails to persuade as well as it could. The writing is distracting to the point that you cannot concentrate on the text.",Negative
"The Squirrel, the Worm, and the Nut Trees is a sub-par children's book about a male squirrel who has to find a way to outsmart a worm in order to get the necessary sustenance his family needs for winter survival. The worm is causing the nuts to rot, leaving the squirrel without a means to feed his family. He has to think of something; some way to prevent the worm from destroying his food supply if he hopes to survive.<br /><br />This book is all about pre- planning and working toward a solution to a problem. This is fine and good, but there are many faults that prevent this from being a good children's book. Among the most noticeable of the issues I have with this book is the lack of good editing. Examples include statements like, I love to rotten the nuts with my silk webs, and, Mr. Squirrel and his family had to stretch the nuts they had found, so that they would last a longtime. Unless the dictionary has changed, the word rotten isn't a verb, a nut cannot be physically stretched, and longtime is two separate words, not one. Some simple editing would have cleared up this glaring problem. Another area that needs editing is the placement of quotes. There are many quotes from Mr. Squirrel and Mr. Worm and they are often right next to each other. You cannot immediately tell who is saying what until you finish the paragraph.<br /><br />Another issue I have with this book is the story itself. Aside from the idea that planning ahead is a good way to solve a problem, there is no real moral to the story. The story is also a little too simplistic. The squirrel needs to outsmart the worm, so what does he do? His brilliant plan is to gather the nuts earlier in the year. Considering this book is aimed at elementary school children between the ages of nine and twelve, this story is a little too basic. Something more unique or creative would have made the story much better.<br /><br />Is there anything redeeming about this book? I can think of exactly one thing: The illustrations. They look like they were taken directly from a television cartoon and they offer many cute drawings of the squirrels, worms, trees, and surrounding forest terrain. Most everything is either brown or green, so the illustrations are not particularly colorful. But they are realistic, and there is enough visual enjoyment that children will not pay much attention to the story.<br /><br />Overall, The Squirrel, the Worm, and the Nut Trees is a below- average children's book that lacks much originality, uses bad grammar, isn't always realistic (what type of worm makes a web?), and doesn't offer a very strong or complete message (the book ends with the worm unable to figure out what happened). Only the illustrations rescue this book from the lower ranks of children's fiction. It isn't much, but it will do in a pinch when the younger children have nothing else to do and want some fun pictures to view.",Negative
"Graydon Carter is the Editor in Chief of Vanity Fair magazine and he is an outspoken critic of the Bush administration and its many failed policies. He wrote this book as a way to reach out to the public with facts and other official information showing why Bush is unfit to hold the office of the presidency and how much we have lost since he took the oath of office in January, 2001.<br /><br />Carter spends most of his time in this book talking about specific parts of the failed Bush agenda and why they are wrong for America and the world. He begins with the military operatives in the Middle East because it is this military buildup and the reality of war that has shaped much of the president's policy- both foreign and domestic- and given the administration excuses for curtailing civil liberties, growing the size of government to record levels, and exponentially increasing the size of the federal budget deficit. What Carter talks about in these first couple of chapters is nothing new: The Bush administration created the Iraqi threat to have an excuse to invade; completely ignored the fact that the majority of the terrorists were Saudis; deliberately avoided publicly talking about Osama Bin Laden in order to shift the emphasis to Iraq; etc. These observations, and others like them, have been stated by many analysts, journalists, politicians, and other people, both expert and non- expert alike.<br /><br />With the remaining chapters, Carter illustrates what Americans have lost with specific chapters on key topics like the economy, education, the environment, and others. In these and other chapters, he relies on statistics and quotes to drive his points home. There is little in the way of actual commentary by Carter. He feels the facts and quotations of others are enough to convince readers that the American people have sacrificed many things under Bush and that four more years with him in office would only compound the problem.<br /><br />Some of what Carter says hits home, and many readers will have their own personal favorite topic or chapter. I like the facts about the explosion of red ink under Bush and the faltering economy and I think Carter's decision to include so many facts- along with anti Bush quotations from Republicans- does add credibility to his side. But there are several things about this book that take away from its potential as an informational source. First, I get really tired of Carter's persistent labeling of people. He goes on a tirade where he refers to people and policies with his ""Right- wing"" this, ""Right wing"" that, ""ultra- conservative"", and other rhetoric. Often, his labeling makes no sense and even contradicts itself. For example, there are places in the book where he attacks a Bush appointee as ""anti- government"" and then proceeds to explain how this appointee plans to use government to enforce his/her own social agenda- one that includes suppression of civil liberties and other rights. If someone is anti- government, they would most certainly not want to use government to further their own social agenda. These people are actually very pro- government. The only difference between them and other pro- government politicians is the way they want to use/abuse government power. Carter makes no attempt to explain this important difference.<br /><br />Another thing that Carter does throughout this book is look for studies and statistics to back his own point of view, completely ignoring studies that have reached opposite conclusions. I can't really blame Carter too much for this because all political books do it, at least to an extent. But some of his sources are pretty far- fetched, like one that he quotes in the book that says the Social Security system is on solid financial footing and will be for many decades to come. Carter probably had to search long and hard to find a study like that one. I have conducted my own research on the issue and my studies show the Social Security pyramid slowly collapsing (assuming the present tax rate and retirement age stay the same) in less then 20 years. Also, Carter relies on certain sources a little too frequently, like ""Mother Jones"" magazine. It shouldn't be too surprising that he would choose a publication like this one to quote (given its political stand on the issues) but a little more widespread distribution on sources would have made the book stronger and more appealing.<br /><br />In some other parts of the book, the author even gets a little bit insulting, like when he talks about the subject of affirmative action. The book speaks about this subject like it is an essential part of any economy and the author even has the gall to suggest that people like Condi Rice and Clarence Thomas would never have succeeded in any way without the aid of affirmative action! Carter might have intended his words on this subject to be interpreted differently, but the way I read it is that these two individuals don't have the intelligence to succeed on their own and that only government intervention can create opportunity for ""oppressed"" groups of people.<br /><br />Other things about this book that bug me are its lack of any humor and its structure. Many other political books like this one try to lighten up the reading with some occasional sarcasm and good- humored wit. But Carter does nothing of the kind, preferring instead to keep his book straight and narrow. He is serious about how he feels and he keeps the tone of the book on this level from start to finish. Then, there is the structure of the book. I don't like the insertion of stand- alone quotations with no text leading into the quotation. Quotes are good and they add value to any book but I don't think they are handled well in this book (they jump out of nowhere). I also don't like the fact that he includes no footnote section or index. He mentions his sources as he quotes the facts (most of the time, anyway). I would like it better if there was a section at the end of the book complete with sources. And in some instances, it almost seems like Carter is deliberately ""padding"" his book. For example, there is a section near the beginning that lists the individual names of all the people killed in the Iraqi conflict (at the time this book was written). A simple listing of the number killed from each country would have been good enough. There was no need to take up space with all these names.<br /><br />This is a difficult book to judge. On one hand, I admire the fact that Carter wants to let the world know just how damaging the Bush administration has been to America. But on the other hand, his writing leaves much to be desired and it doesn't really point out anything that others haven't already stated before (and stated better!) in other books and periodicals. For these reasons, I'm going to give ""What We've Lost"" a non- recommendation. It has some important things to say about a very important topic, but it doesn't go about it in the most convincing way and what it says has been stated thousands of times before.",Negative
"Anderson's book is 342 pages in length and it's a decent primer for those who know very little about the sons of the world's most famous princess. Anderson stays focused on the boys, for the duration of the book, talking about the relationship between William and Harry and the important people who influence them.<br /><br />There are some new tidbits of information in this book that I hadn't heard before, like the strained relationship between William and Harry, and Camilla Parker Bowles, the woman who was instrumental in the breakup of Prince Charles and the boy's mother. But other than this, there isn't a whole lot of new information to be found in this book. Most readers already know about the cold indifference on the part of the Queen and her husband, when Diana was killed; the incorrigible antics of the young Prince William; the boy's love of blondes; etc. For the most part, Anderson just rehashes old news.<br /><br />One other thing I didn't like about this book was the way Anderson wrote it, in ""snips"". Basically, Anderson just keeps pointing out little facts and quotes from the members of the royal family, jumping from one incident to another. When I read a book that's supposed to be a biography, I prefer something that digs in a little deeper into the lives of the people whom the book is written about. I don't care so much about hearing silly quotes made by prince Harry while fox hunting. I would rather hear more information about the boys thoughts, feelings, etc. to get a better feel for what makes William and Harry tick. I don't think Anderson did a good job in this area.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me is the fact that Anderson doesn't even bother to title his chapters. There are eight of them, but they are unnamed. Given the way the book is arranged, with so many ""snips"", I assume that Anderson had a difficult time deciding on titles for the chapters, so he just left them out completely. If Anderson had focused more on specific topics, he would have had no problem coming up with chapter titles.<br /><br />So, my bottom- line on this book is that it's not that great or that memorable. It might be interesting to those who like to read about the royal family. But for the rest of us, it's a mediocre work of non- fiction.",Negative
"""Feel like joining a conspiracy? If so, author Mark Smith has a deal for you: membership to the all- exclusive Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, or VRWC for short. Here, you will learn all the tricks of the trade that liberals use to press their agenda on the people. Membership is offered completely free of charge and all adults are welcome"".<br />Author Mark Smith is a trial lawyer and conservative commentator and activist who wrote this book as a way of arming conservatives with the necessary ammunition needed to confront and defeat liberal arguments on a wide array of subjects and political topics. Each chapter (there are 28 in all) is short with brief responses to some of the more common liberal concerns about the environment, education, the war in Iraq, the death penalty, health care, affirmative action, abortion, and other issues.<br />Smith's performance is strongest when he is talking about economic issues, school choice, and a few other subjects. The reason he makes more sense in these areas is because he has statistics and facts to back up his claims. But in other areas, like the death penalty, abortion, the war in Iraq, etc., Smith doesn't really provide anything substantive to back his ideas. His attitude is arrogant, and he seems like he wants you to just accept his premises for the arguments as fact without any evidence to justify his claims. He seems to be saying ""I'm right because I'm a conservative"". For example, in the chapter on abortion, Smith immediately states that a human fetus is a person with full rights at the moment of fertilization. He includes one quote from another anti- abortion individual and that's it. There is no in- depth discussion about the topic. He just starts with his own premise, says it's true, and then moves on to the next part of his argument. He follows the same formula in other chapters, too.<br />One important point to remember is that what Smith describes in this book is actually his own brand of conservative. At no point does he suggest that Republicans adhere to every facet of the political idealism that he believes in. It's obvious, though, that he supports Republicans as the ""lesser of two evils"". But it's also obvious that he realizes the Republican party doesn't really practice what it preaches when it comes to fighting for ""small"" government. Republican administrations have expanded government at an even faster pace then their Democratic counterparts, and there is substantial proof to back this up. And even Mark Smith isn't necessarily against big government. He gives the reader the illusion in this book that he wants government to be limited, but then he babbles on and on about increasing the military budget, expanding the death penalty, and effectively launching a war against abortions. All of these measures involve large expansions in government spending and government power.<br />The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy Handbook has too many chapters and attempts to cover too many topics to be completely effective. Each chapter contains about 5 to 10 pages. There is no possible way to have an intellectual and thorough discussion of topics like abortion, health care, the death penalty, and other hot issues in such a small amount of space. In addition, the questions that are answered are far too basic. Smith avoids the really tough questions and sticks instead with those that are direct and simple to refute.<br />Overall, this book is inadequate as a tool to use against liberal arguments. It's far too simplistic and many of its arguments (like those dealing with the war in Iraq, Bush's electoral win over Gore, abortion, etc.) are weak and incomplete. I seriously doubt that a book like this will succeed in converting liberals over to conservative political ideology. It's ineffective, at best.",Negative
"Peter Bowler presents a synopsis of Charles Darwin's contributions to science, history, and culture. This book tries to provide a quick summary of the important periods in Darwin's life, touching briefly on each significant aspect.<br /> Much of the book is written in a somewhat technical way and is a bit too wordy. I had a difficult time maintaining my interest while I was reading some of the chapters. Certain areas deserved more coverage, like the reaction when Darwin went public with his theories.<br /> On the positive side, this book does give some good insight on Darwin's relationships with the other prominent scientists of his time and there are some moments where the slowness of the book becomes more interesting, like the section that covers Darwin's voyage of discovery aboard the Beagle. Overall, however, Bowler does not really present anything new or profound that we haven't heard before.",Negative

"These dolls were not much more than voodoo dolls. you basically trace an outline sew done. If I am going to pay for a book and patterns I expect them to be a little more in depth. I would say a third grader can make these dolls, but by the end of third grade you can expect the kid to do better work.",Negative
"It dose not tell you what I wanted to know, how to generate extra income using green tatics around your home.

"Change the name Laura To Disney, Grand canyon or where ever it is you have been and you would have at least the same story if not a better one. It is just a boring vacation in a costume. She could have learned more from a historical reenachtement group specializing in that era and would have met a better boyfriend along the way. The author didn't find herself just a bunch of life stuff happened like it does to us all.",Negative
"This was slow and boaring. I did not find it helpful for someone like my self who is trying to reconcile a Christian back ground, but has talents like cartomancy that falls more in a magical life style.",Negative
This book didn't really get into silver elf philosiphy and I really didn't get into it. There are much better tarot ritual books out there. You can skip this one.,Negative
I didn't finish this book it was really boaring. It is mostly a list of the suplies and skills the charecters have. Everyone is one is wooden and dull. I could go on but other reviws say basicaly the same things so I am writeing the review to contribute to the over all star rateing.,Negative
"I got this book thinking there would be a few thing inaccurate like potatos from the new world or black pepper. There is a curry recipe for the elves of lothlorian. Elves eating curry WTF! Also there are a lot of recipes that add sugar to what should be a savory dish, now my cabbage is too sweet for a side dish but too much of a vegtable for desert and it's just really yucky.",Negative
I had to read this in seventh grade. The book didn't grip my attention at all. Everything was predictable. About half way through I no longer cared who stole Kathy young. The way she was kidnaped made her a stupid person in my mind. She wasn't watching where she was walking and she let a stranger get too close. Pay attention to your souroundings and if someone gets too close be rude to them and run like hell.,Negative
This book was part of our survival unit in seventh grade. I was bored and anoyed the entire time. There was a lot of sitting in the crashed car and siting fallowed by more sitting. I hope today they give the kids something good like when all hell breaks loose by Cody lundine or something that may actually help in a survival situation.,Negative
"I had scoliosis and the teacher made me read this book to ""help"" me. Instead it scared the crap out of me. My scoliosis was minor and didn't need anything I just lean to the side a little. This book had me in fear of surgry and ugly braces tha would get me teased worse than I was. The second problem was there were several refrences to ""touching the special place"". I read this book in sixth grade and was not ready to deal with that stuff. I would say the book is beter for tenth grade on that issue.",Negative
"I had to read this in seventh grade as part of our growing up unit. I didn't get the point of the book or why the teacher made me read this book when other kids were reading other books. any how The story was about a fat boy with no self confadance. Basically he didn't get any untill he started to lose weight. His best friend got a nose job and got confidance. so I guess the moral of the story is looks are important. There was a scene in the book that hinted at masturbation that went right over my head at the time, but as an adult I find not aceptable for the age group that is actually reading it. Better suited to kids about three years older.",Negative
"This book was full of violence and sex. I don't normally mind, but the ""heroin"" of the story wasn't very heroic. If this darkness led to a path of redemption then It would not bother me. They were enslaveing kids, they drownded a horse in a bar, nobody was nobel enough to care! Not one charecter stood up and said enough is enough. Nobody decided to fight or say no. It was as if this was ok. It would be if there was fighting and a plan to over throw the system.",Negative
This guy is #uc!^g nuts! Ok here is the problem some lazy parents use tv as a babysitter. If you let your children watch a show and don't talk about it with them then what they do is your fault not the shows. That being said how do you have a plot with no conflict? You can't have the rangers in vite the monsters over for tea and cookies that would be really boaring. Implied sexual inuendo? I haven't seen that when I watched. Tommy and kimberly were dateing and that was about it.,Negative

"I stopped reading this authors books several years ago due to the high amount of editing errors.  The actual stories are usually good but she puts out books fast with little regard for editing.  For .99 i took a chance; this one was no diff, misspelled words, wrong words used in sentence, doesn’t know the difference between a baker and a bakery. DNF. A waste of .99",Negative
"First time reading this author and this series.  I found it very choppy and hard to follow,  had to backup several times and re read the pages because things would jump and i lost track of what was going on.  Several editing errors didnt help,  not sure if i will read more.  So what happened to the lawyer of the ex husb?",Negative
"The whole premise was interesting and grabbed my attention, but so disappointing.  The book has so much of a lead in, shallow personalities of the characters and the entire story is slow and dry.  This book would do well with a Christian label - alot of insinuations and making out but its all G rated.  I don't need heavy sex in a book but this book had so much of the making out, you could skip half the book and not lose the story.  I won't be reading the rest of it.  Thankfully its a KU so nothing lost but a couple hours of my time.",Negative

"The plot was limited and not much of interest  except will she, won't she, stuff. Romance is fine but not<br />when the entire plot hinges on it. Very disappointed. So wanted to believe the other reviewers.",Negative
"I very seldom warn people not to read a book. This is a rare exception. Along with the drawbacks other reviewers have mentioned add the violence...a lynching, bludgeoning, rape, two slit throats, head shot, and one death so horrifying I wish I could erase it from my brain...these can only please a sadist.<br /><br />The gruesome description of these acts does nothing to add to the plot or background. My conclusion is that the author was aware of the weakness in the writing and wanted to prop it up with horror. Yucko, what a waste of paper and time. I wish there was a minus star to give this ""book"".",Negative
"Bore of a book. The author clearly doesnt understand male dominance over the word ""femininity"" and over american capitalism itself. Its sad. Waste of time&money",Negative
"Kings books used to be great. This book sucked. Not only is his take on current society forced and painfully prosed, his depiction of one character's club foot is innaccurate. As someone with a club foot, i was offended that King made it sound like something to be ashamed of. Glad i didnt buy(rented--library) this ultra short mess of a read.",Negative
I simply cannot take seriously any advise coming from someone who calls himself an expert and says that there is no reason to not consume aspartame.  Cancer would be one.  Check the peer reviewed scientific studies.  Book was returned.,Negative
"This hurts.  I've admired Dr. Longo's ingenuity, creativity and genius for a while now.  Loved one of his documentaries on FireStick...watched podcasts and interviews.  Loved each and every single one of them.<br /><br />Then I bought this book.  It all fell appart for me.  I'd have returned it if it wasn't because I had earmarked a few pages.<br /><br />First few parts of the book are mostly autobiographical.  Call me crazy but I was not that interested in that portion of the book.  I mean, he's lead a very rich life, I just don't want to pay to hear about it.  Tell me all about it over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, for free.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a huge sale on his Prolon FMD product.  Which is fine.  I'd would have loved to know what I was getting myself into before actually paying to buy advertising.<br /><br />IF, and that is a big IF, you are not familiar at all with fasting and its benefits it will serve you better to watch his documentary.  Also, there is another great documentary about fasting, etc. called The Science of Fasting.  Both are great.<br /><br />IF you are unable to fast for health or weight loss due to health issues or social issues or whatever, then sure, you can pay to get the FMD Prolon info from his book ...or...you could get it for free on his website.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone not waste their hard earned pesos.",Negative
"I thought by the description that I'd find lots of botanical info...no such a thing...this is mostly a memoir and I love memoirs, this one, however, did not grab me at all.  Just did not find it interesting...would have returned the book if it was not because I forgot I had it...donated to Goodwill instead.",Negative
I am sorry to give a bad review (I actually wanted to return the book on the spot but I forgot and now I feel bad about doing it this late)...IF you never have time to look up recipes online (or if you just prefer printed stuff) then this book would be great for you...if you are friendly with cooking sites online this is a waste of your money...there is not one recipe here that I have not seen on different online sites for free.,Negative
didn't like,Negative
"If I knew then what I know now about the book, I wouldn't have gotten it. Boring, slow, one-dimensional characters created a story where you kept reading in anticipation for something to happen until the last page...when nothing happened. Keep in mind that this book was based off of a true story so the author probably tried to keep to the true (and obviously rather monotonous) facts as much as possible. I was hoping to learn more about these particular Indians and what being a captive meant, but I only got a small glance of it in between the main characters' religious rebukes and prayers.",Negative
"I now see why I was able to buy this book for $1...while the analogies were often unique and entertaining they couldn't save this book from being a waste of time. The premise was boring and passive aggressive to say the least. Unless you have an obsession with old low budget science fiction films and depressed narratives that make you want to wash your hands after, it's better to just skip reading this book.",Negative
"I was very disappointed in this book. Prior to Hurricane Harvey, my yard in Houston had been planted carefully and bloomed all year long ( well, 11 months) based on our climate.  Most all the plants and our grass died in the heavy flood, which has taken us 4 years to finally get to the yard. I was thrilled to find a book with Year Round Bloomers, expecting it to make my job easier. However....inside the book cover, there are no good pictures like the hard-cover outside. You have no idea what the plants he discusses look like unless you go to the computer. I also wish he had categorized bloomers by regional zones, so you knew if it grew and bloomed in your zone. Instead, it feels like they were just trying to get out another book to sell with his known name...without care for customer needs or expectations.",Negative
Highly disappointed that it said it would be the illustrated version and it was not. I will have to find and purchase elsewhere and donate this to a local library.,Negative
"I personally did not care for the book, It wasn't what I expected, have read better bios.I wouldn't recommend it.",Negative
The pages are too dark to use for writing on.,Negative
This book was written for a High School reader. No character development  & boring storyline! I recommend this book to Junior High Readers!!,Negative
"I have read many books in this genre and have never read one as boring and slow as this. The book never gets to the point (which is?). There is no story to the book, just rambling continuation of the same thing. Also there is hardly a climax and end to the story. If the movie is anything like this, it must be a bomb too!!",Negative
Super dated photos!!,Negative
"All in all, this coloring book is okay. I wouldn't purchase another by this publisher again due to how thin the paper is and the blank border around the doodle images. There are much better books for close to the same price. The book has 17 pictures plus two &#34;bonus&#34; pictures from other editions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Interesting doodle pictures - I attached some examples<br />- Fun patterns that will be nice to color<br />- Pictures are single sided to help with bleed through<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Paper is crazy thin! Even though the pictures are single sided, using my markers it bled through to the next image (see attached). You definitely have to remove the page from the book if you are using markers.<br />- Another con, the pages aren't perforated - so removing them from the book cleanly will require some scissors, luck, or a xacto knife.  Not a big deal, but quite annoying.<br />- The pictures don't take up the whole page, there is a lot of border around even the &#34;full page&#34; images. I prefer the pages to reach all the way to the end.  It will be hard to get clean borders on the square images.",Negative
"I found this book painful to read. Several times I thought about giving it up. If you are considering this book, I would read the first chapter before purchasing to see if the style is to your liking.",Negative
Boring.,Negative
"I was really so ready to love this book after reading a WONDERFUL article in the Sunday Chicago Tribune.  I thought it sounded scholarly yet very anecdotal in the best sense.  I got instead a lot of self absorbed reminiscing.  I admit I gave up after the fifth stoner story about driving around in Hyde Park and  South Shore.  Stoned and listening to ""Baker Street""?  Really...?  P.S. There is more than one church besides Neri in South Shore!  And what's with the snobbery about hating WFMT?<br />...",Negative
envelope that book arrived in was damaged looked like it had been run over and oil leaked on it also book looked used when I opened package ( I paid almost $100.00 including shipping/Handling for a new book) book looked as though it had been used...maybe because it HAD BEEN RAN OVER????<br /><br />Update: I didn't want people to think I was blaming the seller....... I would like to say that I didn't think that the seller mailed the book like that I think the Post-Office must of unintentionally dropped the envelope and it went under the truck and ran over the package and that may have damaged the book... the book was for someone else and he said to just forget about it..he could still read it.,Negative

"It took me a while to finish this book, it was a combination of life getting in the way and this book seriously needing an editor and the author incessantly bringing up her faith with a capital G God at least once per chapter. Not being a Christian I found that somewhat annoying.<br />The editing errors were bad, in one scene the protagonist, Clarice, doffed (dear author, that means to take off) her shoes in the house, ran to the beach and then takes off the shoes she wasn't wearing. I reported close to a dozen content errors in this book. It starts off and keep looping back to being a supernatural thriller with ghosts possessing 'powers' but then segues into past life regression therapy and a generic as not to offend version of what appears to be heaven where (hello editor?) she's told if she drinks from the fountain she'll never be thirsty again, she drinks. Later in the book she's thirsty, hello? There's a bit on lucid dreaming but it's only relevant for a chapter or two and then it's never part of the story again.<br />The story meanders and wanders, there's some moments that are fairly scary but then the story wanders off like a five year old. I was disgusted with the ending, bits and pieces of the story lead up and lead up to the final confrontation (and if you paid attention you knew the final reveal long before the author got around to it.) and then, *poof* the story ends. The spooky bits are over. Past life regression and lucid dreaming are abandoned on the side of the road. I expected much more from the final confrontation than I got. I read the book and didn't give up but that's all I can say about the book. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Edit 1-15-18: I guess the book isn't the only thing in need of editing; I completely blocked a part of the story line that I truly hated, the worst trope an author can use is 'book within a book'. I don't mind a flash of insight from someone else's 'book' even a page if it advances the story but being subjected to the character in the book reading a book or in this case a journal that stretches on page after page I get annoyed. It feels like filler. A lesson in how to stretch a novella or even short story into a novel.",Negative
"I know it's my fault but the size of this coloring book should not be hidden down in the 'product dimensions' section of the Product Details are, eight lines down. So utterly disappointed and disgusted getting a 5&#34; x 8&#34; coloring book when every other coloring book I've bought have been full size 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; coloring books. These pictures are small, cramped and hard to color. The size should have been openly disclosed in the main product information. I blame myself but also the publisher. Even worse? This and the other two surprisingly small coloring books were chosen from the back of [[ASIN:1574219952 Good Vibes Coloring Book (Coloring Is Fun)]] which is a full size coloring book but even worse a good third of the content of  this 'Color Cool' book are IN the Good Vibes coloring book. We bought them full size and now we have them in miniature. What a waste of money. We get to color the same pictures twice, joy. I'll be far more careful in picking products from this or any other product. This was another terribly disappointing experience.",Negative

"This is pathetic. An insult to any adult not drooling into a bib in a retirement facility. All you're doing is going around the outside circumference of the picture. There's NO mystery whatsoever to what any of the images are. Worse, halfway through the book there's a page that says 'solutions' and EVERY image is repeated with a picture of the image solved and you have to re-do the 'puzzle' all over again. There's no challenge, no complexity. It's not even fun in any way. Give this to a four or five year old, I bet they're bored in an hour. Tis is quite possibly the worst 'adult' dot-to-dot books.<br />Please don't buy this.",Negative
"One of the worst books I've ever read. I'm reading book three to see if it could possibly get worse.<br /><br />70+ years after the first Rama artifact/ship visited our solar system the planet's economy has collapsed, there's been wars, famine, quite a horrible time. The world is slowly recovering when the next Rama object is spotted. They plan for a rendezvous inside the orbit of Venus Why wait so long? Why not outside Mars or further for a longer exploration time?<br />Now I understand the world has had troubles but I cannot (I live in Florida 50 miles from Cape Canaveral) for the life of me understand how this crew was chose and assembled. Egomaniacal reporters willing to sacrifice others in the crew to get their story. They were also somehow allowed to bring practically a pharmacy's worth of drugs along with no questions asked. Fixated egotistical scientists who aren't open to new ideas (so why explore?). Religiously fanatic military commanders. Other high ranking officers with jelly for spines who allow the reporters and borderline insane scientists to take command of the mission. Recklessly dangerously activity.<br />Then there's the flashbacks, one character in particular spends chapter after chapter reliving massive and unnecessary portions of her life. She falls in a hole, it should take a page or three to describe her recovery and escape instead it takes several chapters of going back into her childhood and adolescences. It was incredibly boring. It dragged on endlessly slowly. The characters do things that make no sense (baptism? seriously?) I only finished in the hopes that Rama would win and just finish not only the people on board but the Earth herself I so despised every single person in this book.<br />The first book wasn't a swashbuckling space opera and the character development was a little flat but THEY acted like a proper crew aboard a spacecraft. It was a tale of exploration and wonder. This book was Laurel & Hardy and The Three Stooges go Spacey. Horrible, Just horrible.<br />They must have waved quite a check under Clarke's nose to get him to all Lee to do. . . this, to his creation. I was floored and have little hope for the rest of the 'series'.",Negative
"Another, albeit my last, terrible book out of India. There's nothing new in here. All the stories in this book have been around forever. They've just been poorly rewritten. Old tales such as 'The Giving Tree' and the story of the ant and grasshopper are aped by this author along with what looks like images found with a Google image search. Some are photos others cartoons there's no consistency. Yes, morals are a good thing to instil in our children just not with this book.<br /><br />This book was free on Amazon when the author emailed me and asked me to obtain and review a copy.",Negative
"Apologies to the author I tried for nearly two weeks and I just couldn't get into the story. Nothing grabbed me and made me want to find out more. I was told that even though this is part of a series it was readable as a stand-alone novel. Not knowing the back story though truly did hinder my understanding of who the characters were, why they acted the way they did, etc. The story jumped, repeatedly in the portion I was able to read, between a fantasy realm and a modern Earth setting and threw a lot of characters from previous story lines.<br />Some of the characters felt like cookie cutter fantasy novel characters. The humble and understanding hero type. The good guy who's gone angsty and is going to get the rest of the good guys. The older, wiser mentor of the good party. It's all been done to death.<br />I honestly found nothing here to recommend. Maybe if I'd read the previous books? But I was told this would work as a stand alone and it just didn't.<br />I received this book in exchange for my review.",Negative
"They say you can't judge a book by its cover but I've always thought you could to some degree. Publishers would only hire the great cover artists for their books they thought would be immense successes. 2nd string artists got the rest of the work on book they were taking a chance on. The cover of this book looks like it was done in ten or fifteen minutes in Microsoft's Paint. I should have stopped there and declined the book but I made myself finish both of the stories this contained.<br /><br />The book reads like it was written in a language other than English and then translated over. If this is the case then it's one of the better translations that I've come across but the dialog, phrasing and writing is still strange to my English raised ears. Dialog like; &#34;Tell your parents I am coming for a visit. I will see you all after three days.&#34; just don't sound right and they jarred me completely out of the narrative when I came across them which was sadly all too often.<br /><br />The first and longest story is a retelling, modern day take on the Cinderella tale. While I can suspend belief for a lot of things the main plot, actions of the characters and yes, the dialog, were just too much. If you're held captive in an inescapable house but can see people walking by why don't you break a window and scream for help? If you've been told your husband or wife died while you were sick wouldn't one of the first things you'd do on recovery be visiting their grave to pay your respects? So many things should have ended this story before it actually happened. It's just too unbelievable which added to the bad dialog made for a book I could not enjoy.<br /><br />The 2nd story should put parents in a panic to reinforce their don't talk to strangers and never go off on the motorcycle of some strange adult you met ten minutes earlier. Seriously? This story read like a mediocre grammar school writing project. C-, Needs Work.<br /><br />The author alerted me by email that the book was to be free for a short time and asked for a review.",Negative
"The pictures are amazing. The calendar is almost completely useless as a calendar if you need to keep track of important days, appointments, etc. The names of the months aren't even printed on the pages they're just numbered 1 through 12. Very little space is provided to jot down any notes. I'm very sorry I bought and gifted this. A calendar should be useful as well as pretty. This fails terribly on the usefulness part.",Negative
"Normally a book this length takes me a couple days to read. I struggled with this book, picking it up, getting bored, annoyed or disgusted and then putting it down and walking away repeatedly for over a full week.<br />I couldn't find one character in this tale that I cared even the slightest about. They're all fairly well messed up, self absorbed, neurotic or otherwise damaged. Even the kids are annoying especially the one who wrote an entire (overly long!) chapter in a Power Point slide show which mostly discussed her brother's obsession with and the cataloging of rests/pauses in songs. While these people felt real, I've met several neurotics who matched quite well the quirks of the people in this book I just couldn't care about them.<br />Worst of all and one of my major pet peeves the narrative jumps around not only in time (we often have NO idea where in time we are during the story) it also jumps narrative styles. We go from an objective narrator to first person and in one chapter the story is being told TO the reader as if they're one of the characters in the book. I found it disjointed, convoluted, frustrating and very annoying.",Negative
"I found this book to be nearly unbelievable. One of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish reading. The dialog and actions of the people involved from beginning to end sound more like cullings from bad movie-of-the-week scripts than anything that ever actually happened.<br /><br />The writing is stilted and forced. The editing also leaves much to be desired. As an example; During his last stint in rehab Todd claims to have been restrained, in a diaper, for three days due to his actions and behavior. On the very next page we're told he was in restraints for four days.<br /><br />Yes, we know that Todd has had multiple arrests and run-ins with law enforcement but much of the undocumented occurrences feel totally made up. Do I believe he experienced racism and even some jealousy at the hands of the police? Yes. Do I believe the LAPD was passing around 'Get that Todd Bridges guy no matter what!' memos, frequently hovering their helicopters over his house to annoy him or ""lost"" him for months in solitary confinement (immediately after he mentions he was marked as a high profile detainee and supposed to receive special treatment). Sorry, it just doesn't ring true to me.<br /><br />I didn't get any feeling of regret or remorse from this book. Much of it just felt like bragging about the people that liked/loved him and name dropping. Todd mentions that he's upset that other stars who have had serious public run-ins with alcohol and drug abuse had an easier time of returning to the spotlight and public eye. He blames this on racism failing to conceptualize that while 'those other' stars had drug problems he was a drug dealer running crack houses and exploiting women he deliberately got hooked on drugs so he could control them. There's a difference and I don't think it had anything to do with race.<br /><br />I'm glad he appears to have turned his life around but I just can't recommend this book.",Negative
"Elyssa East's favorite artist produced a series of paintings based on the abandoned Dogtown wilderness near Gloucester, MA. Trying to find some spiritual growth she visited the area, heard some of the typical small town New England gossip that surrounds any area that's been inhabited for hundreds of years and decided to write a book about the place.<br /><br />It feels like she started out to write a biography of the artist, Marsden Hartley, found that wouldn't make more than a short story then decided to add in the tale of a recent (1980's) murder that took place inside of the Dogtown wilderness when THAT turned out to not be enough to flesh out a book the author then dug up every and any bit of trivia, folklore, rumor and anecdote she could find no matter how distantly related to the main subject, Dogtown. As an example when a somewhat famous poet is mentioned as having spent time in the area we're also treated to the details of a school he taught at, every famous person who also taught at the school even if they had nothing to do with Dogtown. The story meanders; wandering from the past to the present while infrequently touching back on the 1980's murder story.<br /><br />There's far too much padding added to the book. I struggled for far longer than necessary for a book of this length. In the end the I found it hard to follow and just wanted it to end. I'm sure there are better histories of the Gloucester area out there and while they may not touch on or even mention Dogtown that's probably because in the grand scheme of things very little of real interest ever did happened there in it's hundreds of years of existence.",Negative

"There's a lot I could say about this book, but I think 'tried too hard' sums it up quite nicely. Tried too hard to be clever, tried too hard to be suspenseful, tried too hard to pull on the heartstrings, and all in the wrong ways possible. I should have closed the book after the first few pages. The big red flag for me was actually the part you read in the sample. Just take a moment and reflect on what you, as a normal human person, would so if some little kid came up to your door and handed you a letter from your SO. You'd read it, right? Just take it from them, open it, and give it a read. Even if you had some weird niggling feeling in the back of your brain that you're not going to like what's on it, you'd just read it. But no. Let's take how many pages for her to reflect on this letter, the absurdity of a little kid delivering it to your job, and what that all might mean. WHO DOES THAT? And she approaches everything with the same degree of laborious reflection. It's exhausting. Who lives their life like that? Plus, throw in the fact that you, and older, more sophisticated adult, understand little about technology. Come on. My 82 year old mother knows the difference between a pager and a cell phone. Just... ugh. Exhausting. Not even fun exhausting. Just exhausting.",Negative

"I listened to every word of this doleful, vulgar, seamy book while driving across the country. I knew it was an adult book and not intended for children but it is as though Ms Rowling set out to prove that in spite of her previous wonderful books she can write one that is as depressed and depressing as she is.  The book is a bloodbath of death, dark events, the foulest of language (how can a WOMAN so casually and frequently use a nasty word that denigrates all women???). There is not one happy person or one happy event in it and it rapidly sucks all the joy out of the reader. Most of the characters die, including an innocent child. It is not just gritty, but grimy. All the characters hate one another, cheat on one another, kill or want to kill one another, and there is no humor or lightness of tone anywhere in it.  I'm glad I only rented the CD set and didn't give her very much of my money for producing this kind of writing.  I knew it was an adult book but I wasn't prepared for it to be an expression of Ms. Rowling's ongoing clinical depression.  Good literature raises one up and inspires one to greatness; it doesn't drag one down into mud and guts and misery like this book.  Skip it altogether until she writes a decent one, and read one of the pieces of great literature that explore the development of GOOD character and have exciting, rewarding plots, like ""Shane"" or ""Rebecca"". Neither of these have happy endings, but they are well written, well plotted, and well developed. I'm not a prude and I'm not hung up on political correctness, but how can we condemn Paul Dean for using the N-word decades ago and not condemn  J K Rowling for currently using - PUBLISHING, even - the C-word repeatedly in this horrible, awful, depressing, joyless book???<br />This book is lacking decency in any form.  There's a reason the classics are the classics.  Read one of them instead and save your money, your time, and your mood.",Negative
"I have had a lot of textbooks over the past few years, psych and otherwise, and I am currently using this one for a PSYC 482 class. The content is decent and thought provoking, although many of the flashy graphics (charts, etc) are essentially useless and often so over over-simplified as to be just a waste of space. One gets the feeling they may have been added specifically for that reason, actually. In many cases the graphics and charts do not provide meaningful information. An example is the 'Breakdowns in the Family: Solutions' chart on page 50. Whomever created this chart put zero thought into the relevance/usefulness of the information in it. The solutions it presents are not only not related to anything in the text, but they are largely unworkable nonsense as one cannot travel through time to change things that occurred during childhood. An example from the chart on page 50 follows:<br /><br /> Problem: Father finds it hard to talk about the daughter's problems. Daughter is uncomfortable opening up to him.<br /> Solution: The father should make an effort to build trust by talking to the daughter while she is young.<br /><br />How is this a workable solution for a problem when the client is no longer a young child? What if they are an angry teenager? Not only is this ""solution"" impossible to implement, this extremely general statement is unhelpful and serves to merely frustrate the reader. Did you learn anything from it? Neither did I. Similar solutions are present throughout the graphic. Waste of space in the textbook--and it is not the only one.<br /><br />The format itself, that of a large magazine (about 1/3"" thick), is annoying, floppy, hard to read, and feels like nothing more than a way of making a textbook cheaper to produce while still charging an arm and a leg for it. Designed to mimic a magazine, this ""textbook"" is indeed quite floppy and requires two hands to hold if it is not laying on a flat surface, just like a real magazine (which would cost about $5). At least a paperback textbook can hold itself semi-upright in your lap while one is sitting in a recliner if held with only one hand (a hardcover can obviously accomplish this feat--my preferred format for texts), but this is not possible with this flimsy text. If you want to take a sip of your coffee, for example, you have to find a place to actually put the book down. IMHO, the decision to use this format was not a brilliant way of making it more readable; it was a way to shave costs off the production of the book while still charging inflated textbook prices.<br /><br />In fact, this text is much harder to read than other texts, as the content lacks the flow of a normal text. Topics are broken up into little 2-3 paragraph snippets with completely different fonts and formatting (even different colors), and are arranged in oddly-shaped text blocks to make the book feel more like a magazine. This serves no worthwhile purpose whatsoever, and makes it hard to absorb information. There is no ""flow"" to the content, and it just feels very choppy. The gimmick of looking like a magazine wore off in the first chapter and frustration quickly set in. I cannot wait to be done with this text. [Note: I spent a number of years involved in desktop publishing and working as a technical writer. The rules of document formatting have all been broken here, with the predictable result: different fonts, point sizes, colors and text block shapes on a single page/facing page make this design both unappealing and confusing to the eye. Hinders effective communication and makes it hard to stay engaged in the process of reading. Feels like the authors seem to have forgotten the point of a textbook is to actually read it, not to see how much it is possible to make it not look like a textbook. If it walks like a duck... And conversely, if it does not walk like a duck, it might not be a duck.]<br /><br />The content itself, despite the annoying formatting, is mostly pretty good, although there is a lot of unnecessary redundancy. I do not need to read the same thing two or three times. That said, the anecdotes and cultural references, often using movies we may (or may not) have seen as launching points, are a unique and effective way of presenting information in a manner that helps the reader relate. Unfortunately, this is the only saving grace of this book.<br /><br />Unlike with normal textbooks, I cannot seem to remember in which chapter I have read something. This is due to the very broken-up format of the content. This book simply has no ""flow"". One cannot stay engaged reading it for long periods of time. I am unlikely to use it again in the future, either in class, or as a reference. Which is probably a good thing, as the cheap, flimsy cover and paper would not stand up to repeated trips to and from the bookshelf (think magazine here folks). In fact, after only a month or so going in and out in my messenger bag, the cover is curling and bent.<br /><br />Conclusion: I cannot recommend this text. The formatting completely kills it. It feels gimmicky and like I paid way too much for it (always the case with textbooks, but at least with other textbooks, there is the expectancy of a reasonable shelf-life). I might give it one additional star if it were a hardcover instead of this cheap, frustrating softcover, but even then, it would only be mediocre overall, as it is very hard to read. (Note: I would have bought the Kindle edition, but it will apparently not work on normal Kindles, which seems to be a common trend in textbooks for Kindles, and is most frustrating. I would gladly do away with the horrid formatting for plain text so I could actually read it and get to the relevant content without the distracting formatting.)",Negative

"There are a few good sections in this book (mainly the chapters that deal with WebLogic and the appendices of primers and reference material that comprise Section 6).  However, considering that this book weighs in at over 1000 pages, its mainly fluff or glib (but not helpful), with too much material that states the obvious.<br />Much of the fluff is found in Section 1 (The E-Commerce Landscape), and Section 2 (Architecting Java-Based E-Commerce Systems) was, in my opinion, a glossed over, high-level overview that was used as filler.<br />Sections 3 (B2C E-Commerce Solutions) and 4 (B2B E-Commerce Solutions) have a few interesting chapters in each.  My main complaint here is that Section 3 is a mix of solutions and techniques, while Section 4 is purely solution-focused.  Section 5 (M-Commerce) is too light to be useful, and most of the material is already woefully out of date.<br />My recommendation is to pass this book up and, instead, seek out single-topic books that address the subjects in which you're interested.",Negative
"I loathe giving a bad review of a book by an author whose prior works are [in my opinion] classics that have greatly influenced my thinking and professional growth.  However,this book is a disappointment.<br />The &quot;blueprints&quot; given in this book are not as coherent nor are they described with the same sparkling prose for which Mr. Boar is known. I found his descriptions muddled, and his presentations redundant because the same diagrams are used over and over, which I personally found to be irritating.<br />Also, there are no fresh ideas in the approach - the blueprints are clearly based on the Zachman Framework.  Since I am a strong proponent of this framework and approach to IT architecture I agree with the ideas and concepts behind the book.  There are better, more articulate descriptions of the Zachman Framework in Enterprise Architucture Planning by Spewak and Hill, and Data Stores, Data Warehousing, and the Zachman Framework by Inmon, Zachman and Geiger.<br />My disappointment with this book may be because of one or more of the following reasons:  Mr. Boar was pressured by the publisher to produce another book and this is the result, or [possibly] because he has wandered into areas where he is somewhat out of his element.  The world of IT strategy, in which he is an acknowledged expert and fresh thinker, is not the same world as architecture.  His wonderful analogies using the works of Sun Tzu and Niccolo Machiavelli to reinforce his approach to strategy in his prior books do not play well in the architecture domain, which is the focus of this book.<br />My recommendation is to sidestep this book if you are interested in IT architecture and consider, instead, one or both of the ones I recommended above.  On the other hand, if you have an interest in IT strategy or aligning IT to business, any of Mr. Boar's books on strategic planning or IT alignment are insightful and important reading.",Negative
"The description of the book has more meat than the book itself.  This disappointing book is a 15 short chapter breeze through a multitude of subjects, and does not linger long on any single subject.  There are some  nice diagrams and ten thousand foot views crammed into 374 total pages (the  page count vs. chapter count alone should indicate how superficial this  book is).  An example is the 21 pages devoted to weighty subjects  encompassing project management tasks, configuration management,  verification and validation, quality assurance, decisions and risks. Any  one of the topics would have merited at least 20 page in a serious book on  systems engineering. Useful to sales and marketing types who are selling  systems engineering services, and executive management who might like a  quick overview of systems engineering.  This book is useless for technical  professionals.",Negative

It's a rant from start to finish, and with nothing to even remotely back up the arguments, it's more like a bad mood than a good book.",Negative
"This story was amazing in so many bad ways.  The main character is portaled/isekai'd into this new world which appears to be some kind of Japanese dating sim/school life computer game.  But he not only isn't the clear protagonist, but he remembers enough about this kind of game to try to fight being forced to act the way the game world expects.<br /><br />And that was so clearly wrong.  I couldn't get into this story.  The main character has a strange amnesia so he doesn't remember who he is, and obviously doesn't know anyone else he runs into.  Yet, this same young man is a stubborn jerk to everyone around him and barely tries to figure out what's going on before blindly lashing out against the invisible forces trying to move him within the world.<br /><br />I'm guessing its supposed to make the reader think he's heroic and strong, but to me it was more feeling like the author was passive-aggressive against having a real solid plot from the start.<br /><br />I know many people found this to be an excellent book, but there was so little character in the characters that I just couldn't find any reason to turn pages most of the time.  This was not a story I really felt worth reading.",Negative
"The idea here was one I had a ton of hope for.  There is a reason that games like Stardew Valley and Rune Factory work, and that is that people love the idea of helping rebuild a small community through farming and adventure.  And so the idea that a young man winds up falling through a portal and taking over a small farm on a rock floating in the sky seemed like a tale with tons of potential.<br /><br />Sadly, the three female characters here all were the type that I hate.  They existed as tropes and were lacking in much agency.  Each one was designed as a fantasy for the author, and it was clear he was seeing himself as the main character.  Some readers will love that, but for me it ended up lacking.  I want to read about people I'd enjoy meeting and chatting with.  I actually have a hard time putting myself in the role of the main character in most tales, and this kind of harem fantasy definitely is not a genre that draws me in easily.<br /><br />This was one of the worst of the genre in my opinion.  As I said, I disliked the three female characters due to their lack of agency and personality.  But I will warn, that my opinion is based on my personal preferences.  I expect someone who likes this kind of tale will very much enjoy this book.",Negative
"Azaria as a dungeon had a ton of power.  Lance as this wandering dungeon diver with ""absorption"" abilities had a ton of power.<br /><br />So, the only solution was to create even more powerful enemies and rip the entire city of Neo-Chicago from the surface of the planet.  Now Azaria must exercise even more power, and Lance's ever increasing abilities dwarf those of any other being on the planet.<br /><br />I wanted to vomit.  I hate this kind of writing.  This story ran straight into one of my biggest complaints in that too much power was handed out to the ""heroes"" which resulted in the villains having to be far too powerful as well and the plot becomes a mess in seconds.<br /><br />This story was very much a problem of a like v like conflict where the original side was already overpowered.  In a clash of titans, you end up with the monsters fighting blindly while flattening the world around them.  (think Godzilla v any monster in the older Kaiju films from Japan.  The humans are mere spectators as entire cities get stomped on.)<br /><br />I don't like this kind of story.  It works with Godzilla because of the nature of the tale.  Godzilla is not really a character, but rather a force of the plot that moves around and guides the story as the humans who are the real characters must react to him.  In this series of Doll Dungeon, Azaria is clearly thought of as a major character, but she's too powerful to really be one.  And her dungeon is not a factor.  She does use her powers to protect Neo-Chicago, but we actually never get to see much of her third floor.<br /><br />I just didn't care for this tale and by the time Azaria is marshalling her forces to assault another dungeon I had lost interest.  The chaos and the power levels just distorted the plot.<br /><br />I don't want to really speculate as to why this book did so poorly for me, but it did.  I cannot recommend this to anyone.",Negative
"Joy.  I've found another angst trick that authors might use.  How many more authors will try the same?  Honestly, even one is too many.<br /><br />This tale is an isekai where the main character is somehow torn from his happy life on Earth and dropped into a world of beast-kin, magic and lots of conflict and betrayal.  Its a tale as old as time in a way.  Sadly, while the foundation is simple, this author manages to munge up the tale by having the hero be contrary with people who have knowledge and yet also be far too stupid to live.  Heck, his first harem member calls him Idiot for a while because he doesn't listen and likes to stubbornly argue with her even when doing so can be dangerous.  (and gets them in at least one fight when they are delayed long enough to get caught.)<br /><br />I hated the MC because of his stubborn stupidity, and as always that made me dislike the plot and the rest of the tale.  Sadly, it was clear that his attitude was an attempt by the author to make him seem like a bit less of a jerk than the usual harem fantasy male leads who bounce from bed to bed without any remorse or emotional tie to their victims.  Here he did have some romance, but its buried until teenage style angst due to morals that clearly didn't play in the world.  Yes, some men might fight for their old school morals, but honestly, I think most men dropped into such a world are going to realize ""When in Rome.....""<br /><br />I gave up due to the angst.  That's the last I can say here.",Negative
"This story seems to have a premise that the author believed in.  Its not poorly written, although I think the MC was not relatable in any way.<br /><br />But its also about a strange female dominated world where men are kept in chains (in more ways than just physical) and with some strange fetishes that definitely weren't for me.<br /><br />I just couldn't really wrap my head around the premise for the world itself.  I could see the world building, and it was more solid than most I come across recently, but it was a world that my mind rejected quickly.  Unfortunately if you reject the world building, the rest of the story tends to fall flat, and that happened here.  With the foundation of the story not to my liking, I couldn't find the entertainment.<br /><br />Others will like the matriarchal society with the strange enforcement and history, but it wasn't for me and sadly, that leaves me giving the tale just 2 stars.  I find that I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.",Negative
"This story starts with a strange gladiatorial fight, but then jumps to a class of girls being trained up to join the Mystical Slayers.  There are hints that the world is under a one company order, but the explanations made no economic sense.  (not a huge surprise as most of the anti-corporate stories lack a real understanding of how business works, and this story had clear anti-corporate plot threads.)<br /><br />And that resulted in a world that I'm not sure the author had defined in his mind.  Honestly, I couldn't get the characters because the whole plot felt like it was just floating away from the shore on a rip current.  It hadn't been given a foundation to tie the plot to something.  I had little to no clue what the first fight was about, and then we jumped in time and space without an explanation or any idea of what the fight was about, for, or who won.<br /><br />I can't even say that the idea was good.  I just couldn't find it in the way the story flailed around.",Negative
"This story has a badly disjointed start and a ""hero"" who is openly criminal in nature, nasty, near berserk and just unpleasant.  And that were what I thought were his good points.<br /><br />And from that you get a tale that did not interest me.  I don't like anti-heroes unless they are well done, but that never happens.  Too many inexperienced authors think they can make a criminal hero work and Nick here joins the ranks of those who have gotten me to shake my head at how poorly their efforts play out.<br /><br />Just not worth your time unless you like villainous characters pretending to be heroic.",Negative
"Wow.  I think I've read too many tales where the genie is so much better than the duo in this tale.  And it wasn't the ""you only get 3 wishes"" part (which interestingly enough comes from the tale of the Genie in the Lamp, not Aladdin.  In the original Aladdin there is no limit to the wishes.)  It was in part the ""oh we can't create anything"" trick, which again doesn't come from any previous genie tale I've encountered.  Now sure, one might argue ""But Simon Archer wanted to be different.""  And I'd agree, but that doesn't change the fact that I found the changes off-putting.  It felt like another attempt to artificially reduce the power thrust upon the main character.  And I find that those work about as well as the times that there is too much power.  It needs to feel natural.<br /><br />this one felt forced, and that bounced me completely out of the tale.  Simon Archer has written some good tales, but this one missed in my opinion.",Negative
"the barbarian in the tale is poorly defined and even when the story looked over his shoulder with him as the focal character.  he also despite being a barbarian who hates magic and yet has travelled to a magical school to try to control his uncontrollable magic, is just bland.<br /><br />The story does telegraph the fact that sex is going to be a huge part of the tale.  I have no major problem with the sex, but I still want a more fleshed out tale with a plot that draws me in.  This one somehow managed to repel me.<br /><br />Its mostly the same issue I have with too many ""harem"" tales.  The girls are more a collection of body parts and hormones than fleshed out characters.<br /><br />I can't say much more.  It was just disappointing overall.  It's definitely a product of the genre, but sadly, that means little in a genre that often fails to tell good tales.",Negative
"The world made no sense, the history of the world made less sense.  The main character is a bit of a whiny brat at the start and never seemed to show much in the way of brains.  His companions were worse in many ways.<br /><br />In the end it was a standard harem plot with nothing new, combined with less than special characters who failed to make an impression.  I felt this book wasn't good enough to do mroe than finish and quickly delete from my kindle.  Its just not very good.",Negative
"I seem to either love a Garrett P.I. novel or I hate it.  This one was one I hated.<br /><br />Worse, I can't put my finger directly on why I didn't get into it.  I think a huge part was that the mystery seemed contrived in this case.  Most of the time Garrett stumbles into a mystery because of a friend or someone down on his luck.  This time the rich and powerful and the wizards come to him begging for him to stop some mystic tournament.<br /><br />That plot seemed designed to make me dislike the tale from the start.  It lacked the joy that was Garrett in the earlier books, and really didn't play out like the usual &#34;film noir in a fantasy universe&#34; tale that makes the best books in this series a pleasure to read.  The heart and fire and fun was gone.<br /><br />For a series that has seen books published for more than twenty years I have to admit I'm impressed that Glen Cook can still come up with ideas, but this was a horrible one, and my recommendation to anyone is to skip this book.",Negative
"I've been reading the works of David Weber for more than a decade.  His early works are amazingly tight stories with good characters and a plot that moved smoothly.<br /><br />However, his last few stories have ended up being ponderous works where page after page is a long slow exposition describing the antics of the villains.<br /><br />War Maid's Choice falls into the second category.<br /><br />It's a story with interesting characters, who get very little time on the page.  Weber seemed to feel the need to have every second chapter be about the villains and they discussed their plot, or moved it forward with another strategm that would take twenty pages or more to describe, when the simple description was ""convince person A to back person B in front of the king.""<br /><br />The story was painful to read.  Once again in a Weber novel the villains just aren't worth reading about.  They were cliche and over-the-top much like a James Bond Villain is, but not ain a good way.  The playfulness that makes James Bond villains fun is lost in the pedestrian intrigue.<br /><br />Bahzell remains a great character, but this story doesn't give him much time to grow.  Brandark and Warsharno get even less time, but this story is supposed to be about Leeana, and where her life is going seven years after Wind Rider's Oath ended.<br /><br />She gets some good scenes and had definitely grown as a character, but the story limited her in subtle ways.<br /><br />In the end, this felt like another ""filler"" work.  Weber even telegraphs that he's thinking of at least one more book and that certain characters are important to future installments.  The problem is that its not good filler work.  The final scenes are good, but I couldn't feel that all the time I spent fighting through the muck of the overwritten intrigue and plotting was worth the climax.  It ended up feeling extremely hollow to me.<br /><br />Someone needs to get David Weber into a private office and talk to him about the direction his writing is going.  His earlier works are fun, well written and focus on single characters without the outrageous emphasis on showing everything the villains are doing.  His recent works spend far to much time giving the details of the villains plans without rewarding the reader for learning this information.<br /><br />Unless you are a huge fan of this series, stick to the first two books and don't bother with Wind Rider's Oath and this book, they are not worth the time.",Negative
"I've read that John Ringo basically wrote the books in this series over the course of a few months of frantic writing.  I have not read the others, but this was a gritty description of commando style spy antics combined with almost BDSM sexual scenes.<br /><br />The military scenes and descriptions are solid.  However, they couldn't carry the story and the overall plot just felt a bit thin.  The sexual scenes felt almost forced at time and did not expand much upon the plot.  I could see a male reader wishing he was the main character with his almost mystical ability to pleasure a woman and win her adoration, but in a way the scenes detracted from the characters and their impact.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have read books 1 and 2 first so I could get more into the story, but I was able to figure out the basic personalities of most of hte characters, even if I did not know how they became friends and allies.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that will only be enjoyed by a select audience.  The sexual scenes will be considered offensive by some, but as always John Ringo's personal politics bleed into the politics of his writing.  As a writer he has a great talent, but his works can end up seeming a bit juvenile due to his style and politics.  This one fell into the juvenile category.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.  There are other better books out there.",Negative
"This is a review I didn't want to write.  I genuinely like David Weber's writings.  I own most of the books he's produced and loved On Basilisk Station when it first came out.  This series has been a huge breath of fresh air in the world of science fiction writing.<br /><br />Sadly, this series is also a wonderful example of a storyline that has been extended far past the original scope.  David Weber seemed to be flailing around more than a bit as he tried to hold the pieces of the plot together.<br /><br />There are many things that have gone wrong in this world.  At first it was about one person and her uncanny ability to get a ship's crew to excel in combat.  Yes, the combats were in some ways simple.  Originally missles were described as more of a standoff weapon while energy weapons and fighting in a line like 18th century warships was the standard.  However, the technology kept becoming more and more powerful, and missiles have become the uberhammer in the universe.  This book not only notes it, but emphasizes it with many of the discussions the characters get involved in.<br /><br />And sadly, the bad guys are showing almost no character development.  Haven and its people were textured and deep with many of the characters showing shades of gray in their personalities and motivations.  The ""five mandarins"" of the Solarian League and the Detweiler clones who run the Mesan Alignment are extremely 2-dimensional.  Sure the supposed plots that Weber has them conducting might appear complex, but the foundations are simple and the motivations are just too obvious.  There is no attempt by David Weber to add nuance to the characters.<br /><br />And as others have said, this read like a very long setup for later books.  Overall, it was like one of hte middle books in The Wheel of Time, there was a lot of filler and exposition, but the plot moved incrementally.<br /><br />This series has been suffering since the first ""Podnaughts"" appeared, and has seemed to almost lose it's way.  Mission of Honor had many unnecessary deaths and new technologies that appeared to exist solely to help boost the power of a new bad guy.  It was almost like reading a bad comic book where the villain suddenly gains a new power just to add in more danger.  The early books were character driven, with the personalities of the characters being a major component of hte story.  A Rising Thunder downplays the individual characters.<br /><br />This story is lost in ""epic"" mode.  Weber is best when he can keep the story focused on a few specific characters, rather htan try to write about every action taking place in his universe.<br /><br />For lovers of the series, this will add a few details and does push towards a couple of major confrontations in later books, but in my opinion it is a major disappointment.",Negative
"This is one of the more difficult reviews I've ever tried to write.  Reading Kushiel's Dart I found myself torn over how I felt about the book.  The reviews here are mostly highly complementary and praised Jacqueline Carey for the artistry of her writing.  And yet, I feel obligated to rate this story at 2 stars.<br />To be honest, if the claims of the positive reviews had been a little less overblown I might be inclined to have pushed this up to 3 stars.  The story is not horrible, and I was more disappointed than upset, but the flaws are obvious and definitely impacted my enjoyment.<br />The book does have good points.  While I disagree with the ""intricately plotted"" claim, it does have a solid plot thread carried through the entire story and the story is coherent around the single plot thread.  The character development Is limited, but solid and as many positive reviewers point out Jacqueline Carey is very skilled at painting with words.  Her descriptions of a fanciful land of beautiful people who are commanded to ""Love as you will"" are stirring.<br />Unfortunately, many of the virtues became vices when taken too far, and that happened here.<br />Intricately plotted is one of the common comments, but the basic plot is not very intricate.  The story plays out as a tale of national politics and the succession to the throne of a country.  I found the rest of the plot neither intricate, nor unusual.  I've read many mysteries that were far more confusing and clouded.  Here everyone's motives are rather transparent, even the one villainess that Jacqueline Carey clearly sees as the Moriarty of the tale.  And while there are a number of factions, none plays a true doublecross.  Each moment of the plot occurs in sequence with almost no simultaneous actions.  After reading stories like George R.R Martin's epic, the plotting here is actually rather pedestrian.<br />The character development is one of the largest drawbacks.  Each character is lovingly described by Jacqueline and I'm sure that many readers will say that they ""loved"" one or more characters.  The problem is that after one clear description almost none of the characters change.  Even Phedre remains much the same at the end of the book as she was in the beginning, and she grows the most.  Many of the other characters are introduced once and then barely seen again.<br />My biggest complaint has to be the same flowery and vivid descriptions that many reviewers loved.  They did help bring parts of the story to life, but they also slowed the story down.  The whole first third of the story is backstory.  When the first major plot twist finally occurs it not only isn't a surprise, but its almost a welcome relief from the chapters of descriptions of Phedre's service to her master.  Not that the later chapters necessarily change much.  I could use a simpler description of how Phedre solves many of her problems, but it would be perhaps a bit unfair to future readers.  It was less imaginative than I would have expected and after a while definitely more than a bit repetitive.<br />In the end I did not dislike the book, but after having my expectations raised so high by other reviewers I was extremely disappointed.  The feeling I got was that this book receives its reviews partly because it was rather unique.  Before this book was written, few authors tried to write a romantic tale of political intrigue in a world where prostitution is a religious event and have the heroine be not only a pseudo-priestess, but the chosen of the demigod of masochists.  Its definitely a titillating idea and had to influence many of the reviewers.<br />I will not tell anyone not to read this book.  In fact, if you took the time to read to the end of this review, I'd say that you probably will enjoy reading the book.  It's not a bad book, just a bit overhyped.  The flaws are there, but so are the virtues that brought many to give the story five stars.  I just will not add this book to my collection, nor do I expect to go out of my way to read it again.  It is what it is, a decently written first novel that managed to find a spot in literature that was rarely used, and it struck a chord with the reading audience.<br />I do suggest that people checking this review note that over time Jacqueline Carey's stories have been seeing their ratings slide.  Her third trilogy in this universe has more than a few fans saying that they are dropping her as a favorite author.  I actually came to start reading her work her through her third tiloguy and the overall quality of the writing is higher in those later books.  However, by that time many reviewers are complaining about the same issues I see in Kushiel's Dart.  The scanty plots and overwritten descriptions were always there, but many reviewers did not notice until they started the third trilogy.  Sad, because Jacqueline is a very talented writer, she just needs to put a bit more time into building the plot before publishing.",Negative
"John Scalzi wrote a rather impressive tale here, and if he had not tried to claim that this was a reimagined version of Little Fuzzy I might be willing to rate this at around the 3.5 star level.  It's well written and a rather light read.<br /><br />However,<br /><br />He openly writes about how this was an attempt to perform a reimagining on H. Beam Piper's 1962 Hugo award nominated book Little Fuzzy, and even gives the main human character the same name, and because of that I found I could not like this book.<br />The original is a light and almost funny tale.  H. Beam Piper wrote with an optimistic tone and it raised the story up.  From Jack Holloway's rugged frontierman persona, with a reputation for fiercely protecting himself and his friends, to the other people in the colony who willingly work to protect the fuzzies from the corporation, the story works to bring a smile to the reader.<br /><br />Fuzzy Nation has little of the optimism and almost none of the charm.  John Scalzi sees Jack Holloway as a disgraced former lawyer who was disbarred more than a decade before and has no real friends other than a dog who at times seems to have more personality than many of the humans.  Worse, this story delves deep in office and courtroom politics of a Zarathusra company that is far more evil than the one in H. Beam Piper's original tale.  The company now is completely heartless and throughout the book bullies the contractors and workers without a care.<br /><br />It's like John Scalzi read the worst tales of Enron and other early 21st century cases of corporate malfeasance and then distilled that to generate the ultimate evil corporation.  For me at least the corporate scenes were boring as I knew that they would twist around in an attempt to make the company look evil and Jack's anti-hero character to look good in the bargain.<br />All this brought down the story.  Fuzzy Nation is a dark and almost depressing story with a rather unsatisfying ending that is almost cynical in how it subverts its own justice.  I read this story thinking that it would have the same positive forward looking feel as the original and found myself reading a dark and depressing tale with no characters I liked.<br /><br />If you have not read Little Fuzzy, this will likely be a pleasing story, as it is well written.  If you liked the reboot of Battlestar Galatica this story will likely be one you enjoy as it does to Little Fuzzy what the reboot of Battlestar Galatica did to the original.  IF you enjoyed the original for its heart and warmth stay far away from this story.<br /><br />I like my reading fun and humorous, so I hated this book.",Negative
"It's hard to put my thoughts about this book into words.  I remember when the Wild Cards series first came out and the fun of stories about super-humans who were also often quite ""human"".<br /><br />I knew since the back cover writeup on this story suggested that it was ""inspired"" by the online RPG City of Heroes that there was a danger that it would have issues with character creation and development.  The fact that it was a multi-author effort also was something I was concerned about as the original Wild Cards would have wild variations in quality depending on which author wrote a particular chapter.<br /><br />This book affirmed all my fears, unfortunately.  Character development is sparce and by the time I got 150 pages in I realized that there wasn't a single character I cared about.  Usually I can find one, even a villian to be interested in, but here, I just wanted to see the story move on.<br /><br />The villians were effectively faceless goons in metal suits, which only added to the ""I really can't care about anyone."" attitude that built up.<br /><br />Finally I set the book down, and I know I will never pick it up.  Its just not worth the effort.",Negative
"Unlike some of these reviewers, I forced myself to read on to the end because I thought it would have to get better.  It didn't.  I just did not enjoy reading about this man who wastes all his gifts and opportunities, then goes on for years wallowing in self pity.  His whining seriously reminded me of what you hear at AA or ALANON meetings (with the addition of a few more interesting historical and artistic references).<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I am not really familiar with Rousseau? But shouldn't this novel have inspired me to find out more?  That is one of the most incredible thing about good writing; a great book sends you onto paths you might not have discovered for yourself.  Instead, this book left me with no interest whatsoever in the life and writings of the man J.J.Todd admired most.<br /><br />Then, after sticking with it for 475 pages, this is the ending you're given?  Maybe someone could explain it to me and I might change my mind in thinking that the author just ran out of energy and motivation to invent a satisfying conclusion to the story of this loser.<br /><br />I liked his book Restless, but I wouldn't recommend New Confessions to anyone.",Negative
"The book has nice illustrations but a very poor message since the father keeps putting the child down by not allowing him to express his love with his own limited words, height, or gestures.  It's bedtime and the child says, &#34;I love you this much,&#34; using the gestures that he's capable of using for his age and height.  You would expect that the loving parent would simply return the compliment and hug the kid, but no, that big Nutbrown Hair must always have the final word and make the child feel inadequate.

So as not to inflict any further harm, this book belongs in the trash.",Negative
"I purchased the book/cd package. While the dialogs inside the book are decent, the audio CD was a total disappointment. I would have been better off listening to Irish on the radio because the beginners' CD doesn't bother to break down the language; it starts at about sixty miles per hour and doesn't get any better. I accomplished more with a Hippocrene phrase book that didn't have a CD. I've learned three foreign languages and for each of them, the student is taken through steps; we learn the pronunciation of the vowels, consonants, and blends, which the Hippocrene book did. Then the student is given simple phrases (eg ""What time is it?"") at a slow or moderate pace, and we continue to build on the given theme. This ""Teach Yourself Irish"" is definitely the worst language course that I've encountered because it does nothing right.",Negative

"Incredibly slow and uninteresting story line. I love a good thriller, but this was mediocre at best. I found myself flipping through pages just to finish. I held out hope that the ending would make it worth it, but...nope. the characters were simply people no one would like or find interesting. And as a Chicagoan, we do not say ""attending University""...we say ""going to college"" or ""I go to THE university"".

"A long, long time ago, a committee was formed with three each of the species Vampires, Witches and Daemons.  The only thing that was agreed upon was that the three species should never, under any circumstances, have anything to do with each other, ever again.<br /><br />This was working reasonably well until a self-depreciating, well educated witch with a great pedigree, a go-to pair of leggings and an insatiable thirst for tea meets a 1500 year old vampire with multiple degrees, an expensive wardrobe and a thirst for vintage wine.<br /><br />In summary, the first 72% of the book (percentage courtesy of Kindle) goes as follows:<br />1. Witch visits Oxford library to check out books on alchemy. A strange book pops up that gives her the tingles, and it takes several pages of back story before she decides to open it, and several more before she actually does. Deciding that it is an extraordinary book in many ways and very magical, the distinguished historian and avid researcher simply closes it up and sends it back to the stacks.<br />2. Lots of creatures become interested in her, including aforementioned vampire dude.<br />3. She rows a lot, jogs a bit, sleeps and eats a lot, and starts consorting with the vampire.<br />4. She consumes vast quantities of tea, toast and eggs, he nibbles nuts and berries and consumes vast amounts of wine, and we learn that he smells like cinnamon and cloves and likes Montblanc writing instruments.<br />5. Between alternating phases of weakness and stubbornness, sleeping and eating, some historical accounts of various events, and scientific discussions on genealogy, a classic Harlequin romance theme slowly unfurls, frustratingly rambling on for eons.<br /><br />The last quarter or so of the book gives the reader hope that the first three quarters was not endured in vain, but sadly, other than two quick bouts of action, and a lot of groaning and sighing due to unfulfilled passionate encounters, the book ends in a most unsatisfactory fashion, never even attempting to tie up loose ends, or apologize for wasting the reader's time.<br /><br />Unlikeable main characters, a meandering storyline and far too much descriptive prose focused on the mundane totally ruin what could and should have been a fast-moving, paranormal, historical romantic adventure.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 15, 2011.",Negative
"First reaction: ""I'm actually going to try an audio book!""<br />Second reaction on receiving it: ""Holy #### !!!

(You know which one I mean)<br />Sixth reaction: ""Just a few more CDs to go.""<br />Seventh reaction: ""That's IT??????""<br /><br />Suffice to say that I didn't get the much lauded supreme wonderfulness of this story, which involved a group of unrealistic characters doing a bunch of unlikely activities, and was, for the most part, extremely boring.  Unlikely as it seems, even the supposedly steamy parts could only be described as tepid, and I found myself wondering on several occasions why the character would even consider doing or saying some of the things they do and say in the story.<br /><br />Also, and please bear in mind that this is my first attempt at an audio book, I was wondering why they would use a male narrator when most of the speaking/thinking/arguing/shouting/crying/pouting is done by women.  The narrator, to his credit, is extremely consistent with his various voices, and you can easily tell which character is speaking throughout the arduous journey, not that you'd actually care after the first few CDs.<br /><br />Nineteen CDs worth of my life, totally wasted.

"The things this book has going for it are as follows:<br /><br />Great dog stories<br />Great dog<br />Dog<br /><br />Let's face it, the most interesting thing about this memoir is how the dog interacts with the author and his friends and roommates.  More like a blog, I didn't care for the writing style, or for the repetitive reporting on beach house parties, cycling expeditions and whatnot.<br /><br />Yes, he does have an unusual bunch of roommates, and his experiences are stranger than fiction, but this isn't really surprising as the main criterion for selection is having someone to look after the dog.<br /><br />Billed as a memoir, we really don't learn very much about the author, except that his wife left him, he has a wonderful dog, and that he leaves the dog behind on a regular basis while in the pursuit of happiness.  It comes over as a rather one-dimensional look at a certain period of his life, and I really wish the author had fleshed out his experiences and provided us with more detail and depth.<br /><br />While this book didn't do it for me, it may be of interest to people who like golden retrievers, the singles scene, and first person accounts of bad roommates.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 2, 2010",Negative

"James Patterson enters the young adult fiction arena with a whimper, with this far-fetched sci-fi saga which borrows heavily from the recycle bin of Dean Koontz.  The titular character (Yep, ""Maximum Ride"" is a character in the book) is the leader of a group of six children who call themselves ""The Flock"".  Each child has been subjected to genetic experimentation at a place called ""The School"", where evil scientists have ""improved"" them with avian DNA.  This has resulted in each child growing a pair of wings large enough to take flight, as well as a number of other ""side effects"" which the children are now discovering.<br /><br />Max is fourteen years old, and can fly at supersonic speed using her thirteen foot wingspan.  Amazingly, she can fold away her wings somewhere in the framework of her 5' 8"" body so that she appears to the world as a normal teenaged girl wearing a hoodie.<br /><br />Fang is the tall, dark and handsome one who is amazingly strong and resilient.<br /><br />Iggy is blind, due to the scientists' failed attempts to improve his night vision. His talents include making explosive devices and cooking.  His other senses have been sharpened to compensate for his lack of vision.<br /><br />Nudge is the talkative one, and also a computer hacker with developing psychic powers.<br /><br />The Gasman a.k.a. Gazzy is a flatulent eight year old, best friend and co-conspirator to Iggy and the biological brother of Angel.<br /><br />Angel is the baby at age six, with eight foot wide white wings. She can read and manipulate people's minds, and we learn that she can also breathe underwater using invisible gills.<br /><br />The school has also produced another species called ""The Erasers"", who are children who have been ""enhanced"" with wolf DNA.  This is a handsome species, until they start morphing into super strong werewolf-like beings.  The Erasers are the security force for The School and are licensed to kill if necessary.<br /><br />Anyway, after you've swallowed all the above, I won't burden you much longer except to say that Max and rest of the Flock originally escaped The School thanks to a scientist named Jeb, who set them up with a safe house and lived with them for a while before he disappeared.  Their happy home is thrown into disarray when Angel is kidnapped by the Erasers, and the Flock heads out into the world on a search and recovery mission.  This leads to a quest for the meaning of life, and ultimately to New York City, where Max begins hearing voices.<br /><br />Having plowed through more than 450 pages of this kind of fluff, the reader should logically expect a conclusion, but Patterson fails to deliver even this, leaving ends dangling untidily all over the place, with no ending in sight.<br /><br />I had a hard time with this one, and if your teenager has an enquiring mind I'd advise them to look elsewhere for their Sci-Fi / Fantasy needs.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 6, 2006",Negative
"This book took a lot of patience to complete, and I still can't believe I read the whole thing.<br /><br />Stuck in midstream without a paddle, it floats between romance, mystery, mayhem and madness. Evanovich's usually quirky characters fly off the believability radar like stealth bombers, unfortunately undetected by my bad book warning system.<br /><br />What starts out as a rich man, divorced woman love story in a horsey setting, becomes a comedy circus of professional wrestlers, crazy people, insects and endless (and I mean ENDLESS) repetition.<br /><br />Evanovich and Hughes seem to have forgotten the KISS principle for effective writing, and I would recommend you forget this one.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 26, 2005<br /><br />(KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid)",Negative

"My top three favorite books of all time include Hannibal by Thomas Harris with the correct, original ending. I didn't love Hannibal Rising, but I was happy enough with it. So I was excited about Cari Mora enough to pre-order the Audible version. Sadly, I'm left disappointed and a little bored after listening to it.<br /><br />The first problem is the self narration by the author. This can be wonderful, but usually doesn't work out well and this is one of those times when a professional voice actor should have been hired. The flow is not as smooth as it could be and there are awkward pauses here and there.<br /><br />I was in no way expecting a recreation of Hannibal Lector or Clarice here. Yet there are faint, very watered down echoes of both characters - for example the weird use of ""okeydoke"" here. The story includes similarly graphic, violence and vile predilections from several lead characters as well as a grim backstory for Cari. Unfortunately, these all lack the deeply thought out, twisted nobility and underhanded charm of Lector or Clarice or even Inspector Patzi. Instead, Hans-Pedro and Cari feel like cheap imposters. There is no honor or even appreciation for anything in life within these characters. I just found the whole book felt like an after thought and slapped together - even the gold as the focus of the plot, never seemed important. There are no iconic lines from Cari Mora to wiggle into our lexicon either - Mr Harris left his wit on the editor's floor I'm afraid.",Negative

It's an interesting idea for a story - following a woman as she investigates a mysterious death in an world set several decades after the gradual collapse of society as we know it.<br /><br />The problem for me is that the story moves very slowly with little actually happening. There's no tension or anxiety about what will or will not happen. The flashes back and forth between Enid's childhood and the present didn't really meld well for me. Lots and lots and lots of talk about &#34;the greatest storm&#34; and how each one becomes the &#34;the greatest storm&#34; as time goes by.

I've never heard of the author before, so I had no preconceived notions of what to expect.<br /><br />The premise here is very interesting, but make no mistake, comparisons to Dr Who stop after the words &#34;time travel&#34;. The characters here are incredibly immature and wrapped up in a seemingly never ending, teenage emotional drama. It really drags down the pace of the book and distracts from the plot.<br /><br />The plotline is scattershot and just drifting along. The only motivation for many of the character actions are greed. The Eliot character is very heavy handed with foreshadowing that just left me irritated. It's a shame because this is a book that could be fun with serious editing. It just didn't work for me.",Negative
"I had such high hopes for this book.... world size star ships, battles for survival, a mystery in space.... what's not love? It sounds like classic, old school Science Fiction Space Opera with some creative twists like an entire cast of women,  worlds that are bio-mechanical and a mysterious defection of the one world-ship Mokshi that involves the lead character's amnesia.<br /><br />In reality, the first several chapters followed the description of the space opera that I thought I was settling in to enjoy. Yet, the plot and story devolved rather rapidly in a weird mish mash of horror, monster story, quest through lower &#34;hell&#34; levels for the lead, Zan (the amnesiac) and some sort of political machinations involving a secret plot and birth by the second main character, Jayd, on a different world ship. None of these things really worked well together or tied smoothly to each other. This a case of a book that is trying to be too many things all at once and doing none of them particularly well. I never felt like I could visualize the actual world ships or their interior design/layout and that made it nearly impossible to suspend belief and immerse into the book. &#34;Stars are Legion&#34; just wasn't for me.",Negative
"It's been easily a dozen years since I last read a Xanth novel and I thought it would be fun to revisit the series again - especially with a story about a young Night Horse {shoeing} his way into a job that doesn't belong to him.<br /><br />Alas, this book just failed to live up to the joy, pun fun or even the fresh story telling of the early Xanth novels. Ghost Writer feels off to me.... The dialogue seems forced between all of the characters and honestly, the male characters resembled ill mannered, 17 year old boys without the ability to think beyond sexual gratification - as evidenced by the first &#34;dreams&#34; offered up by the Ghost Writer. Date rape....peeping tom voyeurism... not at all what I expected.<br /><br />I think I will pass on any future installments in the Xanth universe. Instead, I will cherish my memories of the first few books from my teenage years and call it a day. Sometimes it is better to let a writer ride off into the sunset.",Negative
"I wanted to like this book and I really tried, but by page 244/Chapter 28, I had to throw in the towel. It was time to admit defeat and allow myself to just not finish the book. I stopped reading and read another book and then came back to Io - twice - and still couldn't find the pace any more pleasant.<br /><br />I like the premise here and the idea very much. Aliens stranded on Earth for millions of years, cohabitating within our minds and bodies undetected until recently. Now battling amongst themselves and humans taking sides and casualties as a result. I like the fact that it takes place in India and has an Indian centric take on things like geography, food and attitudes toward life. This is totally my kind of story.<br /><br />My problem is with the very slow, plodding pace. Long drawn out conversations that rehash events we already witnessed through the action scenes, repetitive scenes of mundane things - how many descriptions of Ella training in a gym and being unable to measure up do we need or kowtowing of peons to Shura and her Quasing alien as a religious icon? In the end, the world building and background of the aliens is the story I really wanted and there was so little of it that I just lost interest.",Negative
"What should have been a terrific coffee table style reference book is reduced to a semi untrustworthy picture book. I wanted to give this to my husband for his collection and I was a little embarrassed to realized that there are number of errors throughout this book.

"For Pete's sake....REALLY? I saw &#34;dystopian future&#34; in the description and failed to do my due diligence before selecting After the Red Rain. If I had read the reviews first, I would have known to avoid this book. Instead, I waded into it blind expecting a good story to engage my imagination and maybe scare me a bit in the evenings. What I got is a mess. Plant/Human genetic recreations and DNA hybrids, blue super smart rats, cities hundreds of miles is size, a world where nothing grows, but there's still food and technology....no real world building and no explanation of any of it. Characters who just feel flat and one dimensional - honestly even by page 247, I just could not bring myself to care if Rose or Deedra lived, died or mutated into blue rodents themselves. The entire book felt like a third rate Saturday afternoon sci-fi channel movie. Even Sharknado Two had a backstory and you expect it be silly. Go read something else in this genre instead... Alive by Sigler or Mazerunner or Year 50.",Negative
"Bless her heart, but Prissy is a most frivolous and shallow little thing. At least she's pretty. That's what my Southern good manners dictate I should say and nothing more. Alas, a book review requires the whole truth. I chose to read Far Outside the Ordinary because I have cared for a terminally ill family member and as a result had a number of in-home care givers and assistants from all walks of life, I thought this book would be a reflection of the scary, funny and amazing lessons we went through. Maybe another family that came through their storm stronger and with life long friendships and a broader view of lives lived parallel to our own. Nope.<br /><br />Instead, this book is a look at a woman who took and took and took from friends, neighbours, employees, family, co-workers, and a long list and once casually tossed aside former boyfriend and just continued taking long after the crisis was over and poor Boone was in his grave. I don't begrudge Prissy her financial status or security as some other reviews have, I think the fact that she had been so insulated from money pressure warped her reality and blinded her to any number of things around her. She had this fantasy that cash would cure Boone - that is what fear of loss does to us all. However, after Boone died, Prissy never gave back to her community or friends or Duhart & Sallie. She quit a job she never earned on a whim of jealousy because she wanted a week in Europe with the girls instead....a job that a friend helped her get. She deigned to allow the plus size Sallie & Du pick out the restaurant for a lunch gathering because they don't like her healthy choices. Just two examples of an arrogant under tone that threads through the whole book and it grated on me. Had Prissy done something, anything for someone else I wouldn't be so harsh....Meals on Wheels maybe after a year of neighbors bringing her family dinners? Just skip this. Even Scarlett had a better work ethic.",Negative
"Allright... I get it... the author has been previously established as an author of ""literature"" with all the verbose, over-wrought, self important conatations the term ""fine literature"" implies. As great as that may be in another genre, it just does not carry over well to Zombies. At least not in this case. The first time the author used the word ""interregnum"" I was dutifully impressed. Hey... it's a big word and an unusual one as far as daily use goes. But by the fourth time I saw in less than 60 pages, I was annoyed and put off. Meanwhile, the story itself was slow, slow, slow and oh did I mention...SLOW? I was hoping for a bit of brainy zombie survival and rebuilding of civilization. What I got was this lonely, self absorbed, bitter, below average main character and jerky plot movement that never flowed well at all. No explanation of when or how the plague started. Nothing about specific characters that made you want to care about them in the least. Mr. Colson Whitehead would probably do better to continue to write stories in different genres and leave the Zombies to guys like Joe McKinney (Dead City).",Negative
"This book seemed to have so much potential - bad things happening in the character's life, things out of her control and literally at rock bottom. Then she wins the lottery. Instead of being strong, finding her own way, using the money for good, she whines, hides, cries incessently, mopes around, grouses when her family asks her to donate some of the money to the local animal shelter. It's $87 million dollars and this girl can't find a way to enjoy it or get her life together without drama and angst every step of the way. I finally had to give up on this one 2/3 of the way through it.",Negative
"I read this after loving all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and hating the Harper (Grave Sight et al) character and books. I was hoping to find a middle ground here that would have some of the same humor and finesse of Sookie's stories without the melodrama and creepy relationships of the Harper stories. Sadly, this book and Aurora left me cold. Real Murders felt like a book for teens. Aurora is lacking confidence, she has no panache and none of the real world intelligence that makes Sookie so real and a character you actually want to know more about.",Negative
"I really REALLY wanted to like this book and had hoped this was a series to sink into now that I've finished all the Sookie Stackhouse books. Wrong. Betsy is nothing like Sookie - no brains, no brawn, no courage, no common sense... there is nothing about this character that earns my respect or interest and she's not really funny.<br /><br />Scene after scene in the book has Betsy making fun of someone she doesn't know, assuming she is smarter and better than everyone she meets, taking advantage of her true friends, badmouthing her grieving parents after her death and resurrection, disposing of a friend's CDs because she personally doesn't care for HIS musical tastes, and in the end, Betsy essentially sells herself for shoes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am all for gorgeous handmade Italian shoes! Betsy's life revolves around her vanity AND she is a nitwit. That drove me crazy for the entire book. I kept hoping Sinclair would just stake her. I will pass on the rest of the books in this series.",Negative
"I just could not get into this book.  I have read two other books by Bob Goff, and have found that they decline in impact with each new book that comes out.  This was really disappointing.  I ended up putting this book away before completely reading it to the end, which is why I gave this book 2 stars.",Negative
"This book provided a lot of new art to me; however, I found the writings for each piece of art lacking.  I also found that the kindle edition I was reading did not include the entire work of art.  For example, I was only able to see a couple of the angels in the piece “Lamentation the mourning of Christ.”  I was familiar with this piece, but wonder how many of the artwork was partially shown.  This was disappointing to me.  I also found some of the writings not only lacking, but partly false.  In one, the author mentions “There were no mirrors in those days, so people had little or no idea what their own face looked like.”  Had they never seen themselves in a water reflection?  Overall, was this book worth it, I don’t think so.",Negative
"This book is very very psychological with lots of psychological terms.  Another review mentioned how religious this book was.  For me, this book is not religious at all.  Sure there are quotes from the Bible in it, but there are more quotes from other sources as well...the beatles, Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Simon and Garfunkel, etc.  So the authors get their inspiration from all kinds of literary works.  I would say most of the advice in the book comes from pop psychology and is not at all Biblical.<br /><br />While it is nice to know that what you are going through is something others are dealing with as well.  There is little by way of &#34;help&#34; in this book.  I was really looking forward to the chapter on Getting and Keeping the Attention of the Health-Care System.  This chapter had very little helpful advice.  It was more about the doctor's perspective...which is fine...but not too helpful to me.<br /><br />I forced myself to read this book in it's entirety, but found that I would have benefited from a different book more than this one.",Negative
"I am a huge fan of Lauren Graham's book &#34;Talking as Fast as I Can&#34;, but this book left something to be desired.

But he gives his explanations for the title.<br />All in all, I didn't see a lot that I would want to try in this book.

I was wrong.<br /><br />The book itself is very small - it is like a Reader's Digest size.<br />I just got it, and already know I won't be keeping it!<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about the history behind quilts, and finding out more about<br />how a certain quilt might have come to be, then you will like this book.<br />I do not personally follow the history of quilts or quilting, and simply enjoy the medium.<br />There are snippets of poems that mention cats or kittens throughout the book, along<br />with stories about where a certain quilt originated. Honestly, I was bored silly.<br />I adore cats and all things feline, but this book was a yawn from start to finish.<br /><br />So, this is one for quilt historians. There is no information whatsoever on how to<br />make feline forms for quilting, which is what I had hoped. It was my mistake - don't let it be yours!",Negative
I do not like books that go back and forth and only feed a little bit of the background information at a time. But that is me. I thought the book would never end.

"This book is unnecessarily wordy until the last 80 pages.  It is also another egregious example of Alan Dean Foster's failure to avoid contradictions of extreme importance.  On page 292 the KK- drive projection dish of Mahnahmi's KK ship, the Crotase, has been fired upon by the Aan ship and thus irreparably rendered unable to go into space plus or space minus.  In other words it can function in space-normal only and thus not exceed the speed of light.  25 pages later it enters space plus and disappears.  Foster can't have it both ways, but as with the varying things that Pip can and cannot escape from by spitting her poison change from one book to another, he fails to show any concern with maintaining any consistency from book to book and even from chapter to chapter.  This is the sign of poor planning - Foster used to wite better than this.",Negative
It seems like Foster is just coasting on his laurels here.  This is the only one of the books in the sequence that I own that I haven't felt any desire to reread.  He started out with a bang but he's been going downhill as he nears what is hopefully the end of the sequence.,Negative

There are only five pages on Pivot Tables, one of the most crucial topics to be covered.  Not only are macros not mentioned in the table of contents - they aren't even mentioned in the complete (for this book) index.  This is no more than an introduction to Excel 2007.  Granted it's a nicely done introduction, but it's at most a book which could be used as the basis for a half-semester class in Junior High School.

"Oh, my.  This COULD have been a really nice introduction to coloring mandalas.  Unfortunately, it fails in production.<br /><br />The good:<br /> -- Introduction is informative (with some issues -- see below).<br /> -- Designs are printed on one side of the page.<br /> -- There are over 100 (I counted 111) designs to color with a lot of variety in terms of detail, style, etc.<br /><br />The not so good:<br /> -- Introduction is in black and white -- no color -- so all the discussion of color is sort of pointless.<br /> -- In the section of the introduction on &#34;Felt-Tip Markers,&#34; no distinction is made between alcohol-based markers and water-based markers.  In fact, the technique they suggest for &#34;painting&#34; with markers (drawing with the marker on a saucer, then using a damp paint brush to pick up the color and paint with it) will work only with water-based markers (like Tombow DualTips or Crayola SuperTips), NOT alcohol-based markers (like BIC Mark-Its or Sharpies, for example).  Given that beginners may or may not know the difference, the author missed a great opportunity here.<br /> -- There's a brief mention of &#34;shading,&#34; but no examples to show what it looks like (and without color, it would be difficult to show anyway).<br /> -- The paper used is not good quality, certainly not as good as even some of the more inexpensive coloring books (Dover, for example).  Water-based markers and gel pens bleed through almost as badly as alcohol-based markers.<br /><br />The terrible:<br /> -- Almost ALL of the designs are too large for the page, so you lose a little of the design on both sides but not top-bottom. (see photos below).  Nearly every single image is missing a slender &#34;slice&#34; of the outer side edges of the design.  The &#34;Look Inside ... &#34; doesn't show this.  So if it's important to you to have the entire image to color, you might want to think twice about adding this to your collection of coloring books.<br /> -- It's impossible to remove a page to color without tearing/destroying it, and also nearly impossible to get the book to lie flat on a copier to make a photocopy onto better paper for coloring, which wouldn't do much good anyway since the image is too large for the page and you're missing a bit of the design on either side.<br /><br />As I said, this COULD have been a really nice book featuring mandalas, their history, and coloring tips/ideas.  But given the problems, I can't recommend it.  Sorry.",Negative
"Ruth Heller's ""Designs for Coloring"" series books used to be the best out there. The paper quality was such that you could use a variety of media -- pencil, crayon, marker -- with no problems.<br /><br />Not this one. The paper is almost as thin as newsprint. I can barely get it to work with good quality (Prismacolor) pencils; forget using crayons or markers.<br /><br />As much as I'd like to photocopy these onto better paper, I'm not sure that's allowable given current copyright law. If the publisher had intended the book to be used that way (as suggested by another reviewer), it would have said so in the copyright notice. Instead, it says ""All rights reserved,"" which means no copying. HOWEVER, it may be the only way to get any use out of this book.<br /><br />After this -- poor quality paper and the moral dilemma of whether or not to copy -- I'll not be purchasing any further Heller offerings. I can get Dover books at less cost, and the paper is much better quality.",Negative
"What a disappointment!  For a cookbook that claims to offer ""delicious recipes that are healthy AND easy on the budget!,"" this book leaves a LOT to be desired.<br /><br />Since when is canned chicken ""frugal""?  Since when is a HUGE amount of sodium ""healthy""?  OK, I'll give you ""fast,"" but not THAT much faster than using fresh ingredients.  Only a few dishes are seasoned with anything more than salt and pepper.  Recipes using canned diced potatoes, canned sliced carrots, canned mixed veggies,  canned pasta sauces, etc., and sodium well over 1000 mg per serving abound.  How about a chunky tomato soup consisting of 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, water, Italian seasoning, a handful of fresh kale (one of the few recipes that uses ANY fresh ingredients at all), some ground turkey, and 3 tablespoons of Spenda(?!?)?  Or a ""Creamy Chicken Noodle Soup"" using two cans of chicken breast, canned sliced carrots, chicken broth made from bouillon, minced garlic from a jar and fresh celery, with fettucine, thickened with cornstarch.  When I see a name like ""Creamy Chicken Noodle Soup,"" I expect there to be some element of ""cream"" associated with it: cream, half-and-half, evaporated milk, sour cream, etc.  Not this one.  There are several other naming ""issues"" -- minestrone that contains ground beef, chowder that is really just a vegetable soup in a clear broth, etc.  Many recipes call for ""egg whites"" -- with the suggestion to add some artificial yellow food coloring (!) to make them look more like ""real"" eggs.  Did anyone actually bother to test these recipes?  Several of the main-dish recipes call for ""vanilla yogurt"" combined with ""Cajun seasoning,"" canned pasta sauce or canned tomatoes.  Surely they mean *plain* yogurt??<br /><br />But my biggest beef (no pun intended) with this book is the lack of quality fresh ingredients.  Honestly -- fresh chicken will almost always be cheaper than canned; fresh veggies will be cheaper (and contain more nutrients) than canned (I don't have as much of an issue with frozen veggies, as they tend to be more nutrient-rich than canned).  And the time to table when using fresh ingredients isn't THAT much different!<br /><br />There are a number of VERY good cookbooks that address the need to create nutritious meals quickly and on a budget -- do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

I really wanted to like it, and I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did.<br /><br />A handful of the many problems:<br /><br />1.  The main character just isn't likable.  At all.  She's annoying, and the author has made her even more so by specifically laying out her southern accent (albeit inconsistently).  Frankly, by about 1/3 of the way through the book, I just didn't care any more about her.<br /><br />2.  The story jumps around like a frog on speed.

"in the interest of full disclosure, i did not buy this book.  however, i read it in the course of about an hour while sitting at the bookstore.  you too should read it for free, if at all.<br /><br />first off, the author has no real love motorcycles, but the neo-harley dentist/accountant scene that the ""american"" pig iron scene has become.  the photos of him and his friends are enough to make me want to avoid any of the rides, bars, rallies, and scenes that the book describes.  frankly, dear author, with your stringy long hair, gauntlets, black leather, and overweight motorcycle, you all look a bit light on your toes.  and don't bother with the sportsters, they aren't heavy enough, expensive enough, and can actually be ridden.<br /><br />second, the cavalier attitude about drinking and riding is disgusting.  the main point given to not do so is financial.  never mind that riding a bike so large that one can barely control it under the best of circumstances is dangerous, add some alcohol to the mix and create a dangerous situation for everyone.  please, dear author, maintain also your cavalier attitude about wearing your helmet and do us all a favor.<br /><br />third, to state that harleys now have a modern engine is wishful thinking, at best.  it is still the same 45 degree pig that it always was, prone to shaking itself apart and mismatched power stroke that makes one grind their teeth.  even buell, dear author, has gone to a modern rotax engine that puts the harley engine to shame.<br /><br />fourth, liberal use of the 'F' word does not a biker make.  nor does a liberal sprinkling of 'custom' off the shelf, bolt on, chrome trinkets make a custom bike.  i've been riding a long time, have completely disassembled my own bike and rebuilt it how i wanted it (and no, it isn't american and its not japanese), and nothing makes me more amused than to see a bunch of middle aged nobodies riding a bunch of off-the-showroom-floor pigs, all dressed in black and looking for all the world just what they are: overgrown boys that finally have the $30K to buy into a scene and maybe missed their exit for masquerade ball.  oh, and trucking your bikes to the rallies and/or flying is about your speed.  you earned those scratches on your bikes, buddy.  gotta love it.<br /><br />fifth, if motorcycle gangs don't like to be called gangs and/or gang members, they shouldn't behave as such.  sorry, but any 'club' that sells drugs, prostitution, guns, and resolves disputes with violence as their main source of income is a gang.  it is what it is, get over it.<br /><br />lastly, the bullet lists were somewhat helpful.  lists of things that one needs on the road, things to watch out for, etc., are about the only thing worthwhile in this waste of paper.  but you have to look at skull and crossbones instead of proper bullets, oh brother.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and read zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.  the reading is better, the author actually cares, and the lists are much more useful.<br /><br />and the 'F' word simply isn't necessary to get your point across.",Negative

There's NO new sci-fi in this.  Scalzi is famous for his endings and the ending of this one has zero zing to it.  If you haven't read Scalzi before, read Old Man's War or the interdependency series.  Scalzi has been one of the most imaginative and thought provoking and entertaining authors of sci-fi.  EVER.  This novella isn't in the same ballpark.  I truly hope John can get his mojo back.",Negative

"As this book was written by Sloan who worked on the show, I expected a wealth of behind the scenes trivia and stories from the set. What I got was. . . well. . confusing. Each chapter is devoted to an episode, so only a few are covered. The majority of the chapter is a retelling of what happens in the show including large blocks of dialog but not in script form. That would have been a better read.<br /><br />Even the choice of episodes covered is odd though there seems to be a leaning toward ones that featured Kermit. Which works for me because I love him, but other fans might feel there isn't enough emphasis on the actual lead characters  Peter and Caine.<br /><br />Glad to have anything written about my favorite show but for the price I was expecting more than just the recaps that can be found online.",Negative

"I have all of the PW cookbooks and pre-ordered this one as soon as I knew it was being written.  I love watching Ree and think she is great, however this book was disappointing to me.  I spent time looking through the book and it took a while before I found a recipe I'd even want to try.  Like others have mentioned, there's a lot of basic stuff here and it felt like I could find many of these types of recipes with an easy online search.  And I'm probably unlike most here when I say that I think I'm over seeing 12 or 15 photos of each recipe.  I literally have thousands of cookbooks and I LOVE photos, but I'm sorry I really don't need a photo of each ingredient being added to a mixer or pan.  It seems distracting to the recipe instructions in this book.  Photos of tricky instructions are great, but the mundane, unnecessary photos are bothering me LOL.  I'm keeping the book but disappointed with it.  If I had seen it first in a store I would not have purchased it.  Sorry Ree, this one missed the mark.<br /><br />Edited to add that I've decided to return this book.  After going through it again I realize I will never use it.",Negative

Book arrived with a piece of sticky candy stuck on all the edges of the bottom of the book. Had to cut the largest amount off with a sharp knife and then remove the rest with a damp cloth.

I know people are going crazy over this book but don't waste your money there are plenty of blogs and articles on the internet. Nothing in this book is any different than what anybody says. There is no magic information that you will find. In my opinion I don't really think that this is a new concept for I have been doing most of the stuff for most of my life anyway. Buy this book if you just want to learn how to fold clothes because that's all I got out of it. If you must read this book go to the library for free.,Negative

"Life is too short to read a book that doesn't capture and retain my interest. I started this, put it down. Picked it up again, put it down. I was like.. I really need to finish this so I can review it. Wait, no.. the fact that I am not getting into it IS my review.<br /><br />I mean, read the story synopsis. Sounds like it should be an attention grabbing fun read, right? It reads awkward, and the style and timing is a little confusing. I think that is primarily why I fade out and feel extra sleepy almost immediately. I am not gloming onto the story or the characters in an immersive way. Bummer.<br /><br />I do like some of the wording/phrasing.<br /><br />I may get inspired to finish it off. I hate starting and stopping.. but I am trying to learn to let go and not finish if a book isn't doing anything for me. here is so much out there to read. We'll see. If/when I do, and if I find anything else worth sharing I will come back to do so.<br /><br />2 stars. Not super terrible, but not doing anything for me, either.",Negative
"I expected a more profound take away. Yes, it is a very quick, simple read. You will have it completed under and hour even with slow, thoughtful reading and reflection. I have a huge library of leadership books and some include allegories and fables. They have their place., and can be phenomenally helpful. It is a way to introduce a complicated, messy topic into manageable, understandable bits of information. Often the story style can leave long lasting mental bullet points as the images combine with the information to provide salient take aways. Easy to remember and draw from as needed. HOWEVER, I did not experience that with this book. You might, and if you elect to buy this book hopefully you get something out of it.<br /><br />I thought this fell short. I truly expected more from it. I thought the title clever, and since it is touted as ""a fable about workplace communication and coming together in a crisis"", that it may be EXTRA relevant to what the world is going through with the current pandemic and economic situation. Even outside current events, I still expected a deeper and more informative read even when presented in simple, children's book format.<br /><br />So what you do get:<br />-- Oddly described and strangely illustrated characters. I couldn't identify with any of them, and really couldn't identify anyone with them.<br />--63 pages of story.<br />--a section on insights as well as a section of questions for ""reflection and discussion"".<br /><br />The primary take away is communication and knowing your employees. You need to be direct and clear in what you say and how you say it. Your employees need to feel valued beyond what they are producing. Basically find what the employee responds to that assures them that you care. Go to where they are, not have them come to you. If you are aware of the 5 love Languages, or any of the personality inventories (Johari, DISC, MBTI) or other assesments such as Color Personality Tests, then you know all you need to know and more-- as this book/story barely touches it (yet is clearly based on it).<br /><br />I am trying to figure out who this would be good for. I won't say there is no value, it just doesn't warrant the price (in any offered format), nor the hype in the praise section. Perhaps if you rarely read- need something quick and not too deep--or if you are very new at leadership and management, then maybe this will be eye opener, a springboard into wanting to learn more. That's it. It would also be ok as part of a small group homework-- read it, get together and discuss it. Try to get as much out of it as you can beyond the story. Discussion in real time may be the most beneficial aspect. The book is the catalyst. Again, I still think it is lacking, and don't really recommend it.",Negative
"Very few pictures, and the ones that are included aren't all that helpful. Highly disappointed. My review includes a break down of pics included, chapter titles, what additional information the recipes include, and summary of thoughts.<br /><br />Let me elaborate on my thoughts..<br /><br />I cook. I am not a great cook, but I have been cooking for long time- much more than a novice but not a consistent pro. I can throw things together and make them taste pretty good, or I can follow a recipe with same results. I am adventurous eater, so I can visualize a lot of recipes. I have a small selection of cookbooks, and of course we all have the internet.. so when I add a cookbook to my collection it has to be special, and it really should included many pics. So yes, I rate based on wanting pictures with my recipes. It is what makes me decide on going through the effort to make someones recipe- that I can see it and taste it in my mind through use of my eyes first. It also helps to know what something should look like. Helps me decide if the textures depicted in pictures are what I want at that time. I can not say enough how important, helpful, and saleable a recipe book WITH PICTURES is. If need be, if one didn't want a pic per page- then put a punch of thumbnail pics on a page with title of what it is. Or at least a representation of most recipes. But if there is a section with 20 recipes, and there is but one pic? One thing to be a book on how to cook, and how to perhaps cook the classics (whether meat or plant based)- but to have an assortment that has some unique traits to it.. how can anyone fully visualize it. So to not have and pics, or to have so few (and what is there is still not helpful). Show me what the heck Japchae is instead of the glob of coconut whipped cream that is included. Really? Pretty sure we can all visualize that.<br /><br />Ok, so here are the PICTURES THAT ARE INCLUDED:<br />--Nice cover photo- I'd eat that! is that recipe included? Could have specified what it is. After hunting through book, I deduced that it is called, ""Sweet Corn Butternut Squash Flatbread""<br />-Picture of spiralized carrots<br />-Picture of a mix of spiralized stuff<br />-Another pic of just raw spiralized stuff<br />-One more pic of raw spiralized stuff<br />-Sorry, yet another pics of raw, spiralized vegetables<br /><br />CHAPTER pics- There are nine recipe chapter with several recipes in each chapter- easily 10-20 recipes per. Many lost opportunities to show us what these recipes look like.<br />-Pic of ""Cinnamon & Sweet Potato Waffles"" at beginning of BREAKFAST chapter<br />-Pic of ""Banh Mi Bowl"" at beginning of BOWLS chapter<br />-Pic of ""Garlicky Sage Oven Fries"" (spiralized potatoes) at beginning of SNACKS & SIDES chapter<br />-random Pic of spiralized sweet potato.<br />-Pic of ""Sweet n' Spicy Beet Wraps"" at beginning of SANDWICHES & WRAPS chapter<br />-Pic of ""Sweet n' Spicy Fruit Salad"" at beginning of SOUPS & SALADS chapter<br />-Pic of ""Spicy Soft Tacos"" at beginning of MAINS chapter<br />-Pic of ""Pumpkin Spiced Apple Parfait"" at beginning of DESSERTS chapter<br />-Pic of ""Mango Harbanero Seltzer Water"" at beginning of DRINKS chapter.<br />-Pic of ""Coconut Whipped Cream"" at beginning of STAPLES & SAUCES chapter<br /><br />To further break down the book in case the lack of pics isn't an immediate deterrent:<br /> Introduction<br />Chapter 1, pg 1: Ribbons, Spirals & Shoestrings<br />Chapter 2, pg 13: Breakfast<br />Chapter 3, pg 35: Bowls<br />Chapter 4, pg 55: Snacks and Sides<br />Chapter 5, pg 69: Sandwiches and Wraps<br />Chapter 6, pg 87: Soups and Salads<br />Chapter 7, pg 105; Mains<br />Chapter 8, pg 141: Desserts<br />Chapter 9, pg 163: Drinks<br />Chapter 10, pg171: Staples and Sauces<br />... finishes up with charts on Measurement Conversion, Resources, and Index<br /><br />-Recipes include how servings, prep time, cook time<br /><br />-Recipes include info stating such information such as Nut Free, Soy Free, Gluten Free, Under 20<br /><br />-Recipes include info stating nutritional information such as calories, total fat, total carbs, fiber, sugar, protein, sodium<br /><br />-Some recipes included Prep or Ingredient tips.<br /><br />At first glance, I just sort of skimmed book and felt the desire to put it down. If I were in a book store, that is exactly what I would have done. It would have been a passing glance. No matter how good the recipes may be, I would pass over this book. Since I am reviewing it- I picked it back up and began reading the recipes. Trying to visualize them and taste them in my mind. There are a few that I am keen on trying. But many I will pass on.<br /><br />The font for the letter ""T"" looks like an ""F"" at times, which gave me a giggle one one of the recipes looked like it reads ""lemon-mango fartlets"", or ""fangy cucumber salad""<br /><br />If a redo is considered, I would include pics, organize the pay layout- pare it down to one page per recipe, clearer font, and perhaps a few more novel sounding (looking!) recipes. Give me something I can't already find super easy on an internet search.",Negative
"Of the 126 pages, I found the initial 33 pages the most interesting and helpful. This section is a primer on working with colored pencils, distinguishing between the different types (artist, regular, oil based, wax based, water soluble, etc), supplies and tools, shading techniques, color wheel, blending, burnishing, and layering techniques. All helpful information whether new to drawing or looking to brush up on a forgotten skill. If you are current on your skills, then this section would be a skip over. I am not new to drawing or painting, but it has been long enough that I feel like I need some of the elementary aspects of it to be reviewed.  So for me, the first section was a pleasant reminder and rekindled my desire to draw.<br /><br />However, the next sections kinda lose me. The drawing exercises just get increasingly presumptive that the reader already knows how to draw and that there has been no lapse in their skill. So I hope you know how to sketch out a brick exterior with ornate window frames before you start coloring. Or the detail and layering that goes into bringing cats and dogs to life on a page, as well as people. Can you draw a glass bottle or create a landscape with perspective? I might have at one time, but I am sorely lacking. I guess I misunderstood the intent of this book. I suppose I need to order the authors drawing book before I can make use of this?<br /><br />Even outside of that- say I am up to date on my drawing skills, something seems missing from this book. If I just wanted to use colored pencils instead of graphite or conte, then I would do so. If I was buying a book because I wanted more information on the colored pencil as a medium, I would expect more instruction on the use of colored pencils- less primer and more subject material. Since it assumes one knows how to draw, and it is about the application of color through colored pencils, then perhaps it would have been better to have a greater amount than what is given in the introduction. Make the majority of the book more like the intro, then have some exercises toward the end.<br /><br />So based on various factors, I don't know who would benefit most from this book. It doesn't quite do it for me no matter which scenario I play out in my mind (ie; beginner, advanced, curious). Again.. something just seems missing. Stand alone, I don't think there is enough instruction. Maybe paired with other book/s.  Thinking a lot about it and going over the book several times.. a middle of road 3 star rating would be too generous. I lean more 2-2.5.

"Just buy the actual book, please. Price doesn't always go into my reviews as we have all have individual working budgets. But I have to say, the information contained in this summary at $7 is way way WAY too expensive for a 30 page, large print (not fully utilized) ""summary"". Had it been more detailed like a Cliff note, or provided a time line, or a list of characters, then maybe I would find it worthwhile. But is a a super generalized gist of each chapter.<br /><br /> It's... ok. It isn't rubbish, but it isn't as telling as it could be. It reads too generically. At best, it might refresh the story for someone who has read the book. It may even give a glimpse into the story for someone who hasn't read it, but is considering it. BUT that same $7 could go toward just buying the book-- and the book is AMAZING. SUCH a well written, super disturbing, true crime, page turning story. In fact, I have purchased the book twice, brand new- one when it came out for me, then I lent it out. Then when it never came back to me, I bought another because I referred to and recommended it so often. I love having it in my library. Such disturbing history told in spellbinding manner.<br /><br />That being said, I desperately wanted a summary book. I had even mentioned something like that in my 5 star review for the book itself- how it is so informative, and that it is such a tortuous story, that having a summary book to refer back to would be incredible. So when I saw this come out, I thought GREAT! And I bought it despite my reservation toward the price. Now that I have read it, and read it in just under 15 minutes, I don't sense being all that refreshed on the subject matter. And had I not read the book yet, I know I would not have gained enough information to be able to talk about the book. When it comes to deciding to read the book or not, just go look at the reviews or use a search in general about it.<br /><br />Save yourself the $7 on this, and just apply it to the actual book.

"A little too woo for me. Celery juice will fix everything?<br /><br />What I did like:<br />I found some of the information pertaining to viruses setting up in areas of the body which create the auto immune issues very interesting, especially as it pertains to me. I plan to do some more research on that as it was not delved into as deeply as I would like- so it was starting point information, and not anything that I could immediately buy into (despite wanting to.. so I have to do extra homework beyond the book that is meant to help me learn- and not much in the way of citations).<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />The book tends to repeat a lot with non essential information. I don't mind context, but it felt like I was being sold to, rather than educated. I am not really interested in the other books. That was kinda pushed over and over in little ways.<br /><br />The beginning is rather arduous- I'm like, get to the point already (sorry mega fans). This is one of the few times that I recommend reading or watching a truncated version. I LOVE to read, I love to read more than I have to just to have context, I was very open minded to learning about the benefits of celery juicing.. but this book is an overall miss for me. Felt like one long advertisement.<br /><br />****To be clear- I am not doubting there are benefits to consuming celery juice. It might be amazing for you-- we are not reviewing celery juice, but the book itself. I am not even against anyone trying the plan outlined in the book. I am not at all familiar with the writer or what their accomplishments or accreditations are. So in that regard I am unbiased going in. I preordered the book on a whim out of curiosity.

"I had high hopes for a fun, thrilling read. I found it rather tedious, and unfortunately underwhelming. The front end of the story was lacking in detail and development. I failed to feel building suspense. The back end of the story moved along, but was rushed in a manner that I never bought into any of it. I look for stories of this ilk to provide me with an immersive experience. With this I was waiting to be invited into the story but instead watched it flutter by.  Perhaps more history, more detail of every character, and more development (including back story) of the relationships. There were nuggets of interesting events, some really potentially wonderfully weird happenings, but it just didn't gel for me.

It is a counting picture book, presumably for children, yet it talks about funerals, prison line ups, people getting hurt, people leaving and never coming back, lost toys. I had to skip over half of it when reading it to my child. I have never seen a counting book with death and criminals in it. It is completely inappropriate for the age it seems like it is for...<br /><br />The worst part is the concept is okay, basically saying that people feel different things. But the darkness is baffling. Unless you are getting this for a teenager (who isn't going to read a counting book) I do not know who this is aimed for.",Negative
"This book was in the romance category, and that's why I choose it, but to be honest I think it was misplaced. It really was more of a fantasy. It's about a girl who is chosen to be the Dragon, or wizards, servant/girl/pupil for a decade. She is described as ridiculously clumsy, always getting dirty. He just seems mean, to be honest. He's always yelling at her and mean. Some bad, dark things happen, which really did not appeal to me such as them having to burn a bunch of poor cows who'd been taken over by dark magic. It just seemed really dark. there certainly did not seem a whole lot of romance to it. The one thing I can say was that the writing was competent. It did flow well and was written professionally. Still, it was not a book for me.",Negative
"I have a big pet peeve against books that end in cliffhangers. If I invest in reading a book, it needs to have a good ending, which this doesn't. I was not impressed by the character either. She just seemed to make silly decisions. Other books in this series have been great, but I was sorely disappointed in this book.",Negative
"After reading this book cover to cover, I had picked up only one shortcut button sequence and no tips or tricks.  This is a good book for someone who has never picked up a digital camera or an SLR camera before (if you're used to a normal 35mm camera and need to learn both digital and SLR at once you'll be overwhelmed and this can help you).  The pictures are good and the explanation is simple enough, but if you've used a digital or an SLR you can pick most of this information up without a book.  It didn't go into anything that was difficult to understand.  I bought the book before the camera and learned nothing from it, so I can imagine that if I had the camera first I wouldn't even have bothered buying the book.",Negative
Very disappointing read. Just disconnected blather.  Good enough story lines but totally disconnected and mostly unfinished.  Waste of time and money.,Negative

First let me say I review a lot of cookbooks. Rarely do I ever have any that don't grab me in some way. I got all the way to page 85 in this one and hadn't marked a single recipe. Not one. At that point I bagged out and considered it a failure. A lot of vegetarian recipes if that's your thing. I can do that on  my own and don't need a book for it.  Just not that exciting in my opinion.,Negative

"Oh my.  Well I tried to read this I really did make a concerted effort over several days. I'm normally up for this genre of book, but after 120 pages or so, I wasn't getting the point and I was really not interested in reading anymore about Puritanical New England. Boring... Oh yeah I said that already. Sorry, but I didn't finish it. Life is too short to read bad books.",Negative

"I don't know what the author thinks ""love"" is supposed to be but this book left me feeling sick and so heartbroken for her; the fact that this is more biography than anything fictional is just awful. There is so much abuse, mental illness, and gas lighting in this book I could barely read more than a few pages at a time. It's been a long time since I've read a book that left me feeling so off and depressed after reading it but this one is sure to do that to anyone with a conscience. Absolutely do not recommend it!",Negative
"I wish I could say I just loved this book but that is not the case.  In fact, I've just never finished it. The story - a prequel to Treasure Island - seems somewhat contrived, shaping characters to of course end up fitting the characters found in Treasure Island.  But the story just didn't carry well for me and I became bored with reading it.",Negative
Good book learn a lot,Negative
"Be aware that this book is comprised of 80% only meat dishes. So many variations of the same meats... it’s silly. It’s not helpful when you want to build a full well rounded meal. What about vegetables and side dishes? I like meat, but ALL those meat recipes?<br />I rarely use this book.<br /><br />The pasta casseroles that are dairy-based contain so much evaporated milk... they taste like that, evaporated milk and not much else. The mushroom one in particular turned out appalling.<br /><br />Update : a month in and i have put this book away for good. Too many recipes turned out too mushy or disappointing.<br />Feels like these recipes haven’t been tested honestly because the results are unacceptable.<br />My family still jokes about the mushroom casserole and other failures from this books.",Negative
"I agree that the story is extremely negative and I also found the &#34;shut up&#34; and&#34;dumbo&#34; offensive, not to mention that many of the creatures were rude and ungrateful",Negative
I hated every single character in this book.  Not one person had any redeeming qualities.  In fact they didnt even have any believable qualities.  Had read Floating Twigs by this author and loved it so much.  I cant fathom the same author wrote these 2 books,Negative
"Did women stop having heads after the seventies were over? It would have been nice if I had known that these were going to be vintage sort of representations before buying this assuming it would be rather non-stylised and generic. These women appear to have come from a seventies soap opera. Otherwise, the arrangement in the book isn't bad and the images are easy to use..if you can find a use for them or modify them enough to make them fit your project. Not terrible, just not modern.",Negative
"Harlan Coben is pretty far up there in my list of favourite authors and so it pains me a little to admit that I really didn't like this book, but sadly, that is the case.<br /><br />What makes a Harlan Coben book a good read in my opinion? The fact that he can think up plots that are outside the normal everyday realm and yet make the reader believe them. He can take something ordinary and make it extraordinary. I didn't see that with this book, and here's why I feel that way:<br /><br />Flimsy plot device in the form of silly power-wielding character who causes evil by trying to prevent it. The &#34;villains&#34; in this book are numerous but ultimately I could not suspend belief long enough with the central villain to believe anyone could or would go to such extremes for such a small benefit. It reminded me of a bad rehashing of every religious-leader-gone-bad-fire-and-brimstone-cult-mentality film or book ever written.<br /><br />Even the protagonists in this story seemed to be thin on character development. Hello person that we really know nothing about, let us support you.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists, but without a strong backbone for the story, they became all jumbled together. Around every corner is a surprise of some sort, but none of them were particularly impressive to me as I felt the rest of the story still had no oomph. The main character fell flat for me, his wife we didn't ever get to know and the reader likely spends half the story thinking she was quite possibly evil incarnate. So...how are you supposed to care what happens to them? Combine that with the list of unimportant characters that keep growing and never being sure why they are doing what they are doing in the first place and I found this book to be a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />Of course, this is just my personal opinion and others might love it. I encourage you to give it a read and see what you think. The author pulled a lot of punches in this book, but I thought most of them missed the target. I also missed the humour that this author's books tend to have interspersed throughout the more serious subject matter.<br /><br />Loved the last couple of books, &#34;Missing you&#34; and &#34;Six Years&#34; were both fantastic, but this one just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher. All opinions are my own.",Negative
"When I began reading this book, I was immediately excited about learning more about one of my favourite television celebrities. Hattie kauffman has become such an influential force in the media, that I had high hopes for her memoir.<br /><br />There were some things that I valued about this book. It must have taken a lot of courage to write such a personal memoir, and I appreciated that she showed her readers a side of herself that we did not see prior to this book.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say though, this book disappointed me for a variety of reasons. Although the memoir itself was personal, I felt that it was not much different than many others that I have read. It seemed to stick to a very familiar format. There was a considerable amount of jumping back and forth in the timeline of her life, and although I understand why she chose to go this route, at times it confused me and made it difficult to follow the story.<br /><br />Whilst I appreciate that we all must overcome some type of adversity in our lives in order to achieve success, but in my honest opinion, there are some things that just are not worth putting into print. Reliving every detail of one's life in order to show how they came to the decisions they did can not only be unnecessary, but also exhausting when it is laid out in a book.<br /><br />I was also a bit surprised by how religious this book was. I agree with believing in something, regardless of what you call it, but in the end, my opinion was that this book bordered more on a testimonial of faith than a memoir.<br /><br />I applaud her for sharing her world with us all, but I think it could have been handled a little better.<br /><br />If you are a dedicated fan of memoirs, this book might appeal to you. For me, it just wasn't what I had expected or hoped it would be.<br /><br />This review is based on a digital arc provided in exchange for an honest review.",Negative
"There are three main things I learned from this book. 1.) I apparently I do not know nearly as much about art and the artistic process as I thought I did. This author does an excellent job of explaining minute details about art, the industry and just about every aspect of the art world. 2.) What I do know is books and how they are written and whether they make the cut. 3.) Referring to the aforementioned statement on books, this one failed miserably.<br /><br />This book is as good as the title. I do not mean this in a positive light. If you have read the title, then you have essentially read the book. There is no real mystery, a total lack of intrigue and the writing is just bad. I wanted to love this book. I think with an editor who knew what they were doing and took their job seriously, this author would have been saved from the angry ruminations of hundreds of readers like me. This book made me think though, I will give it that. This book made me think about how we judge traditionally published authors VS. Those who have chosen to publish independently. Perhaps the divide is not so great as I once thought.",Negative
"If you are looking for a book that starts out making you want to jump off a roof and ends the same way, this is just the thing. Depressing. That is really the only way to describe this book. This is not coming of age or life lesson learned type material. This is ""there is no way this much crap could happen to one person"" material. I will surmise the plot: woman...unlucky...woman..upset...unlucky, upset woman...end of book. Save yourself the pain.",Negative
"There is no easy way to say this, but I wasn't born with a filter anyway. This book sucks. I couldn't find a single thing to like about it and I gave up half way through. I wasted my time telling myself because this was a BTB novel that it would naturally have to get better as the chapters rolled on. I was so wrong. I wouldn't recommend this if you love this author. Find another one of her books where it actually appears she was the one who wrote it.",Negative
"I really couldn't find a way to support these main characters in their quest to love each other eternally. I just couldn't get past the idea that he used to think of her as a sister and then she became hot and then he had the hots for her. Pardon me, but I want my characters to be strangers or at least not family relations before they take the leap and fall into forever love. This book was a bit on the disturbing side for me. I gave it two stars because the writing was okay even if I hated the plot. Can't recommend this one though.",Negative
"I really love Fern Michaels books and although they mostly tend to have some silly and unbelievable plot points, this one I just couldn't get through. I read the first four chapters and decided I had to move on. This book rambles senselessly for pages without ever getting to the point. I felt this one was wordy and boring. I will try a different Fern novel soon and remind myself why I love her. Not the finest example.",Negative
"I really love dogs. I have four of them and they capture my heart in a way this book didn't. I really thought I would love this as the central focus is about a dog, but it just didn't turn out that way. This book is mostly flat information and description and some whining from the main character about her messed up life. I wanted to love it, but it just wasn't exciting enough to keep my interest. I gave up a little over half way.",Negative
"I will not go into a lengthy diatribe about why I did not enjoy this book. To do so would be to reveal all of the quirks it has and include a lot of spoilers for those who have not read it yet. What I will say is that this is one of those ""Oh come on, no one is going to believe that!"" kind of books. I found myself rolling my eyes, shaking my head and asking myself why I was even bothering. I got 2/3rds of the way through and realized these were moments of my life I was never going to get back. I moved on to another book.",Negative
"After reading the other Kay Scarpetta novels, I was looking forward to this one. Now I'm just disappointed. This book drags on eternally, never makes a point and eventually ends with more questions than answers. I thought even the character that I usually love fell flat this time. I almost think that Patricia Cornwell resented having to write another one of these novels or something. I try to not leave a one star unless I really, really hate a book, but this one is deserving. I can't recommend this book. If you want to read a novel in this series, read one of the older ones.",Negative
"I love Michael Crichton books. I mean, who doesn't right? This book is not up to par at all compared to his other works. I felt like this book had an excellent premise and could have gone the distance. The beginning was very good and I thought it had promise. All of a sudden, when you get about half way through chapter two, you come to realize your error. This book is just cheesy. If I wanted to watch b flicks on the Syfy channel I would be doing that instead of reading a book. It is hard to believe this is out of the same mind that brought us such books as Jurassic Park and Congo. I might have to start reading the book previews before buying if this becomes a pattern. UGH.",Negative
"Okay so I love a good goosebumps book as much as the next person and I usually read these with my children. Not the most advanced and deep form of entertainment for adults, but cute and fun nonetheless. This one stinks. I'm not going to candy coat it. There are great R.L. Stine books out there to be had, and this in certainly not one of them. The story leading up to the big ending is weak and uninteresting and the monster at the end is pathetic. His death will live on in the hall of fame of worst story endings ever. Even my six year old said ""Yeah Right!"" at the end of this one. Bad. Stinkier than JellyJam himself.",Negative
"I really wanted to love this novel. ""The book of Ruth"" is one of my favorite books and I guess although I try not to have preconceived notions about what to expect after loving one book from a certain author, I guess I wasn't fully prepared for the let-down I felt after reading ""When Madeline was Young.""<br /><br />  In my opinion, this book is terribly disjointed and not in any way a fluent read. I got bored during the first chapter which; let's face it, is never a good sign. The characters were flat and ineffectual and I found the voice of the narrator to be dreary. I have met more likable feral cats.<br /><br />  After all the rave reviews I read for this book I was expecting it to be a lot better than it was. This reminded me very much of a poor attempt from a young, inexperienced first-time author. I thought someone more seasoned would have been able to script a more smooth and entertaining novel. This one is not one I feel I can honestly recommend. Perhaps you should check out some of the earlier works by this author.",Negative
"I have stuck with this series and found that it rises and falls like the tides of the ocean. Some of the books were excellent. Some of the books have been mediocre and some of them have been just ugh. This book fell into that last category. I felt that Mrs. Macomber spent too much of her writing space detailing events we had already read about in previous books and giving hints about what the next book was to be, rather than focusing on resolving the issues with the characters in this book. I found the over all story line to be a grave disappointment as much of it centered around events that weren't hardly exciting enough to make the reader continue turning pages. I realize that all good things must eventually come to an end, but I almost feel like they could have left this book out of the series and other than the numbers in the title not matching, no one would have noticed.<br /><br />For the die-hard Debbie fans, I will say this. She has stuck to the formula of everyone ends up happy and without giving away too many details, I think this book is modeled after some of her earlier works in some ways. The pace is slow and careful and she does answer the questions she raises in the last book. Still, I feel she has done this storyline before and it makes me wonder if she was being pressed by her publisher to come up with another book and thus 1022 Evergreen was born.",Negative
"This is definitely meant for someone traveling to Utah from out-of-town, interested in learning where to get interesting food, entertainment, and lots of alcoholic drinks at various bars. It was not what I thought it was going to be. I'm a Utah native and have done -(AKA eaten) more than half of them just by living here, and don't plan on doing the rest of them because they involve drinking some form of alcohol. I don't like how the author pokes fun of and makes fun of Utah and (Mormon) Church members culture and tradition. I'm dissapointed in the book, I had high hopes for it, it is a good idea, but poorly executed. I will say there are a few ideas that look like fun.",Negative
"This book is written by 3 affluent very old white men. Only 1 is a Dr, the other are in REAL ESTATE. I felt like the entire book was very pandering, bordering on condescending. I couldn’t figure out where I had heard this stuff before and then I googled the authors. The oldest (he’s mine 92!!) was Dr. Oz’ consultant on his show. So, this is mostly regurgitated info. The WAY it’s written just really bugged me. It made me feel like my Grandpa was just preaching at me.",Negative
"This book is so slow paced and very predictable, I only got about a quarter way through when it started to really bore me. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the whole thing and only got about three quarters in.  The story line is not very organised and I couldn't keep up with all the characters and their stories. Some of the characters were likable, but some were stereotyped and annoying. If you want to read this book I would recommend it for 15 and above. If you are uncomfortable with cursing and sexual references avoid this book.",Negative
"Not a very talented writer in my opinion. There are several stream of consciousness inserts that are weird and feel forced. I guess more than anything though, it was just a boring book.",Negative
Came broken. Very small.,Negative
"I really like Macomber's stories that have made it into movies on Hallmark Channel. I like the Cedar Cove series (Andie McDowell makes the show). But this book is not at all what I was expecting.<br /><br />First it is the 2nd in a series, but is a stand alone (in other words you don't have to read the first one to understand what's going on). However, the character development is not top notch. While you cn get into the head of a female character, they are not well rounded and there is something about them that doesn't ring alive. The men characters are not vibrant and their flaws are exaggerated. The characters are more predictable than a cloudy summer sky... sure to get rain, just not sure when or how much.<br /><br />The head jumping from character to character is choppy, and the transitions are poor. It makes for a start-skid-jump-stop kind of story flow which is very annoying. I am extraordinarily disappointed at this offering from Macomber. I thought someone who's been published so much would be excellent.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to the Hallmark movies and not read any more from this author.",Negative
"This novel was like ""Waiting for Godot"" except...(and I didn't think this was possible)..worse.<br />the beginning was meandering and rambling<br />the middle was AT BEST stagnant<br />and the end was an abrupt and failed attempt to salvage a boring, unimaginative novel.<br /><br />I read this because The Life of Pi is one of my favorite books. If you liked the creativity and style of that book, save yourself the disappointment. This book was nothing like it.<br /><br />It's sad because instead of writing about getting back on the horse, he should actually do it.",Negative
"The whole premise of this book was so insipid, like the writer was noodling around for a cute idea to write about as she sat on the train to work. And she started writing and wasn't at all sure where to go with it so she tried making the characters intriguing, but they weren't. Many of the voices were so similar you couldn't tell who was speaking except by looking at the very pale gray label at the top of the page. The people she portrayed were really pathetic, totally lacking a raison d'etre in life. I finished the book because I had nothing else to read at the moment.",Negative
"When I saw this book, I was excited. What could have topped off the ULTIMATE PERFECTION that was Book 6? Maybe it would be like book 4? But GOD! I was left tasting bitter disappointment! For the first... I don't even know... 10 pages? Yeah, that seems like it. It was a pretty good book. Then when it got more into the fairy tale part, (Which, I thought would be exciting.) it lost its creativity, only mashing other ideas into a book that has been SO good and ORIGINAL.<br /><br />~Side note: I gave this 2 stars because I liked a few of the different concepts, for example, her friends being characters and the Dorothy and Alice jokes. That's about it. However, it DOES teach you about the roles of characters and what their 'terms' are. Otherwise, 2 stars for me.~<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! I AM ABOUT TO EXPLAIN A DEEP-SPOILER ANALISIS OF THIS BOOK. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE SPOILERS, PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW RIGHT HERE. Thank you. XD<br /><br />The class has been assigned with an essay that tells you to make up your own fairy tale story. Nikki starts thinking and reads the fairy tale book her teacher set out (To get ideas, you know?) for the entire class. In gym class, dodgeball was going on and then Mackenzie (Hollister, if you REALLY want to know her last name. BTW the mean girl of every book.) slammed a dodgeball right in her face, causing our *ahem* 'Protagonist,' to become unconscious and travel into the WORLD OF FAIRY TALES RAINBOWS AND UNICORNS!!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧<br /><br />This book was EXTREMELY random the whole way through, plain, AND BORING AS TYPING THIS REVIEW. XD<br /><br />Anyway, 2.5 out of 10 IGN for me unoriginal, plain, boring, random and besides character moments, nothing characteristic at all and EVERYTHING is perfect for Nikki. She gets Brandon, makes immediate friends, etc. This is unrealistic.<br /><br />Save your money, kids.<br /><br />Don't do drugs.",Negative
"When I saw this book, I was excited. What could top off the greatness that was book 9? But goodness, I was left tasting such bitter disappointment!<br /><br />This book is about Nikki Maxwell and Brandon discovering a Dog with 7 puppies that were dropped off at Fuzzy Friends Animal center. Brandon explains to Nikki that the manager of Fuzzy Friends is not going to accept any more dogs into the shelter until Sunday. This made Nikki and Brandon sad because they knew that if they sent the dogs to another shelter there was a high chance that they would be killed if they were not adopted in time. So the two created a plan. Nikki, Brandon, Chloe, Zoey and the guys were all going to keep them in their houses for 1 day each. The plan went perfectly until Nikki's mom told her she couldn't keep the dogs. Now Nikki and her friends had to hide 7 dogs from her Parents, A mean girl, and an entire school.<br /><br />This entry was very disappointing and bland. The entire book was just the friends running around trying to hide the dogs. The story was very bland and wasn't funny or handled very well. Personally, I didn't like the story and it was plain and boring.<br /><br />Most of all, it wasn't very realistic. Her parents and the school would have noticed easily that there were dogs in the house. But, staying on the plot, Nikki doesn't get caught and succeeds to hide the dog. If you know that the plot isn't going to be realistic, change it. Don't make it unrealistic because you are too lazy to change the plot.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't like it. If you enjoy a book like this, go for it. This book would suit you very well. I also am not a dog person... sooo...",Negative

"I was really disappointed by the author's lack of definition about the American Dream.<br />David speaks in a format to condone everything America has done to Christianity yet, has not fully researched the topic of the early American dream to the present, but presumes his own righteousness in believeing that all of American Christians are ""cultured Athesists"" by definition. He sees Americans as the dirty wealth of the world and that we somehow literally need to give up everything to be a Christian. He makes you believe that by NOT selling all you have, and instead wanting a family with children and a home is somehow selfish, self-centered, and arrogant.<br /><br />David Platt is heavily involved in world missions and his point of view is that all American Christians must be missionaries to the point of martyrdom or, you are not an authentic Christian. He states, and I quote, ""if you think that God called some people to be missionaries, and some are not, you are mistaken. God has called everyone into international missions and to do the great commission and to be a martyr for Christ.<br /><br />I couldn't dissagree more. I believe the Holy Spirit gives urgency and strength to those He appoints to go to world missions. Someone has to work the American dream to support the missions, right??? Didn't people in the New Testament have families and a home? Was that selfish of them, because I didn't see Jesus pointing that out?<br />David goes too deep with what is not cross referenced in the Bible and he plainly is on a hate trip with American materialism up to having running water and needing forgiveness overtones for having electicity. All Christians should be fullfilling the great commission and that includes living the American dream. His definition of the American Dream is materialistic culture but, this is not always the case. Yes, we have nice churches to go to but, not all are self-centered, money swindling churches! In fact, America and her Christian churches give more money to other countries than any other countries in the world in light of the predominately Christian heritage. I think he's absurd in his preaching and far fetched. If you truly read the Bible, you will see through his misleading guilt for being American, living in capitalism, and demoralizing those who choose to stay here and support missions financially. Not every American Christian is materialistic nor, called to be an international missionary martyr. In my opinion, he sounds more like a liberal socialist on the edge of hating America.<br /><br />The guilt he preaches about of being born in America does not come from God. Actually being in America serves as a different way of ministering and being a missionary right within our own country! He never talks about this. He only states one side of the coin.<br /><br />I am a very devout Christian, and I would not pay a penny to hear someone preach the words he is saying to people. Our sacrifices to God is an individual calling, not a gross number of people all doing the same thing. God works in mysterious ways. Perhaps you are leaving mission seeds at work by the Holy Spirit and don't even know it. Who is this author to presume he knows what's more righteous for some in the name of God? David thinks that when you say things like this, you are ""chickening out"" on doing missions and being mislead spiritually. I think he truly is mislead! The American dream is different for eveyone who lives it, and those who do missions in other countries, or someone who works in a hospital to help people, that American dream is between that person and God, not David Platt!",Negative

"As a serious Tolkien fan, I figured this would be interesting.  Sadly, it isn't.  Somehow the humans don't quite come across as real people, and without them the landscape descriptions are rather flat.  The stories also are pretty depressing - mostly about fighting and war and suffering.  Others may like it, but not for me.",Negative

I can see why this fell out of print.  The writing style and the content are very dated.  Kind of wish I hadn't bothered.,Negative
"The tide of gore is rising in this book, and the attention to plot structure is falling.  Ugliness piled on ugliness, for no good reason.",Negative
"The ratio of ugliness in this book is much higher than the first two, and the amount of time spend on psychoanalyzing Ten and his current female companion is excessive.  I wish I'd stopped after book two.",Negative
"Ten hasn't learned a thing in the course of these books, and apparently the authors have run out of patience in crafting actual reasonable plots.  Inventing a previously unknown brother? REALLY?

Someone once said of the kama sutra - position 59 is like 58 but with your fingers crossed.  The same applies to this as so many of these Bhajan based books - thousands of kriyas but they are very similar to each other and no one ever says why THIS one is better than THAT one for the purpose.  If you already have a couple of such compilations you can do without this one,Negative

"I loved The Alienist.  This book I despise.  It is poorly structured, erratically plotted, full of loose ends and random irrelevant story spikes that go nowhere.  The supposed Watson and Holmes characterisations are cartoonish, the dialogue leaden and unimaginative, and the two supposed hooks - Queen Victoria and Supernatural Influences - are both completely bogus, having basically zero to do with the poor attempt at a plot.  If you absolutely have to read it, for goodness' sake save yourself the money and borrow it from your local library.  You'll be returning it soon enough.  This dismal waste of space does not deserve to take up the lives of any more trees.",Negative
"VERY old material, unless this is the very first thing you've ever read along these lines, don't bother.  There is better material all over the place.  A better choice is Richard Ingalese's History of Mind but only get a cheap edition, it's not good enough or current enough to spend a lot of money on.",Negative

"I was so dismayed by this book that, instead of my usual habit of donating it to the library, I donated it in shredded form to the recycle bin.  The author puts forth an opinion that disease ought not to be cured by any medical or naturopathic means but should be suffered through to somehow cleanse the defective organism.  This is outright ridiculous and horribly dangerous.  Avoid at all costs!  I'm all in favor of freedom of speech but this could be harmful to the unwary.",Negative
"Do yourself a favor and borrow this from the library rather than wasting money on it.<br />The quality of writing has deteriorated very badly - partly the constant interpolations of back-story stuff so that people who haven't read the other two books can be catered to, plus the completely idiotic resuscitation of several characters from the past that have no worthwhile part to play in the current story.  Also the illogical &#34;plot structure&#34; that has several key characters doing things that are just plain stupid simply to push them into the next quirk in the unreasonable plot<br /><br />But worst of all is the descent into prurient gratuitous violence.  The prolonged descriptions of torture are stomach churning and disgusting, and the seemingly random attacks of one character upon another make the whole &#34;creature&#34; population seem composed of junk yard dogs.<br /><br />The story moves with the pace and coherence of an aging cable car with bad brakes - jerky, stop and start, spurts of pseudo-action, then digressions.  The dialogue voices are stilted and make essentially no distinction between one character and another.<br /><br />The whole thing is banal, ugly and gratuitous enough that I'm sure Ms Harkness will make a ton of money off of it, and the supposed push to turn this whole thing into a series of movies will be made easier by the comic strip quality of this current volume.  Sadly, what started in the first volume as a fairly well written story with characters that seemed worth developing has deteriorated into something that moves between mediocrity and toxicity.  There is no magic here, and that becomes most apparent in the scenes where magic is supposed to be taking place.  Ms Harkness clearly does not &#34;get it&#34; about the nature of the magical world.",Negative
"If you absolutely have to &#34;read&#34; this, based on bad-accident syndrome, for your wallet's sake pick it up at the public library.  I have seldom come across worse writing - the whole thing comes across as generated by a computer on Ativan.  ZERO character development, dismally bad &#34;plot&#34; development, huge gaping holes in what presents itself as a narrative line, and lays the trail for the inevitable book three so blatantly as to be offensive.  Ms Trussoni has some interesting ideas but no skill at all as a writer, and whoever posed as editor either for this or its predecessor needs to be sent back to school.  Not even engaging enough to be depressing, just BAD.",Negative
"Poorly written, very low quality paper, and the execution of the ideas is really low grade.  The concept is nice, the execution mediocre.",Negative
"Of course I looked into it because of his mentor's recommendation.  but the writing level is puerile, character development neglibible to dreadful (especially the female characters) and basically its energy level never gets off the ground.  All the various creatures and ""races"" come across as gimicky and cardboard, and the story has no substance.<br />I really tried to like it, and really tried to give the writer the benefit of the doubt but basically it came down to an unappealing failed attempt at story telling by someone who demonstrates no grip on the craft and no resonance with the art form.<br /><br />If yo're curious, borrow it from your local library and save your $$$ for something more worth while.  (Don't worry if there's a long ""hold"" list - most likely it will come back to the library pretty fast each time!)",Negative
"Nice idea, quite well researched though clearly mostly from shallow new-agey sources, but not well executed and the writing skills need serious work.<br />Characters are cardboard, very uneven quality of storyline development, and instead of an ending it just kind of stops.  No resolution, no real explanations.  And it's very hard to understand why, if the bad characters live so long, they are still so shallow and stupid.  Not one plausible or REAL character amongst the lot, I'm afraid.<br /><br />FAR too much detailed description of curtains and clothes, and not nearly enough indication that there is anything to the characters at all.  And good LORD, the endless dramatic pauses for lengthy explications - no one would have TIME for that much chit-chat!<br /><br />With all that explication there's next to no real enlightenment as to what the whole angel thing is really about.  And how on earth the protagonist manages to put an ancient musical instrument together in the middle of a fight on the New York subway is completely unclear!<br /><br />Basically this is a fairly promising story that needs a huge amount of work to make it as readable and enjoyable as it should have been.  You won't want to keep it, so give your library some business and borrow the thing.",Negative
Sorry this was not very good - I like GRS Mead on the whole and also like S Hoeller but this book is a complete waste of time.,Negative
"DEFINITELY do not buy ""new"" here as it is much cheaper via the Arica website.  However I concur that the material is radically out of date.  Its sole usefulness is following the trail of what Oscar USED to think about realms, instincts, etc.  Y<br />ou can borrow it from any decent public library system, read it and note the points you care about, which are anyway buried pretty deeply in a text that was clearly taken straight from the lectures and NOT edited for readability.<br />The presentation style and word usage are extremely dated so be prepared to wince a lot.",Negative
"If you're planning to get this book because of the TV series, don't bother - the relationship is very tenuous and not worth either money or time to investigate.<br />I did get this because of the TV series and while the first 100 pages or so were quite good the story got mired down VERY quickly and basically goes nowhere.<br />It becomes very clear that the author has no philosophical skills or really any FEEL for philosophy.  The few more or less moral issues that come up are not examined in any depth and certainly not resolved.  Of course, you would not really EXPECT a sci fi writer to have philosophy chops, but the author would have done better to stick to a more science and thriller theme and left the highbrow stuff alone.<br />The end result is failure on all fronts.  I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather than spending money on it.",Negative

"I’m a graphic designer, I like to learn info through graphics. This book doesn’t do Infographic right. There’s hardly any graphic, just simply colorful texts putting in colored boxes and mashed together, makes it even harder to read compare to a simple .doc document.

&lt;strong>This book lost me&lt;/strong><br /><br />This writer is very good with words but this story was terrible. Esp toward the end. It went everywhere. And someone is held captive for almost a year and they don't have trauma upon release and can go out and eat ice cream like nothing happened? Totally became unbelievable for me two thirds thru and then the last part was awful. Bobby just appears and it takes the writer too much time to explain his showing up and its never fully explained how a nine yr old got to Newark alone bc if he came w Lucinda she would have told Julian right away about Kendall and then he would have done something right off. Frankly the entire Bobby part was dumb and really sadly the part about Julian's marriage was boring. Just a setup for the last bad section of the book. This book could have ended much sooner with a better well thought our ending. A romance novel turned spy novel turned detective novel. Lost me.,Negative

"Fade to Black was entertaining even though it ended abruptly with no closure. Bled White held my interest although not as successfully as Fade. But by Red on the Inside, I was slogging through tedious rehashings of the same hallucinations and alternate-worldish images over and over. I was determined to read the final results. So imagine my anger when even after three books there has been no explanation of what's going on . . . just another cliff. I decided not to jump.",Negative

But when we do sit down to read together, I can't even use the first two sections as learning tools.  My16 month old just wants to skip to the third section where the hidden pictures start<br />.",Negative
David looks like death warmed over.  He is seriously creepy looking and the rest of the art is terrible.  4th graders have more artistic talent.  Nightmare quality artwork right here!<br /><br />But what really bothers me is the theme of this book is intentionally negative.  David is constantly getting in trouble and being yelled at.<br /><br />I don't know how this book ended up in our collection but I threw it in the trash!  It's FAR to creepy to donate!!!,Negative
"This coloring book isn't very ""Big"" like the title claims.  I guess I was expecting it to be bigger (even though Amazon gives the dimensions in the description).  Just keep in mind that it really isn't that much bigger then a standard piece of computer paper (9x11).<br /><br />On a positive note, the paper is of thicker quality and the drawings are very detailed.  So our 2 year old colors these pages completely... unlike other coloring books where he only colors each page for a few moments before wanting to move on to the next page.<br /><br />However, there aren't as many pages to this book as I would expect, especially for the price.  Also, there is only one sticker page... and we blew through the stickers in less than two days.<br /><br />If you're looking for a coloring/sticker book combo, I STRONGLY recommend the ""THOMAS' STICKER EXPRESS (Thomas & Friends) (Super Stickerific) [Paperback]"" by Golden Books (link below).  There are far more pages to color and a ton more stickers.  In my opinion, it is totally worth skipping this coloring book and spending the $3 dollars on the other book.  (At the time of this review, this coloring book was listed at $6.99 where as the other coloring book is listed at $10.39)<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/THOMAS-STICKER-EXPRESS-Friends-Stickerific/dp/0375841261/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358928541&sr=8-1&keywords=thomas+sticker+book",Negative
"Grandma bought this book at a brick and mortar store and I feel like she totally got ripped off.  Not at all reusable like the cover claims.  The stickers are less sticky, so you can reuse them once or twice at best.  But still, 75 stickers for this is still seriously overpriced.  And I especially don't like how many of the stickers are the exact same, over and over again.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a reusable sticker book, search amazon for the Melissa and Doug reusable sticker pad.  Totally awesome and a far better value since it's around the same price.<br /><br />If you want just stickers, search for the ""THOMAS' STICKER EXPRESS (Thomas & Friends) (Super Stickerific) [Paperback]""  with over 700 stickers.  A little bit more, but seriously a good value for the money.  If you don't have a thomsas/train lover, I'm not sure if Golden Book makes any other 700+ sticker books.... but I sure hope so, because this Thomas book is awesome (and I'm super stingy, so if I say $10+ for a coloring book/sticker book, believe me) :-)",Negative

"This novel is certainly light reading and full of cliche phrases that made me laugh. I listened to it on Audible. It was actually fun to listen to when I was ill recently; it was a very good stress-reducer. I would hardly call it good writing. The characters are rather flat, corny, and silly. This is a book for teenagers, or possibly, young adults with limited experience of history or good writing. Obviously, Sarah Woodbury borrowed some ideas from the Outlander series, but she does not write nearly as well as Diana Gabaldon.<br /><br />Okay, I changed this from a one star to two stars, since it is rather fun. Young teens would like this book.",Negative

This book should have been turned over to an Introvert to write or else the author should have, at a bare minimum, collaborated with an Introvert author. Pick up any book written for an Introvert audience by a bona fide Introvert author and you'll find a completely different tone to the book with an abundance of  substance and depth. Not so for this book. I found myself recoiling about half way through the book and completely deflated in energy. Like another 2-star reviewer, I didn't finish reading it, which is rare for me also. This book is going in my recycle pile. Maybe somebody else can benefit from the material to good effect, but for true Introverts, don't waste your time.

"This is clearly intended to be a Christian book, but as such it gives a troubling message. The main character makes decisions throughout the book based on following her heart. Sure, there is some gratuitous praying and hoping that she can follow God's path for her, but when it boils down to it, the book is all about following her heart and belief that since her heart feels something, it must be God's will also. This is analogous to the worldly philosophy, if it feels good, it must be right. Any true student of Christ and the Bible knows that our hearts must be guarded and are deceitful above all things. It it's just not God's will to destroy lives and families, regardless of what your heart tells you, yet this is what the author tells us in her story. It is just creepy and troubling to see study/discussion questions that follow.<br /><br />I believe the writer went to great lengths to provide supporting factors for the main character's decision. Not only did her heart love the Englisher and he made her feel warm and understood, but also she had a dream of her own, apart from her family's dreams, to cook meals and interact with Englishers such as she would in a B and B setting. The other daughter also had aspirations in the English world, and her little son thought it would be interesting to ride on a school bus? Ok. No spark with the brother in law? Ok. Wow. I'm still not buying it.<br /><br />In addition, the writing in this book is just simplistic. There is little development of setting or characters. I had to rely on my own visits in Lancaster County to visualize the story. The dialog is ever so simple and repetitive. I cannot imagine anyone actually speaking this way. The progression of the story doesn't even seem genuine, in that through the whole book the main character denies what she is really thinking and doing, until the very end, yet we are supposed to believe that what she ends up doing is not only right for her, but also God's best will for everyone involved?<br /><br />Honestly the only reason I continued to read it was that I hoped she would make a solid decision at the end and WAIT. Maybe not necessarily marry the brother in law, but just realize she should wait. I'm with another reviewer who said nothing would cause me to separate from my 16 year old daughter. Certainly no man.<br /><br />So, not a great read, although stressful because of the badness of her decisions, and I did finish it in hope of another ending, so in that way it was compelling. But as a Christian read, quite disturbing and probably will contribute to the misleading of one or several readers who are not strong or knowledgeable in their Christian faith.",Negative

I may have been of the lower socioeconomic class, but the young guys I knew and hung out with were fine kids.<br />  The &#34;hit-jobs&#34; later in the novel took the cake.

When I lived in England later in life, I came to know the British and Irish and I can tell you that I met no one who read this kind of trash or COULD write this trash.

But this book was hard for me to get through, so I can’t help but give it an honest review.<br /><br />I think my number one issue with the book is pacing. During the first 25% of the book, I kept thinking “when is something going to happen?” I mean pretty much nothing happens for the first part of the book. Let me sum it up for you. Pietro’s parents died and he had to move in Giovanni, who has a daughter Lucia. Flash 8 years forward, Lucia and Pietro are like secretly in love with each other, but Giovanni is over protective and wouldn’t approve so they never say anything about it to each other. Lucia moves to NYC and Pietro follows her to watch her secretly under orders for her father. That’s it. What was funny to me is that the book felt like it was dragging on, but there were also these moments where I felt like this were happening way to fast. Like Pietro and Lucia finally get together, he kisses her and then two seconds later they are having sex and apparently it’s like the best thing ever (even though Lucia is a virgin, so yeah that was totally not believable).<br /><br />Another big problem for me was Lucia in general. I mean she is a 21 year old woman who basically still needs to ask her father permission to breathe. I think the thing she is most impressed about with herself is that she has been transferring small amount of her fathers money/her trust to a separate bank account that he can’t see. I can’t help but wondering what this heck girl has been doing since high school yeah she’s a dancer, but it seems like all she has been doing is living at her dads house and practicing in the studio he built her. It’s just weird. Also she constantly makes excuses for her dad until one day she arbitrarily decides that she doesn’t care is her dad thinks she is in danger and how dare Pietro want her to be safe. It ends up being like a two day fight. I ended up like completely disliking her by the end of the book, especially the whole ending with Paris (if you read the book you will understand).<br /><br />I wish I had liked this book. It has all the elements in it to make me like it, it’s just not something I enjoyed. I think the only reason I finished the book is because it was shorter then I expected it to be. I think if you have experience with this author, then you might want to give it a try, but for me it was a no go.",Negative
"I was looking for a whole threesome relationship book, up until this point I think I had only heard of a couple of them and people seem to have very polarizing opinions of this theme. So of course, me being me, I had to check out a couple of books with this theme so I could have an opinion on it. This book kept coming up a lot in the forums and on social media for this theme, so I figured it was a good place to start.<br /><br />I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, or what, but this book did not work for me, like on any level. I actually had no problem with the whole one woman being romantically involved with two men, who were also romantically involved together. Absolutely no problem. It was just the story of the whole thing that did not work for me in any way.<br /><br />The beginning was okay, I liked how Kate finds Joe and Sean, and how their first intimate encounter as a threesome played out. I even liked some of one on one time that Kate spends with Sean and Joe. They really had a great kind of dynamic in the beginning of the book, and there was a little bit of conflict/things for them to figure out, and that was okay.<br /><br />And then things kind of went off the rails for me. One of the males in the relationship is, well, kind of immature, and this becomes a big problem. He has this whole kind of mentality that he gets what he wants or he like boycotts everything, it was very two year old tantrum kind of thing. And then when everything comes to a head, he of course gets his way, in a way that almost feels like guilt and not love. I did not buy their love story in any way shape or form. I thought the back half of the book just did not read authentic and made me mad and annoyed. The characters that I liked in the beginning became something I couldn't even enjoy anymore. I also thought the erotic scenes started to get repetitive and didn't really add anything.<br /><br />I know a lot of people love this book, but for me it just did not work. I could see where it would have its audience, but sadly it just wasn't for me.",Negative
"I really like the cover for this book, and I have to admit it did attract me, and made me want to find out more about the actual content of the book. The book blurb wasn't the most intriguing blurb I have ever read before but it had enough of pull for me to want to try it out.<br /><br />Regardless of what I was expecting, this book was not at all my kind of book. To begin it started off kind of bizarrely. It started off with what I assume was suppose to be one part humorous and one part background information that would want the reader to want to know more. I'm not sure it accomplished either. The man it starts out with has built an automaton and this, essentially clone, believes he is superior to the man who built him. He is demanding, short, and arrogant. I think his offhand comments are intended to be humorous, and maybe they would have been if the situation itself hadn't been so confusing.<br /><br />From there it immediately leaves that scene, which is somewhat jarring, and then turns to what appears to be some kind of political power struggle between families who are always vying for power over each other. My first real bone to pick, is the author is constantly introducing new places and people, and they all have completely unpronounced names, which makes it hard to remember who is who. So by the end of the first chapter, I was decently confused as to what was going on and what was the point of it all.<br /><br />The writing style in general was fairly unimaginative, and did nothing to really draw me into what was going on. I wish I could give specific reasons as to what with the writing style was not appealing, all I know is that about a quarter of the way through the book, I really wanted to stop reading.<br /><br />I struggled to find any characters I could really pull for or identify with. Jianna is probably the character who came closest to me liking, but fell short. Jianna is pulled from her sheltered life into a bad situation early on in the book, and in other books where a main character is kidnapped or something similar, I almost always feel myself pulling for that character, this was not the case with Jianna. I mean I felt bad for her, but her reactions were not organic, and because I didn't really believe in the character it was hard for me to want to pull for her or have empathy for her.<br /><br />Perhaps there is an audience for this book, I suppose it leans more towards sci fi than historical fantasy. Honestly it reads more like a political thriller with bizarre magical elements thrown in for kicks. This is not a book for the urban fantasy fan, nor a book for anyone looking for romance.",Negative
"I considered not writing a review of this book. Mostly because it is not my kind of book. But I decided I should write about because books are the only thing that are giving me a reason to write lately. And more over they make me think about things. I picked this book to read because it was a free download. And I made a promise to myself that I would go outside of my comfort zone and try new things. I remember the day I tried out urban fantasy books, and I protested the whole way. Turns out I fell in love with them. Now I can't imagine a world without werewolves and fae and everything else in between. So why not venture out? Maybe there is something out there for me that I never would have thought to give a chance, a book somewhere on a shelf that will stay with me for years to come. So here I go on my journey to find that book.<br /><br />To start this is a period book. The thing about period books is that as an English major and well quite frankly as a history minor I have read pieces of literature from this time, and they sound nothing like this. Although I get the reasoning behind it. I can remember struggling to understand the words on the page before me, and trying to figure out what they were saying in 1775. How the English language evolves over years is amazing to me. So that being said I believe the author did her very best to convey the times while still writing in a dialect that the average person living in 2000's could understand.<br /><br />For me this book contains a lot of God. Almost to much for my liking. It's a personal preference. I understand the need for God in this book, this woman is starting over after one of the most tragic things that could happen to a person have happened to her, both her son and her husband dead within a years time. To rebuild a life after that, to strike out on her own, you need something to hold on to, and I understand that need wholeheartedly. The only thing that bothered me about the continuing mention of God 18 times on every page was Abby was on a journey to find herself, to become herself, and instead she spends so much time focusing on what God wants, and forgets to listen to her wants and needs.<br /><br />Beth is really the only person I found moving throughout the book. She is a young girl who has literally turned into a bitter angry girl by following her fathers example. She tries so hard to be hard, to be like her father, that she knows no other way to be. The journey that she and Abby take together, in showing Beth that it is okay to be a girl, to want to be happy is okay, it's moving to see.<br /><br />I found the last couple of chapters very rushed. The sudden reappearance and acceptance of Conner's son felt unnatural. The then sudden return of the supposed dead wife, Sally, is the most forced, surreal, part of the book. In all of like a chapter she arrives, throws everything into disarray, and then dies. And then oh my gosh, Abby and Conner and wed and live happily ever after. All this long buildup to only have this sudden sequence of events happen is just weird.<br /><br />I also felt that the arrival of Hannah was unnecessary, like an attempt by the author to give the other characters in the book some reason to interact with the main characters. And as a way to show Abby has some kind of sway over Conner. Although it should be noted this is a series of books, and I think Hannah ends up being one of the ""brides"" in the course of the series, so maybe that is why she was introduced, either way I don't feel like she made any contribution to the story of Abby.<br /><br />I will say that it was able to keep my attention, I didn't hate it. I didn't like it. But this book is not for me. I can see the appeal for other people though (that is until the last couple of chapters where the entire pace of the book changes). I will not be continuing with the series, but I do enjoy a free book.",Negative
"This is the first Coben book I've read, and I think I may have started with the wrong one. These are the least sympathetic characters have ever encountered in a whodunit novel. The detective is a slash and burn TV tabloid reporter, so right there she needs a huge redemptive arc before anything even happens lol. I also tried and failed to care about out of work Wall Street guys,privileged suburban kids playing lacrosse - I'd say a good 90% of the characters. I'm only about halfway through, and I'm wondering whether I should knuckle down and finish, start a different Coben novel, or just move on to a different author. My favorites are the old noir novels and for contemporary my favorite is Michael Connelly. I wish he could put out a new book every week lol.",Negative

"Man I hate to thrash somebody's book, but after dusting this thing off today to see whether I could get anything new out of it, I feel duty bound to save others from the frustration I experienced.<br /><br />I got a bachelor's degree for guitar performance, and I have played in rock, blues, country, dance, variety, etc band since I was a kid. I have always felt like I have the right kind of mind for improvisation - I improvise well in those other genres - but I never got bit hard to make a serious study of jazz about 2 years ago. This book was the only book I bought to supplement transcription as my tutor.<br /><br />So - yeah, first mistake right there. If you want to avoid my bad experience, be smart and buy a bookshelf's worth of books.<br /><br />Now that I am off the ground as a jazz improviser (tho I wouldn't say good by any broad set of criteria - give me a decade to work on good), I can say that this book seems mislabeled.<br /><br />I think the ideas in the book are novel and informative, especially for a composer who wanted to analyze jazz solos and make sense out of them - maybe develop a vocabulary of motives and develop them in a familiar classical composition process - but I don't see this a great tool for the woodshed in its current form.<br /><br />For a new edition, I would like to see less - none, in fact - of the totally abstract permutation stuff like intervals on p19, and much more of the cookbook type stuff starting on p139.<br /><br />I now understand where this book was coming from, but I simply didn't benefit much from it.",Negative
"I bought this book for myself before Christmas, thinking about trying out the Paleo diet this year. The book is heavy and has many photos, recipes, etc.<br /><br />In fact, it has TOO MUCH STUFF.

Overload is bad news because I just want to skip all the excessive text and can we just get to the dadgum recipes?!<br /><br />Also, I am not really concerned about her family. Her kids are cute, sure, but so what? It's worse than being pummeled with photos of my own family babies. Enough already!<br /><br />I returned it and got a copy of THE CASE AGAINST SUGAR.",Negative
"I received Terry McMillan’s novel, I Almost Forgot About You, as an Early Reviewer pick from Library Thing.<br />I just finished Terry McMillan’s novel, I Almost Forgot About You, and I am so glad that’s over. I give it 2/5 stars. The writing was wooden and clichéd. In fact, she said over and over throughout the novel “you can’t make this stuff up” or “this isn’t a movie” and annoying things like that as a wink to the reader that “yes I know this is clichéd but shrug.” The characters showed no development or growth whatsoever. Perhaps that’s the difference between literary fiction and mainstrean fiction: clichéd, predictable writing without any development. This is definitely mainstream fiction, where the author knows what they want to do and populates the story with character types instead of complex characters.<br />The main plot is pretty typical, I think. Middle-aged Georgia, an optometrist living in San Francisco, finds out that one of her early college lovers has died and it makes her reflective and question a lot of things in her life. So she decides to go on a quest to look up all the men that touched her life and see how they’re doing and let them know what they meant to her and how they helped shape who she is today. This is a pretty corny premise, but had it been handled the right way, it could’ve been a great novel with literary and mainstream appeal. So the rest of the book is her on this quest and trying to figure out what to do with the rest of her life. Georgia chose the safe road all her life and frankly, now she’s bored.<br />In some ways, this book is a classic romance with a completely implausible ending. If you’re looking for a lite, occasionally funny beach read with a fairy tale ending, then this is the book for you.<br />It was not, however, the book for me. I have to say I’m glad it’s over.  Georgia’s family is meddlesome, nosey, codependent to the hilt, and has little respect for other people’s boundaries. Boundaries simply will not be tolerated in her family, no matter what the topic. What a bunch of busy bodies. And what’s with calling all the females “hussy”? Even the child gets called a hussy. That is one step up from “bitch” and a couple of other ugly words that women often use to address each other. Not evolved at all.<br />The book’s one saving grace is the recognition that middle age is not the end of life, a message our youth-obsessed culture desperately needs now that the majority of the population is firmly in middle age.<br />Things worked out for Georgia, but keep in mind that this stuff is totally made up and may even turn into a movie. I Almost Forgot About You? I can’t wait to forget about you. Please pass me another classic.",Negative
"I read this book because of some very good Amazon reviews and because it was a novel dealing with a little understood and covered area of the second world war that has always intrigued me.

There is no list of companies to avoid - and one paragraph about synthetic vitamins in general.  Misleading come-on to buy the book?  Otherwise, the info in the book is what you would expect.  To his credit, I did not know he ran a supplement store of his own label (which are super expensive) so the book does not offer a way to order his stuff.

Maud is a murderer - a very clever one, but capable of destroying anyone who stands in her way.  And she always gets away with it.  The stories are translated from the Swedish - and evidently Maud is a popular figure in Sweden.  Described by The NY Times Book Review as “delicious”,  I now have serious doubts about the Review.",Negative
"Yes, it is gripping - and, yes, it is well written - but could I find a character that I liked?  Sorry, I get turned off by a mother who screams the f-word at her 7 year old child - no matter what that child may be up to.  And a father - who is molded to be the perfect husband and father - a supportive, loving, romantic husband, and a piece of jello around his obviously mentally-challenged daughter who is able to manipulate him with ease.  And, the daughter, whom any reader will accurately diagnose as deeply troubled and dangerous from the outset.  Reading this novel, is akin to waiting to observe a train wreck you know will happen.<br />The daughter, Hanna, is seven and she does not speak a word, except the occasional “nasty” to her mother - which her father never hears.  She must have been exhibiting troubling behavior from a very early age - and it is a bit unbelievable that these parents have allowed this to escalate as long as they have - without the serious intervention of medical professionals.  Sending her to school really blows the mind, but these parents try it time after time.<br />So, as much as the pages turned, the mind turned as well, wondering if the author should have done a bit more research on dangerous child behavior and come up with a more believable set of circumstances and solutions.  If this was to be a thriller showcasing  parental problems with childhood mental illness, we didn’t need Crohn’s Disease or architecturally green design.<br />Yes, I felt the ending was setting me up for a sequel - giving Hanna another shot at destroying her mother.  I think I’ll sit that one out!",Negative
"Unless you are delighted  “being seized by irrepressible prolixity”, and know what that means, give this novel a pass.  I was attracted to the story, as, for me, it conjured up a vision of the historic Algonquin Hotel Dorothy Parker Group - that gathering of famous writers, who drank and compared notes on their writings.  This might have been a modern day re-creation of that mythical setting.  Add to that, a recent opportunity I had to spend a magical evening in one of downtown Manhattan’s most prestigious eons-old private clubs, which left me still able to see the heavily carved, moldings, cornices and furniture, and feel the comfort of thick Persian rugs under my feet.  So, with that background of knowledge I began to read.<br /><br />The plot has been divulged by other reviewers, so I’ll spare you the repetition.  I was disappointed to find a timid twenty-some-year old, Ava, who had been given a great environment in which to write her first novel, throw it all away at the twitch of her friend, Stephanie’s finger.  Stephanie takes over, turning what could have been a worthy literary endeavor (and been loved by the residents of the Lazarus Club) into a slimy, modern day discotheque.  Cheap wine, loud music, - more bodies of every ilk crowding the facilities - with some poor literary notable reciting poetry into faulty sound equipment.  And the Lazarus members having a fit.<br /><br />What makes a story sing and grab our interest is usually some identity or at least fascination with the characters, action that is pulling us along, and that famous “arc” - that almost musical wave that hits a crescendo and then settles onto a comfortable or sometimes uncomfortable shore.  The point is - you’ve taken a trip and now you’re home.  The characters were fascinating - one for being off the rails, and the other for an interesting combination of timidity, fear and weakness.  Neither was likable.  The plot unfolded and flopped time after time, and I followed it just to see what would go wrong next.  And, the “arc” - what “arc”?<br /><br />The author definitely can write  - with irrepressible prolixity - if you enjoy reading big words.  I may have missed the boat on this one - maybe there’s some sort of hidden message I’m missing and this novel is literary genius.  I just wonder what those real literary geniuses would have thought of this, as they sat and sipped at the Algonquin ‘lo those many years ago.",Negative
"First, I will say that writing a book is an important accomplishment in itself, and anyone who does it, deserves stars for that alone.  This, unfortunately, is a very poorly written novel, and the author is not totally to blame.  If editors were involved, they let her down - or perhaps they don't know what good writing is.  Some reviews refer to the &#34;writing style&#34;.  This is not a style the author will want to carry on through any future writings.  And, she may want to find a truly professional editor.<br /><br />After reading several pages of the first chapter, I brought out my yellow marker, thinking that my writing workshop could benefit from some writing examples of what not to do.  By the end of Chapter One, my pages were damp and a sea of yellow.  I quit at that point, as the writing was too frustrating to go any farther.  Why did I buy this book?  Here, I learned a serious lesson myself.  I judged the book by the cover and the number of good reviews.  The cover was intriguing and the number of five star reviews was impressive.  Now, I am having a difficult time understanding those good reviews.<br /><br />Historical fiction is my favorite read, and those who wrote the 5 star reviews should read some really good novels in that genre.  Very quickly they will be able to see a great difference.  I suggest The Nightengale and the Summer Before the War - two elegantly written novels.<br /><br />I won't be finishing this book, but I will hang on to it.  It's an example of a good marketing effort by someone.  The book kept popping up whenever I browsed historical fiction, and I fell for that cover!",Negative
"This novel was a disappointment.  Well-written but with a rambling plot, it moved at a snail's pace that caused this reader to stop and ask, &#34;Where is this thing going and why is it taking so long - and will it be worth it to keep reading&#34;?  The characters are difficult to relate to - and actually compel the reader to suspend belief a number of times.  Martha and her erratic sister, Del, get away with an unbelievable act early on -which probably would become a non-issue if self-defense were used as a defense.  But, instead of handling the situation as they should - well, you'll have to read the scenario for yourself.<br /><br />The two sisters spend the next years, and some 200 pages, just living their unattractive lives - and all this leads up to another unbelievable and totally unnecessary act.  This one comes back on them like a boomerang - and the good (?) sister, Martha, finally deals with it as you and I might.  Enter Providence to save the day.  Meanwhile, the unpredictable sister has to lie in the bed she chose, abandons a child, and then leaves the scene.  The End.  I hope the fact that the flakey sister is left swinging in a hammock somewhere doesn't mean that this author plans to write a continuing story of these two individuals.  There was hardly enough &#34;meat&#34; on them to fill this novel's 304 pages.<br /><br />This author writes well.  What's lacking here is a plot that has direction, movement and purpose - and characters we will take the time to love or hate.  To wind it up, I coudn't see the relevance of the title, as clairvoyance had hardly anything to do with the story - other than a token sighting of a ghost sprinkled in from time to time.",Negative

"The Haunted Mine by Carrie Bates unfortunately has an amateurish feel to it. It felt like a student had a school assignment to come up with a Haunted story. It sadly lacked depth and had hardly any character development. It was like some kid retelling a story he or she once heard. It was on the shorter side and didn't take much time to read.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was also pretty predictable with no real twists. Adam was nice but very one dimensional. You don't really get to know him as a person at all and the only other people you hear something about are Roy and Bill, Kathy and Sarah, and none are really drained out any real depth.<br /><br />This is sadly not even a real Haunted story since those should be at least a little scary, which you're is not, not even close.

"I'm a sucker for mystery books taking place in New England, not to mention mysteries taking place in bookstores. I need to get suckered in less easily. This book makes me want to throw things. I'm not sure if it's the book or up.<br /><br />Our protagonist Addison ""Addie"" Greyborne previously worked with rare books at the Boston Public Library. When a great aunt she doesn't even remember leaves her the old family home in the small New England town of Greyborne Harbor and a great deal of money, Addie takes the opportunity to move there and open her own rare book store. The day she opens the store someone in a dark car tries to run her down, then someone tries to break into her store, and then while she and her new friend Serena (owner of the cute tea shop next door, SerenaTEA [eyeroll]) are cleaning up a mess at the back of the store, someone breaks into the front and creates a mess, but just makes off with a cheap copy of ALICE IN WONDERLAND.<br /><br />This is all in the first chapter. In the next 250 pages, the dark car tries to get her several more times and is seen hanging around her home, someone breaks into her home, someone steals her keys, etc. We also find out that a year earlier Addie lost her fiance David in a home invasion, six months earlier her father died near the Harbor in a terrible car crash, and then she was notified her aunt passed away. For most of the book she is either racing to open her store then back to her house where it takes her ages to get an alarm system installed to the police station or somebody's trying to get her or into the places she owns...she finally decides she needs an assistant and hires the first person she interviews. (Ironically, the new employee is the daughter of a fellow businessperson on the street, a sour woman named Martha who hates Addie on sight and gets together with a bunch of other Harbor businesspeople to force her to leave town because...well, we don't know why—check next paragraph.) Oh, and then one of the businesspeople is killed and Serena gets accused of the murder, and...)<br /><br />Where do I start? Serena helps Addie clean up an inadvertent mess and suddenly they are besties. Serena's brother Marc is the chief of police, and he and Addie meet eyes and suddenly it's romantic attraction 101. Next thing you know they keep running into each other; no wonder the other businesspeople are all atwitter. I'm shy, but Addie doesn't seem to have that problem, so why in heaven's name doesn't she march up to Martha and ask her, civilly, why all the hate? Apparently someone's been spreading rumors that Addie moved to Greyborne Harbor to escape prosecution on criminal activities in Boston, but even when that is squelched everyone in town hates her and Marc and Serena explain this is because they are jealous of Addie being a Greyborne. Wow, this sounds like a jolly little town. Also, at the time the book opens Addie has been in town a month, remodeling and setting up the store. Do you mean to tell me that at no time has she found a moment to talk to anyone in town, make some friends, go to the local coffee shop, or even notice the tea store next door? She had to eat; didn't she even go grocery shopping? Really?<br /><br />So you've followed my narration about all the things that happened to Addie: the almost-car accidents, the break-ins at the store and at the house, the other threats to her life, right? So finally she gets the alarm system installed in her house! And what does this ridiculous woman do? She leaves the door open and the alarm off because she's expecting Serena for tea. Seriously? Seriously? In one chapter she wonders if Marc thinks she's a dingbat. Well, I for one, lady, can tell you you are.<br /><br />(Also, to the publisher and the writer: the name of the book is ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND. No book expert like Addie would call it just plain ""Alice in Wonderland"" [the title which is not even italicized in the book either time it's mentioned]. The original copy mentioned in this book would have been entitled ALICE'S ADVENTURES UNDERGROUND.)<br /><br />Please. Find a better book. Even Dr. Seuss created more saavy characters.",Negative
There are too many pictures and too much prattling on. The formatting is super goofy. Recipes take up 3 or more pages! It just makes it impossible to follow a simple recipe.

The crime? Accidentally knocking over a chalice. Not on purpose, not in malice, by accident! So he cruelly kicked them out, but then to add the racist cherry on top, called the police.

"I bought this book for my 8 yr-old step-grandson for Christmas. I read the reviews and thought that since he loves cats and adventure stories this would be perfect for him. However, he gets in trouble at school for using phrases that he picks up that sound violent. This is NOT the book for him. The graphic nature in which the death of the coyote villain is planned and described is not suitable for children, ESPECIALLY not ones that are troubled. The coyote is definitely horrible, but I’m not sure that the way it plays out in the book is the best example for impressionable kiddos. My grandson’s parents have to be so careful as to what they expose him too and this book was such a mistake on my part. Going forward, I’m going to read everything first before I just hand him something based off of Amazon reviews. I may be a lone voice on this book, but if you don’t want to offer your children a smug, know-it-all, obnoxious, and unlikeable role model who takes a vigilante approach to whatever ill is encountered, then this book isn’t for you either. Some examples...<br />Pg. 56 “ … I will have to destroy Snarl on my own, and Max will most likely be lost. But I am certain of one thing: Snarl’s head will roll.”<br />Pg. 136 “I hear the thud of metal hitting flesh, and a yelp is followed by silence. Snarl is on the ground at the entrance of the garage, and the garage door is smashed into his skull.”<br />Pg. 137 “Blood oozes from Snarl’s skull underneath the garage door. Snarl’s corpse lies in defeat.”",Negative
I am a chef that is always looking for plating ideas techniques and thought by the cover that it may do that.

Very nice idea though.,Negative
"The 1 star is not for the actual book, which I'd rate at 5 stars. This low rating is for the lousy organization of the mp3 files and for the garbage ware on the CDs. There's six stories in this book but the files are just numbered 1-68 without any apparent way of identifying the location of a particular story. I clicked on a file titled CONTENTSDB hoping to find a table of contents. What I got was a screen I could not close that tried to forcibly change both my default browser and my default search engine. No, in this day and age I do not want to use Internet Explorer as a web browser. No, I do not want Bing as a search engine. Both are worthless in my opinion and I despise garbage ware that tries to forcibly inject trash on my machine. To close that unclosable screen I had to turn off my computer and restart it.

"Allison's sister wants to have a breast augmentation before her wedding (a surprise for her future husband). What else to do but switch lives with her twin for a few days while she recovers without her fiancé knowing? After all, Allison and Ann are identical twins, and couldn't be more different. So imagine how Allison feels when she has to leave her life as a mild mannered scientist to be her sister, a free spirited redheaded beauty. She never expected a harmless prank to lead to complications for both of them. Determined to claim the love of his life, Spencer Raft, is willing to end a long friendship with his bestfriend to have what he wants (Ann).  Confused (about what she wants) and conflicted (about ruining her sister's plans), Allison yearns  to tell Spencer the truth, that it is not Ann he has been dealing with but her sister. Finally, forced to reveal the truth, Allison can't wait to see if Spencer's truly desires her or the image she has created.<br /><br />Although there were times that the story was a little corny and dated (she's a virgin and he's a man willing to deflower her...), Thursdays Child was a quick and easy read. And while there were times that I didn't always care for Spencer's attitude, or the huge mystery behind his ""career"" (that once revealed was stupid), I didn't have to think real hard and was slightly entertained.",Negative
"Hailey Dean turned to prosecution following the murder of her fiancé. Coming to work for the District Attorney's Office, in Atlanta, she discovers that someone is preying on prostitutes, killing them and leaving their lifeless bodies scattered around the City. Following various clues, and ""hitting the streets"" with her trusted Investigator, Hailey goes where others fear (visiting those scary areas of Atlanta) to find the truth, as well as solve a crime virtually invisible to law enforcement. Once the suspect is identified (Clint Burrell Cruise), arrested and on trial for murder, Hailey is able to secure a conviction. Immediately following the trial and an attack by the defendant, Hailey quits and moves to New York to become a therapist. With prosecution in her past, and therapy in her future, she tries to think of nothing but her new colorful clients until they start showing up dead. Meanwhile there are tons of other storylines and interesting characters. Among them, a crazed chef killer, a drunken Georgia State Supreme Court Judge, a deceitful politician, an arrogant defense attorney, and a zealous preservationist. Regardless, all of these storylines had potential, and with some work would have been a great story, but for the fact that the story became unrealistic, confusing and lost me a couple of times. Finally, after 2/3's of the way thru, I realized that I wasn't invested in the story and lost interest.  I didn't care how it would end.<br /><br />I selected this book for several reasons. First, Nancy Grace use to be a prosecutor in my office and I know that she had the reputation of vigorously prosecuting defendants. She was considered effective and efficient in the courtroom.  Second, I thought that I would recognize certain people that she was describing by their descriptions (I even thought I knew the defense attorney she described). Third, she is very active and gives back to the kids in the community (participating in Legal Lives etc). So while I should have loved this book, I didn't.  My biggest criticism (and it may be because I know how things work), was that some of the stuff was a tad bit unrealistic. Although we (the District Attorney's Office) respond to some crime scenes, we are not going out investigating the crime from the ground up. An investigation (at least identifying the suspect and making the arrest) is done by the Law Enforcement Agency. I should say that I worked in Atlanta Homicide for years and know what I am saying is a fact. The police investigate while the District Attorney's Office prosecutes. So Hailey, going to the bars, locating the witness, and identifying the suspect is a bit of a stretch. Yes, the police department may have come to her and asked if they have enough to make an arrest, but I am not sure that Hailey would have figured out by reviewing files, that a bunch of cases were related. I would think that that was something the police would have eventually figured out (they have Crime Analysts). And it was even more ""stretchy"" that Hailey would have figured out that the Medical Examiner's Office missed crucial evidence that only she figured out. So ok, maybe I am penalizing her because I have some knowledge of the system that some wouldn't, but that is what blew it for me. So while this book had tons of potential, I think it failed in that it didn't hold my attention. So maybe in a few days I will pick it up and give it another chance, but right now, I am putting it back on the shelf.",Negative
"I really wanted to give this one a try, but where there was potential, this novel failed. I hate to say it, but while I thought the premise was extremely creative...just imagine the story behind a charm bracelet and it's charms, the writing (different authors) fell flat. I really wanted to finish this book..and had to recheck it out of the library several times before I could finish it. Maybe the problem was that there were different authors, and not just one author with a vision. While this works with other authors, like those that collaborated on the Naked Came the Manatee novel, it didn't for these. I would recommend that if you are so moved to read it, make sure you get it from your local library.",Negative
"It wasn't that I thought that this was the absolute worse book that I have ever written, but I think it was lacking something. It could have been that there was great build-up to a showdown, that was really anticlimatic at best.<br /><br />Vicki, is a waitress (or server I think they prefer to be called) at a local diner, and notices a mysterious stranger who visits regularly, but doesn't eat, or come out during the day (hint). Meanwhile, there is a serial killer out there hunting red heads (Vicki is one)and leaving them drained of blood. Who could the killer be, the handsome stranger that she has seen leave the diner with two of the victims.<br /><br />Antonio, the mysterious yet handsome stranger, decides that he will warn all red heads of the perils of inviting a stranger into their homes. And yet they still are dying at alarming rates. His only annoying trait to me what his constance references to Vicki as either ""Sweeting"", ""Sweet"" or ""Sweetness"". I kept thinking, to be so ruggedly suave and old, shouldn't he say things that were more modern and endearing?<br /><br />The book has the normal stuff found in vampire books, a ghost, a vampire hunter, some humans who know of the vampires existence and a really, really bad guy. What little that the story had that was different, was so buried in such stupidness that you really didn't appreciate it. Do I regret reading it? Not really, I was able to read it in two days and although I probably won't remember this novel this time next year I was slightly entertained.",Negative
"I have to admit that I am a harsh critic, and that is why I gave this author another chance. I read Incubus dreams, which sucked....and everyone that I know who is a fan said ""give her another try she is terrific"". So, I picked ""A Stroke of Midnight"" because I really didn't think that I could stomach another Anita Blake novel, and picked this one because it was dealing with Fairies, something that I thought would be interesting. I WAS WRONG. Hamilton needs to get away from the sex just for the sake of having sex, while trying to rationalize that it is for the good of the country....Sithen...Unseelie...Seelie...Courts, whatever. The novel had a LITTLE promise at the beginning, a murder myster and then spiraled into a lot of nothing.....there were chapters and chapters of nothing....this person crying, dying, killing, having meaningless sex, talking about nothing...guards who love...and all want to get her pregnant to become King, understanding that they must share...a Queen who is psycho....Goblins, Fairies, Dragonfly-like creatures....some more stupid stuff....time stands still and I AM STILL WAITING FOR THIS MADNESS TO END. I still don't see the point. And the only reason that I am even giving this a 1 is because Hamilton took the effort to get it published. But finally I can say that I will never read another Hamilton novel again. One time shame on you....the second one, shame on me....I can't give another of her novels a chance because isn't three strikes you're out.<br /><br />To summarize.....Murder + Princess + sex + psycho Queen + Psycho cousin + crying/sexy guards + no real plot to think of = a HORRIBLE book.",Negative

"After reading so many good reviews, plus seeing that this book was on the NYT best books list for 2021 I was shocked at how bad it is. The premise is great - boys on their own on a driving adventure back in the day. Where to start? Unrealistic dialog plus the excessive repetition of names in the dialog. ""How are you Billy?"" ""I'm fine, Duchess."" ""Have you eaten dinner Billy?"" ""Yes, Duchess."" ""Are you going to California Billy?"" ""yes, Duchess, we're going to California."" Ad nauseum. Stupidity of characters.

Just a litany of cruelty, manipulation, child and animal abuse. It left me depressed and wondering why I stuck with it to the end.

If you look at this map, you would think that you can get to the Gulf from Lake Lanier north of Atlanta. That is not true. I wonder how many other rivers depicted on here are not navigable. One of the main reasons I got this was because it showed so many side trips from the great loop. But they are no good if I can’t actually rely on them to be usable.

"This book was a real struggle to get through and I'm about 80% of the way through and I just can't keep reading this... I'll also admit that the last hundred pages or so I've been skimming at best.<br /><br />This is the story of Cat and Francis. But we start with Cat and Patrick. Cat is betrothed to Patrick from when she was a child, the book starts with her marrying Patrick. He claims he loves her, she fights to retain ownership of some property and money her grandmother left her. The marriage ends up being a happy one, but she wants to travel... so Patrick takes her to London, she gets a taste for court life and wants to go to the Scottish Court as soon as the King is older. So fast forward, we're at the Scottish Court and the King wants Cat. He devises a way to get Patrick out of the castle and he propositions her - he's the King so of course she gives him what she wants with the promise that he keeps it between them. And in an effort to extract future revenge from the King, she becomes everything he wants in bed, because when he can no longer have her, he'll always want her. Yes, really - that was her logic.<br /><br />As retarded as that line of thinking is....it worked. The King keeps wanting her. He keeps finding ways to send Cat's husband off, he keeps bedding her. At one point Patrick returns to find her with the King and he flips out. So the King and him go to the next room for a drink and return to rape Cat through the night...yes both of them. They were drunk if it makes a difference and Patrick was very remorseful later.<br /><br />Cat runs away to her only friend, Francis (who is married, living separately). Francis can't believe his good fortune because he's loved her since he's known her. They hook up. Keep in mind this is about 40% through the book and 10 years from when we first started. At this point Cat is a mother of 6.<br /><br />Cat wants a divorce. Patrick, since he's so remorseful, but still hoping to win her back, agrees to give her a divorce after he meets with her (he's been searching for her since she ran away and has no idea she's hooked up with Francis). Anyways, Patrick agrees to a divorce only to have the King stop it. The King goes on to threaten the ruin of Francis and Patrick's entire family if Cat doesn't return to Patrick, so the King can then take her again. Keep in mind Patrick and her have kids, so she doesn't want the ruin of his family. The King strips Francis of his property, he runs to Europe because now the King is after him. Cat returns to Patrick.<br /><br />Knowing that Patrick is ok with her seeing Francis, she runs off once again to see Francis before he leaves for Europe. She then goes back to Patrick. Years later he goes on a journey and dies. The King tells her she has 6 months to mourn before she's expected back and court and she will outright act as his mistress. Cat runs away again, this time to Francis in Italy. But before she gets there she stops in France, has a run in with the French King where she is again forced to perform. Though she thanks him because she is able to feel something with him and she thought that was lost to her. So she makes it to Francis in Italy, now instead of a jealous and vindictive Scottish monarch we're dealing with Francis' jealous lover. The lover organizes a raid while Francis is away and Cat is captured, taken aboard a ship to Turkey, and sold to a harem... The guy she's sold too is totally enamored with her and feels if she's given a coveted position as wife she'll be more responsive to him....so she converts to islam and becomes a 2nd wife. Oh did I mention when she was in Italy her and Francis finally married? At this point I'm seriously skimming through pages.... there is some relation between her and her newest husband because of her grandmother who was also abducted, sold to a harem, and made into a wife (author has some other book on this). Anyways I know Francis is trying to get her back, but I just CAN'T CONTINUE reading this crap.<br /><br />Sorry if my words are harsh, but come on! Where else can this story possibly go? I knew picking this up it was Beatrice Small so expected some antiquated language, which was annoying.. expected some ""bodice ripper"" type scenes, which were not worth the paper they were written on... expected historical court life and intrigue, but it was blah! This is a romance novel for gods sake... I picked it up bc I wanted a HEA, but in the end after seeing this story spiral through 15 years or so I just can't finish it.<br /><br />I've heard other people say Cat was a strong character... no, in my opinion she wasn't. She was stupid. Before marrying Patrick she ran away from him twice, the first time over a stupid lie by her cousin. The second time over a comment about her being a broodmare. When he finally finds her, she's prepared to let their child be born a bastard until Patrick succumbs and gives her back ownership of her property and investment account. She redeemed herself in my opinion when she grew up, joined the Scottish Court, was known as the ""virtuous countess"" because she never strayed from Patrick. Forced by the King or not, you don't WORK to make him want you so that that can later be your revenge.<br /><br />In this story Cat had multiple lovers (Patrick/Husband, King of Scotland/Lover, Francis/Lover, King of France/Lover, Francis/Husband, Turkish Guy/Lover/Husband). I say Lover though in some cases there was pressure.<br /><br />Patrick had Cat and another lover who he had a child with that Cat knew about. Francis had a wife which he divorced, Cat, and another lover.<br /><br />Sorry this is so long, there is just so much happening in this book.... All the while you don't care about anything going on. Take for example the scene where the King and Patrick rape Cat throughout the night. This was a major turning point and was the reason Cat ran to Francis. I didn't care. I felt nothing for the character and did not care what happened to her. Harsh, I know. For me to read a scene like this, even if it wasn't graphic, and not care??? That's pretty much when I lost interest in the book.",Negative

"I can't believe how terrible this book was! The characters from top to bottom are total cliches. Think of any stereotype one may associate with the state of Texas and you will undoubtedly find it here. The characters come across as caricatures  of people; the MC in particular, with his next to super Ranger bad-assedness, is an obnoxious jerk. He's irresistibly handsome, an outstanding singer/guitarist, has catlike reflexes, and is only slightly slower than the fastest gunman in the world EVER who just so happened to train him. All the ladies love him almost as much as he loves himself, although he's only able to grace one of these spectacular beauties with his awesome manliness at a time. I figured out the killer not far into the book; the few efforts to lead readers down false trails are pretty lackluster. After everything is said and done, I'm left wondering what in the world happened to JP's great stories? I'm actually embarrassed FOR him! I'm even more embarrassed for the dedicated, hardworking men and women of the Texas Rangers who must be mortified to find themselves even loosely associated with this silly pap! The one positive that I can say about the whole experience is that I didn't buy it. I waited FOREVER to borrow a copy from my library, and can wholeheartedly state that it wasn't worth the wait.

The most entertaining part of the deal for me is speculating on who these people are that give it five stars and how abysmally low their expectations in a book must be. Back to my cavern of grief.",Negative

"What a boring book.  I was expecting to have some really great ideas to help have a low budget yet still appealing Christmas.  Instead I got what seemed to me to be a half hearted attempt to make a so-called environmentally better Christmas by doing things that made Christmas feel destitute, colorless, and barren.<br /><br />The overall appeal of the crafts was unimaginative, unappealing, and quite honestly, if it came to me having absolutely nothing and it was my only option to celebrate Christmas, I might do one or two, but for the most part, I would take out crayon remnant and color pretty pictures to hang around instead.<br /><br />The recipes were also very ho hum, and I was very disappointed in this book.  Just because you are having a low budget, low wasteful Christmas does not mean that it has to look like destitution.  I really wanted to love this book, but it completely turned me off.",Negative
"Okay, I stopped here and took a quick look at the reviews written on this book- PAINT RED HOT LANDSCAPES THAT SELL by Mike SVOB.<br />After reading the glowing 5star reviews on this book, I seriously stopped and scratched my head.  Could these reviews be talking about the SAME BOOK that I have?<br />I ran and got my book again just to be sure.<br />Yes.  It is the very same book.<br />Hmmm.<br />Well, in short, I can not stand this book.  I have a myriad of various art books and myself am an artist who loves brilliant color and interesting composition.  In fact, I am known for my use of color in paintings that make people who love color react positively.<br />I thought for sure that I would love this book when ordering it online.  I was wrong.<br />This book is among the select few art books that I own that are almost a complete waste of time.  (I try to learn something from EVERY book, no matter how horrible).<br />The paintings in this book are obnoxious to me.  The book's set up is disjointed and hard to follow.  Kind of like instructions for toy assembly with every other sentence missing.<br />There are precious few things I like about this book- one of which is his explanation of using cool and hot colors.  Pretty basic.  Tonal value maps and basic tonal sketches before color selection, again basic, but still useful to a degree.<br />That being said, I seriously can not stand his paintings, there is precious little about this book that I enjoyed.  I read it from cover to cover, as difficult as that was to force myself.  Illustrations of sketching are like chicken scratches.  Explanations are minimal and incomplete.<br />It is one of the very few art books I have purchased that I have considered to be almost a complete waste of money.<br />I would suggest that you get this book from a library if you can to view it first, if you are fortunate enough to have access to a good one, like I do not.  If you like this kind of art, then you can choose to purchase.  But, if like me, you are annoyed, you can save yourself some money.",Negative
"First, let me preface this review by saying I am not a big science fiction fan.  So, if you are, you may like this book.  I found it incredibly boring and repetitive.  As with all of Stephenie Meyer's books, they have sections where you are gripped and want to find out more, but the vast majority seems to just drag on.  I think most of her books could be cut in half and make them more readable.  I liked the Twilight Series, but this one I didn't really care for at all.",Negative
"I have no idea how this book is getting any good reviews.  It is absolutely HORRIBLE!  I consider myself a conservative Christian and this book was just way too out there for me.  The story begins with a really gripping abduction of a child and you are on the edge of your seat hoping to get their little girl back.  Then, it went immediately downhill after that.  When the guy goes to the shack and meets God (a black woman), I thought... that's interesting... I read a little further and it just went from bad to worse.  The book in no way made me feel good or gave me the desire to read on, so I quit reading half way through and threw the book in my recycle can.  It wasn't even good enough to donate or pass on in my opinion.",Negative
"I read so many good reviews here, so I thought it would be great.  However, this book is very misleading.  If you are of the LDS Faith (a Mormon), this might be helpful, as the first half of the book preaches straight religion... talks about a Family Evening night, uses a bunch of scriptures, etc.  I didn't buy this book to get a religious lesson, I bought it for emergency preparedness.  It really turned me off, which made it hard to choke down the rest of the book... even if the recipes might be good.  I will definitely be returning this book to Amazon and looking for something with a broader target audience.  What a disappointment!",Negative

"Dave, I read your book and it was painful to read, it took a month to get through it. None of it is original. It's all information taken from other people's books, reports, and internet websites. From this information Dave has fashioned his own idea of what went down that night, including an entire fictitious conversation between Patsy and Jonbenet Ramsey on the night of the murder, on which he bases his belief of Patsy Ramsey's guilt, this and the ransom note. But a ransom note does not a murderer make, Patsy was not the only one in the house that night, and he has not considered that a woman could conceivably cover for a family member. He fails to explain the many inconsistencies in the Patsy Did It Theory and simply relies on imagination to fill in the blanks. I am not comfortable calling a dead mother of a dead child a murderer with what little evidence Dave Hughes has to offer. It is obvious he cares about finding the murderer of Jonbenet, but I do not believe he is on the right track. I regret ever reading this book. I would recommend reading books written by those who actually investigated the crime, although some had differing opinions, they had first hand knowledge. One book was written by the lead investigator for the DA, James Kolar, who saw all the evidence, collected through all the years, something none of the other investigators had been able to see. All their books bring a knowledgeable, true, and first hand perspective, something &#34;An Angel Betrayed&#34; lacks.",Negative
"A friend lent this book to me, so I can't complain about the price.<br /><br />Despite the locations bouncing around London, the Middle East,Ireland and USA's president's vacation home in Connecticut (or is it Rhode Island), the action is dull and the characters are merely two-dimensional.<br /><br />So, despite being a quick read, this, for me, was boring.<br /><br />I do NOT understand how this gets an average of 3 stars, particularly in view of the fact that 56% of the reviews are 2 stars or less.",Negative

"I'd like to preface this review by stating that I typically read literary fiction, and it's clear from the get-go that this book does not fall in that category. It's what one might call a ""beach read"" and that's okay. The premise was intriguing and I did finish it, but I found a lot of things that snagged me and drew me out of the story, like when the protagonist says: ""I've got a tumor"" and doesn't say what kind or where it started, etc., and the person she's speaking to doesn't ask. That's unrealistic; when a person says they have cancer, they preface it with the type of cancer, be it pancreatic, ovarian, cervical, whatever. They don't just say ""I've got a tumor."" And why does she keep her medications in her desk drawer upstairs when most or all of them need to be taken with food? Shouldn't she keep them in the kitchen? And how can the two main characters pass snow-covered houses on their way to the airport in New England one morning, but then see fireflies in Tennessee the evening of the same day? Fireflies are only active in the middle of summer. Things like this can really draw a reader away from the flow of a story and could easily have been caught with more thorough editing.<br /><br />It is a good story, and the conclusion was satisfying. It would have been better if it had been more thoroughly edited.<br />1. I have a hard time understanding how a book that lists three editors and one proofreader made it to the printer with multiple instances of ""lay"" vs ""lie"" and ""I"" vs ""me"" errors.<br />2. There must've been almost a thousand instances in which the word ""that"" could have been deleted without any effect.<br />3. I suggest the author search the entire document for repetitions of the following words: that, turn, move, gaze, step, brow, eyebrow, beam, hunch, scrunch, drawl, slowly, carefully, gently, quietly, and any phrases involving the word ""as"" (as if, as he, as she, as soon as, as much as, etc.).<br /><br />The overuse of intentional repetition gets really tiresome toward the end of the book, as does the use of past perfect tense. The main story is told in present tense, so the bulk of the backstory could be told in simple past tense without all the clunky had/had not construction.<br />Here's an example of both from page 222:<br />""Had I been a terrible mother? I think I had been. I think I had been, and I think I'd known it, and I think I was almost happy that day, I think, when my arms were pumping, and I was sprinting through those neighborhoods, and thinking..."" I'll stop there to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's an okay story, but it could have been much better. I wanted to know how it ended, but could only get there with my editing pen in hand.",Negative
"Just how stupid do these people think we are?<br />I hate this book.  Like the other one-star reviewers, I find the cartoony illustrations and jaunty hand-printed notes in the margins to be wildly distracting.  I don't like having to sift through the intentional repetitions of the concepts just because other readers might have to read something 3 or 4 times before they absorb it.  I don't, and if I do need to go over something again, I'd rather just go back and review instead of being forced to read the same thing phrased or staged in three different ways.<br />This is the assigned textbook for an HTML class that I'm taking, and I'm going to complain to the instructor, too.",Negative

I have all of Rendell's other books but I won't buy this one.  $15 is too much for a Kindle book.  They don't have to cover the cost of printing and shipping so I think the price shouldn't exceed $9.99.  For $15 I want a hard copy book I can share with others.  I hope others refuse to buy at this price point too so the publisher gets the message.,Negative
"Honestly, I did not like this book. I wasn't fond of the characters. The plot is pretty straightforward but there's no real mystery or interesting commentary when looking back at it as a whole. Basically, it was a disappointment. There are way better things the writer could've done with the characters but they chose to make this boring and stereotypical. Do not recommend! Also, the art wasn't that great either.",Negative
For people who built million dollar businesses you would think they could afford to pay a legit editor. I'm no grammar expert but there are so many blantant errors in this book it was BRUTAL to try to get through. Wish I would have opened it back when I bought it so I could return it.,Negative
"I'm looking for a very good edition of Shakespeare's complete works for my kindle. (I used to own one of those small print books in my youth, many decades ago, but I can't read it any more.)  So I tried this one: unfortunately, although the content is excellent, the kindle edition is completely unreadable (download a sample before you buy): in trying to make it look like the printed book, they made a terrible decision. It looks like the kind of bad print you get when the ink is running out in an inkjet printer.  Ugh!",Negative
"Another Graham Greene & John Le Carre wannabe, without the required level of talent.  It's not the writing style (it's not bad, really) it's a really dumb (sophomoric) plot, developed slowly & painfully and rather pretentiously, while the characters remain rather shallow.  I lost interest about a quarter of the way through -- I stopped caring what was going to happen to the principal characters, which is rather telling.<br /><br />Also, Cumming seems to be the kind of Brit for whom the ultimate bad guys are Americans, especially the evil military-industrial-political-espionage complex.  (Yes, I know, Hollywood's full of this too.)  I can tolerate some of this nonsense if the story is compelling, but for this book it's not worth the price.",Negative

"Like so many others, I loved A Gentleman in Moscow and to a little lesser extent Rules of Civility, so I was eager to start The Lincoln Highway.  Towles is a urban dweller, and knows little about life in rural Nebraska, and those characters were so stereotypical, it almost hurt.  Some characters could be edited out with out and damage to the story line (Sally and Pastor John), and if I were his editor, I would have cut at least 100 pages from the book. The disjointed plot line jumped all over hell and back, and really added nothing to the story, just a bit of literary shenanigans.  In the end, I mostly enjoyed the Woolly and Billy characters, really never warmed up to Emmett, and really cared nothing for Duchess, as he seemed to not care about anybody but himself in the entire book. I have no patience for characters like that and was ready to pack it in half way through the book. Every writer produces a dud, and I hope this was Towles one and only.  PS.

And I’m not even going to get started with the schizophrenia-versus-demonic-possession aspect. The final chapters, when “the plot twist” is revealed, I just rolled my eyes. Silly, abrupt and not believable or satisfying. Skip this one.",Negative

"These cards may seem great at face value with its color reflective properties and all but they are really not. You cannot shuffle these like most tarot card decks. These are super delicate and almost seem like they are used for pretty show or display only. They also possess a very bad vibe & energy to them upon using them and sent them back. I even met Grace in person after the fact, and she was not a kind person at all. She is even not a part of the spiritual community. She admitted she only got into tarot cards and astrology as a bigger & better opportunity for her graphics art and app business. So there are far way better tarot card decks that you can actually shuffle and use than this one, and one with good intentions as well. This deck is just for clout and only for one person's selfish agenda.",Negative
"having read all Heyer's and many other regency authors as escape entertainment,  i decided to try balogh. a competent writer, she unfrotunately feels the need to include bedroom scenes which to me are distasteful & unnecessary in this genre. too much romance not enough regency!  balogh does write well as far as pacing but this particular story felt hollow, lacking a real feel for the times and peopled with characters who were not quite human---if you like heyer, try sandra heath, joan smith, elisabeth kidd, carola dunn, et. al. for real regency flavor without the cheap bedroom stuff. balogh is a good enough writer not to need to do this.  this book's heroine is unattractive and not at all credible with constant description of bosom and decollete, etc...really annoying. for the prurient among readers i suppose this would suit, but for someone who is genuinely interested in the social mores, the town life, the class system, etc. of the era along with a light hearted romance - look to authors mentioned above who have a firm grasp on these background details that contribute color, immediacy, and vivid sense of place and time. joan smith's A Country Wooing was an excellent portrayal of the situation of many soldiers of napoleonic wars....estates left to be run by sisters or inept managers, trying to make the estates pay for themselves, marrying based on money so desperately needed to save the family home...another aspect to regency life along with the ton, the balls, the debutantes, etc...if reading this genre, i prefer regency romances to be steeped in correct regency detail/history and the romance to be clean. i dont understand this author's popularity - wont be reading another one by her.",Negative

Rude & high maintenance.

Like those moments where you have to stop, look up at nothing saying, “really?”) because of how cheesy the dialogue is. This is so forced. The end has a semi-nice moment *sigh* (singsong) “where it all comes together…” And then the book is done!

But I'm extremely disappointed in it's &#34;cash cow&#34; status for the publisher. As for this latest edition, the price point is absurdly high considering the modest additions from the 3rd edition.",Negative
Throw the 99% of this book that is nothing but constant self loathing and whining in the garbage and the remaining might be worth reading.,Negative
"Found the book on an airport bench during a very long flight delay. Last reader would have been kinder to have placed the novel in the garbage. Page after page of stereotypical characters, sexist idiocy, and pointless page filler. I have never read Tami Hoag before so maybe this is not typical of her writing style. I will have to try another of her novels to see if her name is the reason this made it onto any best seller list. It sure didn't happen on the merit of the book. Did the next reader a favor and placed it in the receptacle that the airport provides for this type of trash.",Negative
Very disappointed with the content of this book 😒,Negative
"I purchased this because I was in the midst of preparing a college paper on Twain's use of religion and superstition in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but it not only was not what I expected, it ended up being of no use. I gained no insight into what Twain might have thought or felt at the time of writing Huck Finn because these were works from later in his life -- from a darker, more depressed state of mind. I could not even find enjoyment in reading it outside of the need created by the paper I was writing; this was not the Twain with whom I was familiar. A darker, more hopeless author conceived these pieces, and I found his state of mind entirely depressing.",Negative
Not very useful unless one applies GREAT imagination.,Negative
"At first, I thought this book was an elaborate parody of right-wing cultural hysteria.  After the second chapter, I reluctantly came to the conclusion that the author was serious, seriously hysterical, that is.  What a farce!  The Critical Theory&#34; of the Frankfurt School exiles as a dominant form of cultural discourse in America!  Marcuse was washed up in 1966.  Who reads &#34;One-Dimensional Man&#34; anymore?  Walter Benjamin spawned an industry of cultural critics of TV--what a profound influence they have had on the medium!  Erich Fromm &#34;corrupted and seduced&#34; America with his salacious opus, &#34;The Art of Loving&#34;---a tract without one ounce of eroticism.  What's almost tragic is that the Frankfurt Boys (not a single woman among them) actually had some very insightful things to say about the cultural industrial complex&#34; and how it insidiously shapes consumer character.  More so every day.  Americans could still learn a thing or two from these prescient observers.  But as actual shapers of our culture?  They would be laughing hysterically at the thought if they were around today to hear it.  Get a grip, right wing paranoiacs.  America is what you have made it.",Negative
This book appeared to be a copy of perhaps an original published book. It was not a very professional copy.<br />This was just a list of names which was of no use to me. I was not pleased. Postage to return was charged to the customer.,Negative
Broke within the first week! Cheap...do not waste your money.,Negative
I read so many good reviews so I was excited to try this but I was disappointed. I have curly color treated hair which is pretty healthy due to deep conditioning and general care. I was looking for something to help tame some frizz and fly aways but this did not work. It did nothing for my hair....absolutely nothing.,Negative
"I am an librarian and I read this book to all of my kindergarten and first grade classes. The children did not understand this book and I had to spend about 10 minutes explaining it. The book does not go into detail as to why the dog does not have a home and wants to be a fork. The kids are thoroughly confused. As an adult, I think this is a very nice book but it is not written for children.",Negative
"I don't hate the book, I detest the price.  I just bought this book from Annie's for $3.95.  Why is it on Amazon for $150something?",Negative
"I got this for my kids thinking it would have original Pixar character stories in it.  We loved Cars and The Incredibles and thought it would be fun to read new stories with those characters and more from other Pixar movies.  Well this book was a huge let down.  Most of the stories, except for 2 or 3, are the movie being retold in a shortened version.  I could have lived with that but it is so poorly written.  My kids don't seem to notice or mind, they are 4 and 2, but my husband and I definitely do.  We actually cringe whenever my son pulls this book out and asks us to read a story at bedtime.  We have so many other books that we just love and enjoy reading and this is definitely not one of them.<br /><br />Once my son forgets about this book, hopefully soon, I do plan to get rid of it so we don't have to read it anymore.  We have so many other books that are better that it seems a waste of time to read these stories.  I would not recommend this book at all and now will stay away from the Disney storybook collections.  If the others are like this one at all, I'd rather spend my money and time on other things.",Negative
"I can't say I understand all of the great reviews on this book.  Out of all the books my son has, and he has a ton, this is my least favorite.  It almost seems like the author wanted 4 lines that rhymed and it didn't matter if they went together, just rhymed.  Well if that is what you want, this is the book for you.  With so many other great baby books out there, I would recommend looking at some others over this one.  Maybe some people liked it because it really is only 8 pages (4 double sided pages) and doesn't have much text.  In fact the first two pages only say: Clap hands, stomp feet.  My son is 1 and he won't sit through a long book but this is too short and not interesting enough.<br /><br />I would recommend these books: Brown Bear and the rest of the series (my husband reads them to my son with different voices for all the animals and he loves it!), I love you through and through (my absolute favorite), Dr. Seuss' books (a few are short and are aimed at a younger audience)",Negative
"I was so excited to read this book, but the content was plain and extremely short. It felt more of a diary than poetry honestly that lacked value. I had higher expectations, but these poems were too dry. I was going to the return the book, but threw it out from the terrible content I've read.",Negative
i did not find this useful. it seems like these companies and using you to make money by charging people to enter contests that one person out of 1000's will win.,Negative
The paperback book is so small. Very few recipes. Basic information you can pull off the web. I do not recommend this book to anyone. Over priced. It reads as if a preschooler wrote it. Absolute Garbage.,Negative
THIS OOK IS COMPLETE ONE SIDED GARBAGE,Negative
"I know Dan Jenkins is a coveted sports writer but man, can he ease up on the ""n"" word. I'm a golfer but I was turned off by it. Watch the HBO movie version. They substitute the ""n"" word with ""ethnics"" which is (sigh) obvious. In my opinion, Randy Quaid has the best golf swing for an actor. And there's a good nude scene by Corinne Bohrer.",Negative
I bought this as a present for a friend who is not a cook. She has to prepare food for her aging parents and I thought this would be perfect for her. Not! Each recipe is way overloaded with sodium Would have killed her parents and certainly not good for anyone else either.,Negative
"APPALLED! RECEIVED *USED* PAD OF PAPER. If this product were new, it would be five stars. The drawings are cute and would make a fine gift for my niece. However, Not only is the outside marred and falling apart, but the pad has only 23 of the advertised 40 sheets. And some kid has already scribbled on the inside cover and several of the pages. What in holy frikken Hades? Who wants a USED pad of paper ever? Much one less that was supposed to arrive new? I demand justice! I will have vengeance! A plague on the piteous pustule who send this to me. I curse your eyes, your eyesight, and your sense of smell. May you never know love or enjoy the satisfaction that your presence has enriched the life of even a single person. May your dreams be haunted by the ever looming specter of your inadequacy to meet even the most basic standards of humanity, you stooped sack of putrid flesh.",Negative
Hard to learn and use. Little in the way of useful tutorials. Its like listening to an accountant. Opaque.,Negative
Never received.,Negative
Honestly I read reviews and thought this would be cute. It really doesn't move at all. When you push it it flops down and goes straight back up. Note to self.....play the lottery instead.,Negative
"Don't even know if this is good. Unless you have a PC machine, forget about this book. You are supposed to download free software, enter your info, get your report.... eh, only for PC or PC simulated Mac. Not worth it to waste your time. $20 for this book alone is too expensive. Wish i can return....",Negative
small booklet<br />not worth the price,Negative
There is nothing cozy about this mystery. I’ve heard what a great writer he is but a little less brutality and a little more story would be good,Negative
